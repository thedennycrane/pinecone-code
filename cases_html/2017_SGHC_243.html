As a consequence of the defendant’s breach, the plaintiff terminated the agreement. The defendant alleged that it was induced to enter into the lease agreement by fraudulent, negligent and/or innocent misrepresentations made by the plaintiff. In its counterclaim, the defendant sought an order that the lease agreement be set aside and/or damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The defendant’s claims for misrepresentation arose from four alleged representations which it referred to as Representations on Live Entertainment, Representations on Operating Hours, Representations on Catering and Representations on Take-out (see [24] below). The defendant succeeded in proving only the misrepresentation arising from the Representations on Live Entertainment. However, I found that the defendant was not entitled to rescind the lease agreement because it had affirmed the agreement. Consequently, the defendant remained liable to pay rent and breached the lease agreement by failing to do so. I therefore gave judgment for the plaintiff. I also found that the defendant failed to prove its loss caused by the misrepresentation and accordingly, I awarded the defendant nominal damages only. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The defendant has appealed against the whole of my decision except for my finding that it had proved the misrepresentation arising from the Representations on Live Entertainment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff was at all material times the retail operator of Kallang Wave Mall at 1 Stadium Place, Singapore (“the Mall”).

The planned trade mix for these units was food and beverage (“F&amp;B”). The defendant was then operating a pub, club and/or bar called “China One” at Clarke Quay, 3E River Valley Road, Singapore. On 17 September 2013, the defendant submitted a concept proposal and business budget plan.

This meant that the Premises could not be operated solely as a bar.

In my view, cl 2(b) of the LOO did not assist the plaintiff. The defendant was relying on the plaintiff’s representation that the Premises were already approved for use as a pub with live entertainment. The question of applying for a change of use therefore did not arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Representations on Operating Hours</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had represented that the defendant could operate a pub, bar and club providing live entertainment at the Premises until “the early hours of the morning”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Pursuant to cl 2(b) of the LOO and cl 5.1.2 of the Lease Agreement, the defendant was responsible for obtaining the necessary liquor and public entertainment licences that would allow it to sell alcohol and provide live entertainment at the Premises.

There was also no question that the defendant knew that the operating hours for selling alcohol and providing live entertainment depended on the liquor and public entertainment licences that it had to apply for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I found that there was no express representation that the defendant would be able to operate a pub, bar and club providing live entertainment until the early hours of the morning. The application for the liquor and public entertainment licences had nothing to do with the plaintiff. It did not make sense that the plaintiff would have made the express representation as alleged. For the same reason, there was also no reason to imply the alleged representation. The defendant may have expected to be able to obtain the licences with the operating hours that it wanted but clearly, the plaintiff could not be held responsible for the defendant’s inability to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In any event, even if there was an express or implied representation as alleged, it was clear that the defendant could not be said to have relied on any such representation knowing as it did that the operating hours depended on the licences that it had to apply for.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Representations on Catering and Representations on Take-out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The defendant’s case was that the plaintiff expressly represented that the defendant would be able to cater and provide take-out food and beverage services for the significant number of events and attendees at the Sports Hub including the Sports Facilities. As it turned out, the defendant could not cater for events at the Sports Hub because the Sports Hub had appointed an exclusive caterer for events at the Sports Hub. In addition, the conditions of entry into the Sports Facilities provided that “outside food and beverage” could not be brought into these venues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my judgment, the evidence fell short of proving the alleged express representations. What seemed clear was that there was mention that there would be a lot of events held at the Sports Hub. What was not so clear was whether Elyn actually said that the defendant would be able to cater the food for these events or that persons could bring food and drinks purchased from the defendant’s take-out counter into the Sports Facilities. Obviously, there was nothing to stop the defendant from providing catering services generally. There was also nothing to stop anyone from buying food and drinks from the defendant’s take-out counter so long as they did not also bring them into the Sports Facilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Tony’s testimony in court was equivocal. He said that Elyn told him there would be “lots of events around here ... a lot of people coming here for after party and all that. <span class="font-italic">You can have events and caterings for them</span>” [emphasis added].

</div> In my view, Tony’s answer during cross-examination was to be preferred. If Elyn had in fact made such a clear representation as Tony asserted during re-examination, there was no reason why Tony would not have said so during cross-examination. Neither did Tony explain why he gave the answer that he did during cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my view it was more probable that the defendant had simply assumed that it could cater for events (other than its own) at the Sports Hub and that its food and beverages could be brought into the Sports Facilities. This was corroborated by the evidence of one of the defendant’s witnesses, Wong Kang Kin, a Food and Beverage Consultant who had invested in the defendant. He testified that when Tony and he were told of the high number of events, they “thought” that they would get some of the business and also have some takeaway business.

However, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant was not entitled to rescind the Lease Agreement because (a) the Representations on Live Entertainment subsequently ceased to be false, (b) the defendant had settled the dispute with the plaintiff, and/or (c) the defendant had affirmed the Lease Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Representations on Live Entertainment subsequently ceased to be false</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The plaintiff submitted that the defendant lost its right to rescind the Lease Agreement because subsequent appeals to the URA led to the defendant obtaining approvals for its intended use of the Premises. I disagreed with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The URA permitted live entertainment at the Premises only if it was ancillary to the use of the Premises as a restaurant and even then, the permission was only for one year with further extensions being subject to review (see [14] above). This was clearly different from the implied representation that there was planning permission to operate a pub with live entertainment for the duration of the five-year lease (see [29] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a settlement agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In its closing submissions, the plaintiff submitted that there was a settlement agreement between the parties dated 25 August 2014. The defendant argued that this had not been pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It was not disputed that that alleged settlement agreement was not pleaded in the statement of claim or the reply and defence to counterclaim. The plaintiff pointed out that in its rejoinder, the defendant had pleaded that it had entered into negotiations with the plaintiff but no agreement was reached. The plaintiff argued that since there was an implied joinder of issues to the defendant’s rejoinder, this meant that the plaintiff’s position was that the negotiations ended in an agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I rejected the plaintiff’s creative but unsustainable submission. In my view, the fact that a settlement agreement had been reached had to be pleaded as a positive assertion. The plaintiff had not done so and therefore could not raise the alleged settlement agreement as part of its case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant had affirmed the Lease Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Having discovered the misrepresentation arising from the Representations on Live Entertainment at the latest by July 2014, the defendant nevertheless responded to the plaintiff’s notice to take possession by taking possession of the Premises in September 2014, carrying out fitting works till November 2014, commencing business in November 2014, paying rent for December 2014 and making the subsequent payments of $64,143.16 and $10,000 towards the outstanding rent. The plaintiff submitted that the defendant had, by its conduct, affirmed the Lease Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 A representee’s election whether to rescind or to affirm the contract may be by express words or by an unequivocal act: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong, ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 11.120. In the present case, it was clear that the defendant’s acts were unequivocal in affirming the Lease Agreement. The acts were done despite the fact that the defendant’s requests for a reduction in rent had not been acceded to. There was also no evidence that these acts were being done under protest. The only inference that could be drawn from the defendant’s conduct was that the defendant intended to carry on with the Lease Agreement. Even if the payments of $64,143.16 and $10,000 were excluded because, as Tony alleged, they were made in order to keep the negotiations on rent alive, the evidence was still clear that the defendant carried on with the Lease Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 However, the defendant submitted that it could not be taken to have affirmed the Lease Agreement unless it had knowledge of the existence, nature and extent of his right to rescind. The question was whether knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to rescind was sufficient or whether the defendant also had to have knowledge that it had a right in law to choose between affirmation and rescission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Peyman v Lanjani</span> [1985] Ch 475 (“<span class="font-italic">Peyman</span>”) the English Court of Appeal held (at 487F–G) that the plaintiff “must also know that the law gives him that right [to rescind] yet choose with that knowledge not to exercise it.” <span class="font-italic">Peyman </span>was applied by the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 374 at [23] and in <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town Corp</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 339. The Court of Appeal in deciding the appeal in the latter case did not opine affirmatively on the point as the facts of the case showed that the representee possessed knowledge of both facts giving rise to the right to rescind and the right itself: <span class="font-italic">Jurong Town Corp v Wishing Star Ltd </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 283 at [164]. See <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 11.150.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Although it appears that <span class="font-italic">Peyman </span>represents the law in England on this issue, it is not without controversy. It has been argued that <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> was wrongly decided: K R Handley, “Exploring Election” (2006) 122 LQR 82. In that article, Justice Handley reviewed several Australian and English cases which did not support <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span>. Justice Handley also questioned the view in <span class="font-italic">Peyman </span>that an elector who affirms without being aware of his right is only bound if there is an estoppel. His Honour reasoned (at 96) that that view was “inconsistent with the principle that an election depends on what a party does, not what he causes the other party to do, and that it takes effect when communicated, without any need for an alteration of position.” Finally, Justice Handley expressed the following view (at 97):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Ignorance of the law is generally treated as a misfortune, not an advantage. In <span class="font-italic">Hourigan v Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd</span> Dixon J quoted Knight Bruce LJ saying in 1857 “generally when the facts are known … the right is presumed to be known”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Disputes about an election normally arise because the other party relies on an earlier election to defeat a later attempt to elect the other way. Legal professional privilege would make it difficult for that party to prove that the elector was aware of his right at the earlier time. A rule that knowledge of the right had to be proved would encourage perjury and reward those who do not seek advice …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> (Michael Furmston, ed) (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2010) expressed the view (at p 930) that <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> “might be seen in the context of its special facts, notably, the helplessness of P, however, commercial law rarely makes allowance for ignorance of language or of local law”. They also opined that perhaps the better view is that knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right is enough because “a rule by reference to actual knowledge of rights makes it very difficult for the other party to decide whether he can safely rely on what appears to be affirmation”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The uncertainty as to whether the electing party must know of its legal rights was also examined in Dominic O’Sullivan, Steven Elliott &amp; Rafal Zakrzewski, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Rescission</span> (Oxford University Press, 2008) at paras 23.34–23.49. After reviewing English and Australian cases, the authors concluded (at para 23.48) that affirmation should not require knowledge of the right to rescind, giving reasons similar to those stated in Exploring Election and in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my judgment, the better view is that knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to rescind is sufficient, for all of the reasons stated in Exploring Election, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> and <span class="font-italic">The Law of Rescission</span>. I see no reason why a representee should benefit from his own ignorance of the law especially when that ignorance arose from his own decision not to seek advice despite having learnt of the representor’s wrongdoing in making a false representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, even if knowledge of the right to rescind was required, I was satisfied that the defendant was aware that it had such a right. In his WhatsApp conversation with Elyn on 1 August 2014, Tony said that he hoped the case could be closed at the meeting to be held later that day “or [the defendant] may have to close this chapter”.

In my view, Tony’s WhatsApp messages meant that the defendant may have to walk away from the lease.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, “walking away” from the lease would be tantamount to rescinding the lease only if the defendant could do so without being in breach.

In my view, Tony’s WhatsApp messages and testimony showed that he was aware that the defendant had the right to rescind the Lease Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I concluded that the defendant was not entitled to rescind the Lease Agreement because it had affirmed the agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s remedies for the defendant’s breaches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As the defendant had affirmed the Lease Agreement, it remained liable to pay rent. It failed to do so and thus breached the Lease Agreement. Clause 11.1 of the Lease Agreement gave the plaintiff the right to terminate the lease by serving three days’ written notice or by re-entering the Premises if rent or any other amounts payable by the defendant remained unpaid for seven days after becoming due.

</div> As stated earlier, the plaintiff terminated the lease by re-entering the Premises on 1 October 2015 (see [22] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Consequent upon the defendant’s breach of the Lease Agreement, the plaintiff was also entitled to recover the outstanding rental, late payment interest at 12% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> (pursuant to cl 13.2 of the Lease Agreement), damages and costs on an indemnity basis (pursuant to cl 18.4.2 of the Lease Agreement). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The outstanding rental for the period from February 2015 to September 2015 plus late payment interest as at 1 October 2015 amounted to $562,441.31. Late payment interest continued to accrue at 12% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> on the principal sum of $538,942.94 from 1 October 2015 until full payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff claimed the sum of $2,155,294.02 as damages. This amount comprised the following: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center">(a)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">Costs of re-entry (hoarding the Premises)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">$2,846.20</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center">(b)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">Costs of reinstating the Premises</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">$115,842.90</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center">(c)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">Clawback of rent (pursuant to cl 2.7 of the Lease Agreement) for the fitting out period which was granted to the defendant rent-free</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">$154,050.77</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center">(d)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">Loss of rent from 1 October 2015 until 6 December 2016</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">$941,928.29</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center">(e)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">Shortfall in rent from 7 December 2016 to 8 November 2019</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">$1,181,162.72</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center">(f)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">LESS: Security deposit</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">($240,536.86)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">TOTAL</div></td><td><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-right">$2,155,294.02</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendant did not challenge the plaintiff’s evidence on the amount of loss suffered. In its closing submissions, the defendant did not challenge the plaintiff’s computation of damages. I therefore awarded the plaintiff damages in the sum of $2,155,294.02 plus interest at 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> from the date of the writ to the date of judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendant’s claim for damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65  Although the defendant was not entitled to rescind the Lease Agreement, it remained entitled to damages for loss suffered in respect of its misrepresentation claim based on the Representations on Live Entertainment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, on 27 November 2014, the defendant received formal written permission to operate a restaurant with ancillary bar and ancillary live entertainment. On 4 December 2014, the defendant was given a liquor licence and a public entertainment licence (which permitted live entertainment including dancing) for a year with daily operating hours ending at 11.59 pm. The defendant was therefore able to operate a pub with live entertainment. By 12 December 2014, the defendant’s restaurant, bar and club on the Premises was fully operational. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is true that the defendant was only given permission to operate a bar with live entertainment ancillary to its operation of the restaurant. However, there was no evidence of the loss suffered by the defendant as a result of this constraint imposed by the URA. Further, although the URA’s permission was granted for a period of one year, it could be renewed. In my view, the possibility that a renewal might not be granted by the URA was too speculative. There was no evidence that suggested that it would not be renewed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It is also true that the defendant could not operate its pub and live entertainment business past midnight. However, that had nothing to do with the Representations on Live Entertainment. As stated earlier, the defendant failed in its misrepresentation claim arising from the Representations on Operating Hours. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my judgment, the defendant failed to prove that it suffered any loss as a result of its reliance on the Representations on Live Entertainment (which turned out to be false). In the circumstances, I awarded the defendant nominal damages in the sum of $5,000 in respect of its misrepresentation claim based on the Representations on Live Entertainment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It seemed to me that the real reason for the defendant’s unhappiness was the plaintiff’s refusal to reduce the rent despite that fact that the defendant was unable to operate the bar and provide live entertainment past midnight or, as the defendant put it, until the early hours of the morning. However, the plaintiff was under no legal obligation to reduce the rent. It was the defendant itself that was unable to obtain the necessary liquor licence and public entertainment licence with longer operating hours. The defendant had made its plans on the assumption that it would be able to obtain the licenses to operate past midnight. This assumption turned out to be wrong and the defendant had to bear the consequences. The defendant had not protected itself against this eventuality in the Lease Agreement and it was not for the court to rewrite the Lease Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Although the defendant succeeded in its misrepresentation claim arising from the Representations on Live Entertainment, it was not entitled to rescind the Lease Agreement because it had affirmed the agreement. In the circumstances, the defendant’s failure to pay rent was a breach of the Lease Agreement. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to judgment for outstanding rent, interest and damages. As the defendant failed to prove its loss arising from its misrepresentation claim, it was only entitled to nominal damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I entered judgment for the plaintiff for (a) $562,441.31 being outstanding rent and interest as of 1 October 2015 together with interest at 12% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> (as provided for under the Lease Agreement) on the principal sum of $538,942.94 from 1 October 2015 until payment, and (b) $2,155,294.02 being damages together with interest at 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> from the date of the writ until judgment. As for the defendant’s counterclaim, I awarded it nominal damages in the sum of $5,000. Finally, I awarded the plaintiff costs on an indemnity basis (as provided for under the Lease Agreement) fixed at $250,000 plus GST, and disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ling Tien Wah, Wah Hsien-Wen Terence, Chew Di Shun Dickson (Zhou Dishun) (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Suhami Bin Lazim, Chow Jian Hong (Mirandah Law LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
