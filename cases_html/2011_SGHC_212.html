<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused, Wang Jian Bin, pleaded guilty to
                    and was convicted of a charge under s 375(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) for raping a girl
                    under 14 years of age (“the victim”). The victim was only 13 years
                    old at the material time. This offence is punishable under s 375(2), PC which
                    provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and/or a fine
                    and/or caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The following charges were taken into
                    consideration for sentencing:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">One charge of criminal intimidation under s 506
                            (first limb), PC for threatening the victim to bring his gang to her
                            home to cause trouble, and to tell her parents that she had had sex with
                            her boyfriend, intending to cause the victim to meet him, which she was
                            not legally bound to do.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">One charge under s 376A(1)(<em>b</em>), PC and punishable under s 376A(3), PC for
                            penetrating with his finger the vagina of the victim.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I sentenced the accused to 13 years’
                    imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The accused filed an appeal against his
                    sentence. I now set out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The accused is a 24 year-old male, who was 23
                    years old at the time he committed the offences. He came to Singapore from China
                    with his family in 1997 and became a Singapore citizen in 2005. Prior to his
                    arrest, he was a student of Temasek Polytechnic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In October 2009, the accused contacted the
                    victim <em>via</em> MSN messenger (“MSN”). He
                    had come across her email address in the ‘making friends’ column of
                        <em>Teenage</em> magazine. They then chatted <em>via</em> MSN from time to time. During the course of these
                    conversations, the victim revealed her real name, and that she was 13 years old
                    and a Secondary One student.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The accused then asked for the victim’s
                    mobile number and they started to communicate <em>via</em>
                    text messages and telephone calls. When the accused steered the conversation
                    towards intimate topics by asking the victim questions such as whether she
                    masturbated, what the colours of her bra and panties were, and what her bra cup
                    size was, the victim felt uncomfortable and decided to avoid the accused’s
                    calls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Undeterred, the accused continued to send the
                    victim numerous text messages asking to meet her. Some of these text messages
                    were sexually explicit , <em>eg</em>, whether he could
                    ‘finger’ her (meaning to use his fingers to penetrate her vagina).
                    He also asked her whether she had a boyfriend and whether she had had sexual
                    intercourse with her boyfriend. To this last enquiry, the victim replied that
                    she had a boyfriend and had engaged in sexual intercourse with him as she
                    thought that this would put an end to the accused’s harassment. She also
                    stated that she was not interested in meeting the accused and told him to stop
                    sending her text messages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Even so, the accused continued to send the
                    victim text messages. On 2 December 2009, the accused texted the victim to ask
                    for her address and whether he could meet her at her home. He told the victim
                    that he wanted to go to her room to “play” with her and
                    “touch [her] body”. He also expressly told her that he wanted to
                    touch her “pussy” (referring to her vulva) and asked her if she
                    had a condom at home. He instructed the victim prepare for his arrival at her
                    house by masturbating herself and by changing into either a skirt without
                    underwear or into a big shirt without shorts and underwear, so that it would be
                    “easy” for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The victim was with a 17 year-old Chinese male
                    friend (“W1”) at the time when she received the text messages.
                    When the accused learnt that she was with a male friend, he issued a series of
                    threats to back his demands. He told the victim that he would “play
                    gangster” and “find… trouble” for W1 and herself if
                    she did not tell the accused her address. He also stated that W1 should watch
                    out as he could “bring [his] gang down” anytime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Despite the threats, the victim refused to
                    meet the accused, giving him a range of excuses. She also told him that she did
                    not want him to touch her. The victim even asked W1 to pose as her father and
                    call the accused to tell him to stop harassing her. However, the accused was not
                    convinced and insisted on going to the victim’s house. He then told the
                    victim that he already knew where she lived (as she had given him her address in
                    an earlier conversation) and threatened to bring his gang to her house to
                    “disturb” her and “mess up” her flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     By this time, W1 had called another male
                    Chinese friend, 18 years of age (“W2”), to come to the
                    victim’s house to help them and W2 duly did so. W1 also telephoned the
                    police to report the accused’s harassment of the victim, but told the
                    police that there was no need to send officers yet because the accused had not
                    yet come to the victim’s home. He told the police officer that he would
                    call again once the accused arrived at the victim’s house. The victim
                    asked W1 and W2 to hide in her mother’s room when the accused arrived. She
                    would then tell the accused to leave and asked W1 and W2 to call for help if she
                    could not handle the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When the accused arrived at the victim’s
                    flat, she recognised him from his photograph on Facebook. While outside her
                    door, the accused repeated his threats to call his gang if she did not bring him
                    to her room quickly. As if to make good his threat, the accused took out his
                    mobile phone and appeared ready to call someone. Out of fear, the victim let him
                    into her flat. W1 then telephoned the police for assistance. At that time, along
                    with W1 and W2, the victim’s brother and his piano teacher were also in
                    the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The accused walked behind her, pushing her at
                    her back, as she walked to her room. She believed that he would not dare to do
                    anything to her as there were many other people in her house. Unfortunately, she
                    was wrong. The accused shut her room door but left it unlocked at her request.
                    He then told her that he wanted to hug her, but pushed her onto the bed, laid on
                    top of her and started touching her breasts. The victim told him that he had
                    only asked for a hug and that she did not allow him to do such things to her.
                    She said that she would scream for help if he did not move away from
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The accused warned her that if she screamed he
                    would call his gang, and would tell her parents that she had had sexual
                    intercourse with her boyfriend. She fell silent and he then inserted his fingers
                    into her vagina and moved them in and out, causing her pain. The victim tried to
                    push him away but to no avail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At this point, W2 opened the door to her
                    bedroom and saw what the accused was doing to the victim. W2 then hit the
                    accused on the back with the blunt end of a Chinese martial arts spear that
                    belonged to the victim’s brother. The accused struggled with W2 for some
                    time, until the accused told the victim to tell W2 to leave; otherwise he would
                    carry out his earlier threats. On hearing this, the victim whispered to W2 to
                    call the police. W2 accordingly left the room and went with W1 to seek help from
                    the nearby fire post.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Following this, the accused instructed the
                    victim to close the door, and pushed her onto the bed again. He then pulled down
                    his shorts and pulled down the victim’s shorts and panties. Although she
                    tried to push him away, he overpowered her and continued to touch her breasts.
                    The accused again inserted his fingers into, and moved them in and out of the
                    victim’s vagina. He subsequently inserted his penis into the
                    victim’s vagina and moved it in and out of her vagina, causing her
                    considerable pain. Despite her resistance, and to prevent her from screaming,
                    the accused kissed the victim on her mouth. A while later, the accused
                    ejaculated, and the victim felt something wet at her vagina.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At about this time, the victim heard
                    W1’s voice outside her room and she told the accused that the police had
                    arrived. She then put on her clothes and quickly walked out of her room. The
                    accused pulled up his shorts and followed behind her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     W1 and W2 had returned with several Singapore
                    Civil Defence Force officers from the nearby fire post. The officers separated
                    the accused from the victim when they came out of the room. Shortly thereafter,
                    the police arrived to arrest the accused. After his arrest, the accused sent the
                    victim a text message to apologise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Benchmark sentences for rape </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>PP v NF</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<em>PP v
                    NF</em>”), V K Rajah J (as he then was) considered and adopted
                    the four broad categories of rape elucidated in <em>R v Keith
                        Billam</em> (1986) 8 Cr App R (S) 48 (“<em>Billam</em>”) for sentencing purposes. In discussing the
                        <em>Billam</em> classification system, Rajah J opined
                    as follows (at 19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These categories were designed and calibrated to ensure both stability and
                        a measure of predictability in sentencing rape offenders by assigning a
                        benchmark sentence to each category.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>PP v UI</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 500, the Court of Appeal endorsed the principles and
                    sentencing benchmarks set out in <em>PP v
                NF</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The four categories were arranged in ascending
                    order of severity. At the lowest end of the spectrum were the “Category
                    1” rapes, which featured no aggravating or mitigating circumstances.
                    Rajah J affirmed the finding in <em>Chia Kim Heng Frederick
                        v PP</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 that the starting point
                    for sentencing in such cases was ten years’ imprisonment and not less than
                    six strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Rajah J set out in some detail at
                        [20] in <em>PP v
                        NF</em> certain aggravating features, which if present, would bring
                    the case within “Category 2”. Rape of a child was identified as
                    one of those in “Category 2” (see (d) at [20] of <em>PP v
                    NF</em>). Rajah J explained at [25] that the “common thread running through category 2
                    rapes is that there has been exploitation of a particularly vulnerable
                    victim”. The starting point for “Category 2” rapes was 15
                    years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     “Category 3” featured cases
                    where the accused raped multiple victims or the same victim repeatedly.
                    “Category 4” dealt with cases where the offender
                    “manifested perverted or psychopathic tendencies or gross personality
                    disorder, and where he is likely, if at large, to remain a danger to women for
                    an indefinite time” (<em>Billam</em> at 50-51).
                    We were not concerned with Categories 3 and 4 here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I noted the caution in <em>PP v
                        NF</em> (at [43]) that
                    although sentencing benchmarks served to provide stability and predictability in
                    sentencing, they were “never [to] be applied mechanically, without a
                    proper and assiduous examination and understanding of the factual matrix of the
                    case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I would now proceed to examine all the
                    aggravating and mitigating factors in this case. The appropriate sentence for
                    each case must depend on its own set of facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plea of guilt and remorse</p>

                    (“Mr Choh”), counsel for the accused, submitted that the
                    accused pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was cooperative throughout
                    the police investigation. While it is a trite proposition that a timeous plea of
                    guilt indicative of genuine remorse is a mitigating factor, it is equally trite
                    that a plea of guilt does not <em>ipso facto</em> entitle
                    an offender to a discount in his sentence. What needs to be demonstrated is
                    genuine remorse. As held in <em>Xia Qin Lai v PP</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 257 (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">there is no mitigation value in a plea of guilt if the offender pleaded
                        guilty in the circumstances knowing that the Prosecution would have no
                        difficulty in proving the charge against him, or if he had been caught
                        red-handed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the instant case, the accused was arrested
                    at the scene of the rape, immediately after the commission of the offence. W1
                    and W2 had witnessed the accused pushing the victim into her bedroom, and W2 had
                    seen the accused using his fingers to penetrate the victim’s vagina. The
                    accused’s DNA was discovered in the pubic region swab and the vulva swab
                    taken from the victim shortly after the rape. The evidence was indeed
                    overwhelming and the Prosecution would not have any difficulty proving the three
                    charges against the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     To the extent that the accused’s
                    cooperation during police investigations and his plea of guilt had been
                    motivated, not by genuine remorse, but by his knowledge that it would be futile
                    to claim trial and deny his offences when questioned by the police as he was
                    caught red-handed, the degree of leniency that could be shown on account of
                    these mitigating factors must be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, I believed that there was some degree
                    of remorse on the part of the accused and I took this into consideration when I
                    determined the appropriate sentence. The accused had sent a text message to the
                    victim to apologise shortly after his arrest. However, the sincerity of his
                    apology <em>via</em> a text message and the weight to be
                    given to it should not be overstated. The accused belongs to a generation where
                    texting and other means of virtual communication are the preferred or even
                    default modes of communication. It would have been all-too-easy for the accused
                    to simply dash off a quick text message of apology to the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Quite apart from the issue of remorse, I
                    attached some weight to the fact that the accused’s plea of guilt had
                    spared the young victim the ordeal of testifying in a trial and re-living the
                    horror that he had inflicted on her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of antecedents and general good conduct prior to commission of
                offence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Choh drew the court’s attention
                    to the fact that this was the accused’s first offence and highlighted
                    positive testimonials the accused had received from his course manager in
                    Temasek Polytechnic and his Company Commander during his stint in National
                    Service. The accused’s course manager stated that the accused was a
                    conscientious, responsible and respectful student; serious in his studies;
                    independent and reliable; and had strong leadership skills. His Company
                    Commander stated that the accused was an honest, hardworking and diligent
                    soldier who discharged his duties with care and dedication despite his personal
                    problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Therefore, in view of the fact that the
                    accused was young and could still look forward to a bright future, Mr Choh
                    urged the court to allow the accused to have a second chance and not to impose
                    too long a custodial sentence on him. This was a consideration that I took into
                    account, but in the light of the totality of the circumstances, I felt that a
                    custodial sentence of 13 years was nonetheless warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of intention to carry out his threats</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     While the accused admitted that he had
                    threatened to tell the victim’s parents about her sexual experience with
                    her boyfriend if she refused to meet him on 2 December 2009, Mr Choh
                    submitted that this was done in a moment of rashness and anger and that the
                    accused had never intended to carry out his threat. Mr Choh pointed out
                    that the accused had not brought anyone along with him to the victim’s
                    flat. Although Mr Choh did not make this clear, I understood this to be in
                    reference to the accused’s threat to bring his gang to the victim’s
                    house to make trouble for her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     However, I found that the accused manipulated
                    the victim, and exploited the young victim’s gullibility and vulnerability
                    when he lied to her that he would bring his gang to cause trouble at the
                    victim’s house. To force the young victim to capitulate, he put as much
                    fear into the victim as he possibly could by exaggerating his threats and the
                    amount of trouble that she would face should he carry them out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     His actions on 2 December 2009 revealed
                    that he was aware of the effects of his unrelenting threats on the victim and he
                    was clearly determined to break her resolve to stand up to him each time she
                    resisted him. First, when the accused was outside the victim’s door, he
                    pretended to take out his mobile phone as if to call someone to back up his
                    threat to call his gang to the victim’s house to frighten the victim into
                    letting him into her house. Second, the accused repeated this threat while he
                    pinned the victim down on her bed, when the victim said that she would scream
                    for help if he did not get away from her. He also threatened to tell the
                    victim’s parents of her sexual intercourse with her boyfriend if she
                    resisted. Third, the accused reiterated the threats while he was struggling with
                    W2, in order to get the victim to tell W2 to leave her room. The accused
                    succeeded in using such devious means to coerce the victim to do what he wanted.
                    Under these circumstances, I found no mitigating value in the accused’s
                    absence of intention to go through with his threats.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Personal circumstances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Choh also asked the court to have
                    regard to the fact that the accused came from a broken family and that his
                    parents’ divorce had greatly affected the accused. While I accepted that
                    the accused was affected by his parents’ divorce and marital problems, I
                    noted however that the psychiatric report mentioned that the accused denied
                    having any low mood or symptoms associated with a depressive disorder.
                    Therefore, I was unable to give much weight to this mitigating factor alluded to
                    by Mr Choh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Aggravating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Harm to the victim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     A central principle of sentencing is that the
                    court should take into account the degree of harm occasioned to the victim. It
                    is well-documented in psychological literature that the degree of harm
                    occasioned by sexual assault is exacerbated where young persons are the victims
                    of rape (<em>PP v NF</em> at [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This was borne out in the present case.
                    Dr Cai Yiming of the Child Guidance Clinic at the Institute of Mental
                    Health conducted a psychiatric examination on the victim and diagnosed the
                    victim as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder which was likely to last
                    at least six months. At the psychiatric examination, the victim stated that she
                    had felt “very painful” when the accused raped her, and that she
                    had flashbacks of the rape. She had also started to imagine perverted things,
                    became sensitive to boys and whatever they did seemed wrong to her. In addition,
                    the victim was “irritable and easily became agitated and boiling
                    inside” when her younger brother talked about rape. In addition, the
                    victim had trouble sleeping.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I took this aggravating factor into account
                    for the purpose of sentencing. The victim had suffered much emotionally and
                    mentally from the trauma of the rape, and this could have long term adverse
                    effects on her emotional well-being and her ability to form relationships in the
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other aggravating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I considered that this case disclosed numerous
                    other aggravating facts. Some of these formed the subject matter of two
                    outstanding offences (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) taken
                    into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. I treated them in a like
                    manner as aggravating facts disclosed in the statement of facts admitted without
                    qualification by the accused. Had these two outstanding offences been proceeded
                    with by the Prosecution, the accused would be exposed to the risk of a higher
                    overall sentence due to the possibility of consecutive sentencing, which
                    fortunately for the accused was avoided in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     First, as noted earlier, the accused had been
                    harassing and threatening the young victim over a period of several weeks. He
                    ignored the victim’s requests for him to leave her alone. He repeatedly
                    threatened to use his gang connections to cause trouble for the victim and at
                    her home in order to make her succumb to his demands. The psychiatric
                    examination of the victim revealed that she was indeed fearful of the accused,
                    and that this fear was the reason why she had allowed him to enter her bedroom.
                    The victim’s fear of the accused can also be seen in her plan to have W1
                    and W2 hide in her house to offer her protection from the accused.
                    Unfortunately, W1 and W2’s actions were too little, too late, and were
                    ultimately unable to protect the victim from the accused’s perpetration of
                    the offences against her. On the facts admitted by the accused, I found that he
                    had systematically exploited the vulnerable nature of this young victim by
                    frightening her into yielding to his demands, and he could then carry out his
                    devious plan to sexually attack her at her home. I had to take this aggravating
                    factor taken into account when I sentenced the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Second, the accused had perpetrated other acts
                    of perversity on the victim before raping her. The accused pushed the victim
                    into her bedroom, kissed and groped her. He inserted his fingers on two separate
                    occasions into her vagina and moved them in and out of her vagina causing her
                    pain. That the victim was forced to endure the degradation from these multiple
                    sexual indignities in addition to the rape was another serious aggravating
                    factor to be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Third, the accused raped the victim at her
                    home, in her bedroom and on her bed. In <em>PP v Robiul
                        Bhoreshuddin Mondal</em> [2010] SGHC 10, weight was placed
                    on the fact that the victim had been raped “in the sanctity of her locked
                    room and on the bed on which she rested every night and which she had to
                    continue to use after the [rape]”. Instead of being her haven and
                    sanctuary, the accused had turned her home into a constant reminder of her agony
                    during the rape.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The need for general deterrence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Prosecution pressed for a deterrent
                    sentence to be passed. I agreed that this case called for a message of general
                    deterrence to be sent out. The sordid facts of this case read like a cautionary
                    tale of the digital age. When the victim published her email in the seemingly
                    innocuously-titled ‘making friends’ column of Teenage magazine, she
                    enabled any person who picked up the magazine to come into contact with her and
                    initiate conversations <em>via</em> email, MSN or Facebook.
                    The parties might then move on to conversing <em>via</em>
                    telephone conversations or text messages. The ease with which conversations can
                    be initiated has vastly increased with the technological innovations of today.
                    However, as the victim in this case found out, this also means that the multiple
                    channels of communication make the termination of such undesirable and unwelcome
                    conversations and messaging even harder should the need arise. The accused in
                    this case was able to continue his harassment of the victim for several weeks.
                    While new media and technological advances can be utilised for a great many
                    purposes, the unimpeded harassment of vulnerable young persons is not a use that
                    we, as a society, are prepared to accept. Sexual predators who seek to use these
                    avenues to seek out, harass and threaten young and vulnerable persons and
                    shelter, faceless, behind such modes of communication, deserve the severe
                    reprobation of society. There is also a pressing need for greater vigilance
                    amongst parents and parental figures to ensure that predatory figures are not
                    able to gather personal information about their children and use such
                    information to seek them out, harass and threaten them, and exploit their
                    vulnerabilities in order to facilitate commission of sexual offences against
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     This court would not look kindly on accused
                    persons who forcibly commit both penile and digital rape on young girls. This
                    was not a case of mutual consensual sexual activity between the 13 year old
                    victim and another young boy. The accused, who is ten years older than the
                    victim, was fully aware of the victim’s young age. He persisted with his
                    sexual advances, harassment and sexual attack on the victim at her home despite
                    the very clear rejection of all his sexual advances by the victim. This sexual
                    attack had scarred her emotionally for life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     With the aggravating factors far outweighing
                    the mitigating factors, I accordingly imposed a sentence of 13 years’
                    imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, which in my view was justified in the
                    light of the totality of the circumstances.</p>
