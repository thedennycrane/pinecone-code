He found that the plaintiff had full sight of the documents, knew that she was signing legal documents that created binding legal obligations over significant amounts of money, and indeed signed these documents repeatedly. Although the defendant did not say that the plaintiff had the option of defaulting on the loan if she did not wish to pay the 10% administrative fee repeatedly, this was so obvious that the defendant did not have to say so.

She claimed a sum of $50,874.35 for the pre-amendment loans which fell short of the amount claimed in the SD. The plaintiff further added that this should be added to the 3.92% per month of excess interest paid for Loans 3 to 11 as these loans were less than a month. The AR opined that even adding this purported 3.92% per month of excess interest to the initial sum of $50,874.35, it would still fall far short of the amount claimed in the SD.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I am not convinced by this argument. The pre-amendment loans were either paid in full or were settled by the parties through a valid settlement agreement. In particular, the plaintiff entered into this valid and enforceable settlement agreement voluntarily with the assistance of Adullam. The defendant did not infringe any provision of the MLR 2015 when it imposed the interest charges on the six pre-amendment loans. This is acknowledged by the plaintiff. Hence she cannot now renege on that agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In any event, s 23(1) of the MLA only allows the court to re-open the transaction “[w]hen proceedings are brought in any court by a licensee for the recovery of a loan or the enforcement of a contract for a loan”. The SD does not seek payment of the pre-amendment loans (which the settlement agreement pertains to), but is only for non-payment of the post-amendment Loan 20. Hence, the plaintiff is misconceived that this court can re-open the pre-amendment loans. Accordingly, the pre-amendment loans are not germane to the application to set aside the SD.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Post-amendment loans</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The main issues regarding the post-amendment loans revolve around the refinancing scheme introduced by the defendant in which it imposed a 10% administrative fee for every loan refinancing arrangement. Do these refinancing loans contain excessive interests and are the transactions unconscionable or substantially unfair?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is not disputed that under the law the defendant could impose a 10% administrative fee, 4% per month interest, 4% per month late interest and a $60 late payment fee per month for each loan agreement. It is also not disputed that the defendant had complied with the requirements of the MLA and the MLR 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The court can only re-open the post-amendment loans where the interest is excessive and the transactions are unconscionable or substantially unfair</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the court to re-open the post-amendment loans, the plaintiff has to show that the conditions in s 23 of the MLA are fulfilled.

There are two issues to consider:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the interest charged is excessive; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 These terms, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, excessive, unconscionable and substantially unfair, are not defined under the MLA or the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed). Therefore we have to rely on the plain and simple dictionary meaning of these terms. <span class="font-italic">The Longman Dictionary of the English Language</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>6th Ed<span class="font-italic"> </span> (“the <span class="font-italic">Longman Dictionary</span>”) defines “excessive” as “exceeding the usual, proper, or normal”. Hence, the interest charged has to be above the normal rate of interest. In addition, the transaction must also be “unconscionable or substantially unfair”. Again, the <span class="font-italic">Longman Dictionary</span> defines “unconscionable” as “not guided or controlled by conscience; unscrupulous; excessive, unreasonable; shockingly unfair or unjust”. “Substantial” is further defined as “considerable” or “significant”. Hence, not only must the interest charged be above the norm, but the transaction taken as a whole must <span class="font-italic">also</span> cause an average person to view the loan transaction by the moneylender as unscrupulous or dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Having considered s 23 of the MLA, I shall venture to examine the various post-amendment loan transactions to ascertain whether the court is entitled to re-open the loan transactions in this case. I shall first deal with the issue relating to the 10% administrative fee which the MLR 2015 allows the defendant to charge the borrower on a one-time basis for a loan transaction. This is the largest amount of fee that the defendant could impose. It is even larger than all the other charges combined: the interest of 4% per month, the late interest of 4% per month and the late payment charge of $60 per month.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The purpose of the administrative fee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 What is the purpose of allowing a moneylender to impose a huge 10% administrative fee on the amount of the loan?

</div> explained that the administrative fee would serve to defray some of the costs associated with operating the moneylending business. This included the costs of loan defaults. The Advisory Committee Report at para 30 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30. In respect of the upfront administrative fee, this will serve to defray some of the costs associated with operating the moneylending business. This includes the cost of loan defaults, which are estimated to be around 10% of the total loan principal granted by moneylenders currently. In this regard, the Committee is inclined to set the cap on the administrative fee at 10% of the loan principal. This will create a strong incentive for moneylenders to review their cost structures and to improve the efficiency of their operations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Unlike the interest for the loan, the late interest and the late payment charge which are computed on a per month basis, the administrative fee is a one-time charge for each loan.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant’s administrative fee for loan refinancing under the circumstances is considered an excessive interest </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 MLR 2015 does not prohibit the defendant from charging a 10% administrative fee for a refinancing loan. Does it mean that the defendant can do so? The answer will depend on whether the effects of loan refinancing generate excessive interest for the loans and made the transactions unconscionable or substantially unfair. This means that I have to analyse the 18 loan transactions. Each of these loans, except the first loan (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Loan 3), was the result of loan refinancing. Out of the 17 refinancing loans, three involved an increase in the loan amounts. These were Loan 4, which had a fresh loan of $10,000; Loan 13, which had a fresh loan of $60,000; and Loan 20, where the loan amount was increased by $8,000.

In Loan 3, which was for the sum of $50,000, the defendant imposed all the usual charges and this loan was only for one day. This was the start of the 17 refinancing loans. In normal situations, refinancing is done to benefit the party that seeks it. But in this case, it benefitted the defendant much more than the plaintiff. The defendant imposed a further 10% administrative fee the very next day after it disbursed Loan 3 through the administrative fee for Loan 4. This administrative fee was for the same principal sum (the $50,000 in Loan 3) even though the plaintiff borrowed a further $10,000 in Loan 4. In other words, within the span of just one day, the plaintiff had to pay the defendant a total of 20% in administrative fees. Although the defendant waived the interest (3.92% per month), the late interest (3.92% per month) and the late payment charge ($60 per month), these were relatively small amounts as the aggregate sum was under $1,500.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As explained above, the administrative fee was intended to defray some of the costs associated to the business of moneylending including loan defaults.

But the defendant circumvented this and imposed administrative fees not just once, but <span class="font-italic">more than once per month</span> through the multiple refinancing loans. In other words, the defendant has creatively worked around the provisions governing moneylenders by using the loan refinancing scheme to significantly and unfairly disadvantage the plaintiff who was in financial difficulty and was thus in the defendant’s clutches.

For instance, a one-week loan which is higher than the borrower’s weekly income is clearly not repayable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.2 Such conduct is undesirable and may be regarded as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.2.1  carrying on the business of moneylending in such a manner as to render the licensee unfit to hold a licence, which is a ground for the Registrar to refuse to renew a licence under section 7(1)(d)(v) of the Moneylenders Act; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.2.2  conducting the business of moneylending in an improper manner, which is a ground for the Registrar to revoke or suspend a licence under section 9(1)(a)(iv) of the Moneylenders Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Registrar of Moneylenders (“the Registrar”) had cautioned moneylenders about the effects of loan refinancing on borrowers, in particular the concerns that borrowers might not be able to repay the loans and that repeated charging of administrative fees would penalise the borrowers significantly. Para 1.2 in bold print of RD 2016 reproduced above highlights that moneylenders were offering short-term loans of less than one month in duration which were repeatedly refinanced rather than paying back the principal sum. The refinanced loans are then repeatedly charged the 10% administrative fee. To this, RD 2016 cautioned that licensees should not do so where they know that the borrowers would not be able to pay back the principal or interest at the end of the term of the loan and would need to pay the administrative fee instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In other words, the Registrar was discouraging loan refinancing – such as those conducted by the defendant. But the defendant did not stop despite RD 2016. It merely lengthened the term of the loan to not less than a month – the precise period specified in RD 2016. To illustrate, Loans 3 to 12 all had terms of less than a month. Loan 12 was dated 6 February 2016, mere days after RD 2016 was published on 26 January 2016. Starting from Loan 13, the loan terms were all extended to a month or longer save for Loan 18, which was slightly shorter than a month. In fact, the defendant continued the loan refinancing scheme even when the plaintiff faced difficulties in redeeming her loan. Consequently, the loan burgeoned to a hefty amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 But RD 2016 did not say that such loan refinancing could take place as long as it was a month or longer. In fact, RD 2017 further repeats the warning against loan refinancing. RD 2017 is worded even more strongly than RD 2016 and states at para 2.2.2 that the conduct of moneylenders who practise loan refinancing in order to “reset” the total borrowing cost charged is “tantamount to deliberately circumventing rules 11, 12 and 12A of the [MLR 2015]”.

</div> RD 2017 also clearly disapproves of such practices and states such acts are undesirable. The relevant provisions of RD 2017 read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.2 Licensees should not grant loans or “re-loans” to borrowers to reduce or extinguish an existing debt owed to the same licensee in the knowledge that this serves to “reset” the total borrowing cost charged, as this is tantamount to deliberately circumventing rules 11, 12 and 12A of the Moneylenders Rules. For example, a borrower may end up paying a second administrative fee of 10% on what could be regarded as the same loan principal. Over time, he may also pay an amount in excess of 100% of the principal of the original loan. However, licensees who genuinely wish to assist a borrower through a loan restructuring may do so as long as there is no circumvention of the Moneylenders Rules.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.3 Such acts are undesirable and may be regarded as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.3.1 carrying on the business of moneylending in such a manner as to render the licensee unfit to hold a licence, which is a ground for the Registrar to refuse to renew a licence under section 7(1)(d)(v) of the Moneylenders Act; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.3.2 conducting the business of moneylending in an improper manner, which is a ground for the Registrar to revoke or suspend a licence under section 9(1)(a)(iv) of the Moneylenders Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loan refinancing with administrative fees was not foreseen by Parliament</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This 10% administrative fee constituted the largest payment towards the repayment of the loans. It is clear that Parliament did not intend to allow the defendant to unjustly enrich itself through the imposition of such fee on the same principal sum, as in the case of the refinancing loan scheme. The main purpose for the introduction of the MLR 2015, which took on board many of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, was expressed in a press release dated 18 June 2014 by the Ministry of Law when it formed the Advisory Committee. The press release stated that the Advisory Committee was formed to review and recommend measures on:

But the MLR 2015 did not directly address loan refinancing schemes. This is why RD 2016 and RD 2017 had to clarify what the MLR 2015 means for such schemes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In this case, the loan refinancing scheme here is egregious and substantially unfair to the plaintiff. The obvious example is Loan 1 which was only for a day. Of course, there may be instances where moneylenders genuinely wish to assist a borrower by using loan restructuring. This is acknowledged in RD 2017 (at para 2.2.2) and also by the plaintiff, as she takes no issue with the imposition of administrative fees for fresh loans. The question is whether the loans in this case are fresh loans, and I find that they are not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Administrative fee in loan refinancing is not a “permitted fee” under s 2 of the MLA</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Hence, in situations of loan refinancing where the moneylender does not provide fresh funds but still charges the same 10% administrative fee, I am of the view that this administrative fee cannot be considered a “permitted fee” under s 2 of the MLA as there is nothing afresh for the moneylender to administer. The purpose of the fee was to entice the plaintiff to continue paying a relatively smaller amount than what she would have had to pay, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the principal, if the defendant called on the entire owed sum outright. In substance, the 10% administrative fee is a form of additional interest that comes within the definition of “interest” under s 2 of the MLA, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“interest”, in relation to a loan, means <span class="font-weight-bold">any amount by whatsoever name called in excess of the principal paid</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>or payable to a moneylender in consideration of or otherwise <span class="font-weight-bold">in respect of the loan</span>, but does not include any permitted fee, stamp duty or other fee payable under this Act or any other written law; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The defendant’s administrative fee also infringes r 12A of the MLR 2015</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Rule 12A of the MLR 2015 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the licensee must not recover from a borrower, on account of interest, late interest or any fee permitted under rule 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), an aggregate amount exceeding the principal of the loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The overall aggregate of the actual funds, less loan refinancing, provided to the plaintiff from the 18 loans was $128,000. But the plaintiff had paid a total of $195,844.60 in administrative fees, interest and a late fee, which is more than the principal sum. This is in breach of r 12A of the MLR 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Even though the plaintiff has paid more than the amount disbursed, the defendant is still not satisfied with the amount of $195,884.60 paid by the plaintiff thus far. The defendant is further claiming an amount of $135,879.96, which is the sum claimed in the SD. The total combined sum is $195,884.60 + $135,879.96 = $331,764.56. If the defendant’s claim succeeds, then the plaintiff will be paying more than double the amount of the principal sum of $128,000. This far exceeds the amount the defendant is allowed to claim under r 12A of the MLR 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 From this analysis, the loan refinancing is indeed very excessive to the plaintiff. It is true that the plaintiff might not have been forced to enter into the loan refinancing for 17 times after Loan 3, as she would have realised the substantial disadvantages or the adverse consequences of the loan refinancing arrangements to her. It is also true that the plaintiff is a director of several companies and is not a naïve babe in the woods. But she was in a financial quagmire once she was caught by the temptation of easy money and took out the loans from the defendant. She could not easily free herself from the unretractable clutches of the defendant. She had to give in to the demands of the defendant for loan refinancing whenever the loan matured as she did not have the financial means to redeem her loan. If she did not give in to the defendant and pay the 10% administrative fee each time the loan matured, she would have to face the possible consequences of the defendant calling upon the entire loan and possible bankruptcy was real. She could ill afford such consequences as her directorship would have been in jeopardy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The post-amendment loan transactions are also unconscionable and substantially unfair</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The 18 loans are documented as separate contracts. Examining them separately, one might well conclude that they had complied with the MLA and the MLR 2015. While these loans aggregate $1,558,000 on paper, the amount that the defendant actually advanced to the plaintiff was only $128,000. But the defendant imposed charges on the plaintiff based on $1,558,000 rather than $128,000!</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 To ascertain whether these transactions taken as a whole are unconscionable or substantially unfair, I directed the parties to address the issue of whether the court could go behind the purported veil of legality of these loan agreements. This issue was not raised in their submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In <span class="font-italic">EC Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another (Orion Oil Limited and another, Interveners) </span>[2011] 2 SLR 232, the court looked past the legality of the documents to ascertain the true nature and purport of the parties. Although the documents painted a picture of the sale of a piece of property, the court found that what the parties truly intended was a loan agreement with security. In so doing, the court said (at [77]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">It is clear law that the court is entitled to go behind whatever labels that parties chose to put on their transactions, to ascertain their true nature and purport.</span> It is a matter of substance over form and labels: see Kim Lewinson, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2007) at para 9.07, cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">MCST Plan No 1933</span> <span class="font-italic">v Liang Huat Aluminium Ltd </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 91 (“<span class="font-italic">Liang Huat</span>”) at [46] and <span class="font-italic">Welsh Development Agency v Export Finance Co Ltd</span> [1992] BCLC 148. The true nature and purport of these two documents show a clear loan amount of $1.5m (negotiated down from $2m after AA, not the 1st Defendant, was said to be a credit risk due to the many actions against him) and called an “option fee”, the loan period was 60 days and there was a hefty interest of $180,000 labelled as “compensation”, which amounted to 6% per month or 72% per annum and it was secured on the Property. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In other words, we should not miss the woods for the trees. Rather than myopically focusing on the individual refinanced loans, the court must cast its eyes on the broader implication of the 18 loans to ascertain whether there was excessive interest, by whatever label it might have been named, and whether these transactions were unconscionable or substantially unfair. And here, there seems to be an absence of substantial fair play. I shall now elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) There is a stark difference in the plaintiff’s liability between loan refinancing and no loan refinancing</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At my request, the parties tendered two agreed tables to the court, to show two scenarios in relation to Loans 3 to 20. The first table, Table A, shows the plaintiff’s liability with the refinanced loans. The second table, Table B, shows the situation the plaintiff would have been in without the refinanced loans. The differences on the payment of charges and fees are very stark. The plaintiff paid a total amount of $195,844.60 with the loan refinancing, but would only pay $92,182.16 – less than half – without such a scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This loan refinancing scheme clearly triggers the presumption under s 23(6) of the MLA because what is in substance an interest payment of about 10% was levied on every refinanced loan, albeit under the guise of an administrative charge. Section 23(6) of the MLA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where in any proceedings in court referred to in subsection (1) or where proof of debt has been filed as referred to in subsection (5), it is found that the interest or late interest charged on any loan exceeds such maximum rate of interest or late interest as may be prescribed for the loan, the court or the Official Assignee, as the case may be, shall presume for the purposes of this section, unless the contrary is proved, that the interest or late interest charged in respect of the loan is excessive and that the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Unlike genuine instances of loan restructuring, it is not entirely accurate to describe such activities as loan refinancing because essentially, the loan sums remain largely the same and the plaintiff paid the 10% administrative fee periodically. The charges were also basically the same, although in certain loan transactions the defendant waived some of these charges, like the interests and the late payment fee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) There was no loan refinancing for the six pre-amendment loans</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is also pertinent to note that the defendant did not refinance the plaintiff’s loans for the six pre-amendment loans even when she encountered difficulty in the repayment of Loan 1. She had to seek the assistance of Adullam to resolve the loan repayment with the defendant. Eventually, the repayment plan resulted in a settlement agreement with the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It was obvious why there was no loan refinancing for the pre-amendment loans. The MLR at that time did not allow the defendant to charge the 10% administrative fee which was only permissible under the post-amendment MLR 2015 which came into force on 1 October 2015. The defendant submits that it is operating a business and it should be able to conduct a viable business for profit within the legal framework. I agree that moneylenders should be allowed to strive to profit within the boundaries of the law. There should be a right balance between the interests of the borrower and the lender. Indeed, this was stated by Ms Indranee Rajah in the relevant Parliamentary Debates (<span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 March 2014) vol 91 (Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Education and Law)):
