The plaintiff, who had sold the cargo of PME to the customer, claims that it was still the owner of the PME when it was disposed of by the defendant, the storage company.  This disposal was alleged to be in breach of the plaintiff’s right to possession of the PME cargo as its owner.  It has thus brought this action for damages.  The defendant, on the other hand, insists that it was simply asserting its rights under its contract with its customer, which provided for the defendant to have a contractual lien to retain and dispose of the PME, and apply the sale proceeds in discharge of the outstanding liabilities owed to it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is a private company incorporated in Singapore which specialises in the trading of oil and gas products.

NFPL owned and operated a biodiesel manufacturing facility at 2 Banyan Place, Jurong Island, Singapore 627700 (“2 Banyan Place”) which is adjacent to the Banyan Terminal.

Under cl 20, the defendant was to have a right of lien and retention over IBRIS’s products stored at the Banyan Terminal in the event that the security provided by IBRIS was either insufficient or invalid.  Flowing from this, cl 22 provided for the defendant to have a right of disposal over IBRIS’s products.  This would allow the defendant to sell the stored products and use the sale proceeds to pay off any outstanding liabilities due to it.  Lastly, pursuant to cl 39, IBRIS was required to provide two bank guarantees to the defendant.  The first guarantee was to be provided before 1 August 2011 for the period from 1 August 2011 until 31 July 2012 for a sum of S$4,960,000.  The second guarantee of S$5,625,000 was to be provided before 1 July 2012 for the period from 1 August 2012 until the expiration or termination of the Service Agreement.  The relevant portions of these three clauses I have referred to are set out below:

The plaintiff was aware that a longer period of delivery would prolong its exposure to the risk of IBRIS failing to pay.  These concerns were fuelled by the fact that the plaintiff had received indications from Mr Choong that IBRIS might have difficulty paying for the PME cargo.

</div>
</div>  This conversion claim is premised on the plaintiff having title to the PME cargo at the material time.  It was the plaintiff’s and IBRIS’s intention that title to the PME cargo would only pass upon complete delivery of the PME, and this was when the last batch was delivered on 17 October 2014.  Before that happened, the parties also entered into the Storage Agreement to ensure that title remained with the plaintiff, or was returned to it, pending payment for the entire cargo by IBRIS.  Given that IBRIS had no title over the PME cargo, the defendant had no right to deal with the PME cargo without the plaintiff’s consent.  The defendant was put on notice of the plaintiff’s position as to its title by January 2015 at the latest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiff contends that, if the defendant had a valid possessory lien capable of potentially encumbering the plaintiff’s interest in the PME cargo, the right of lien did not arise until after 29 November 2014.  This was well after the execution of the Storage Agreement on 15 October 2014, which the plaintiff alleges was the latest possible date when title to the PME cargo was returned to the plaintiff, assuming that title to the PME cargo had already passed before then through the delivery of each of batch of PME.  Once it is clear that title to the PME cargo remained with the plaintiff, it is argued that the defendant could not exercise its lien over the cargo.  In short, the defendant’s lien is exercisable only over stored products which were owned by IBRIS.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The plaintiff denies the assertions made by the defendant that IBRIS was conferred with implied authority or had apparent authority to store the PME cargo in Tank 1102 on the plaintiff’s behalf, thereby making the PME cargo subject to the defendant’s lien even though the plaintiff still held title to it.  The plaintiff was not privy to IBRIS’s arrangements with the defendant.  It only became aware of the defendant’s contractual right of lien in March 2015 when the defendant refused to deliver up the cargo despite the plaintiff’s demand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff also argues that the defendant did not validly exercise its lien before 15 October 2014 because it never gave proper written notice to IBRIS of its intended exercise of the lien.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In response to the defendant’s counterclaim for storage fees and other ancillary costs (as explained below), the plaintiff concedes that it would be required to pay “reasonable storage fees” from 1 October 2014 to 16 February 2015, the date on which the plaintiff demanded the return of the PME cargo (see above at [28]).  It disputes the quantum of fees claimed by the defendant as being exorbitant and argues that any damages payable should be limited to S$147,284.26.

The PME cargo was delivered to the Banyan Terminal in batches.  According to the defendant, title passed to IBRIS when each batch was delivered on the basis of the PME being unconditionally appropriated, with the assent of the plaintiff and IBRIS, to the Sale and Purchase Agreement.  The Storage Agreement did not have the effect of returning title to the plaintiff because, on its proper interpretation, cl 8 is only a retention of title clause that cannot operate retrospectively.  Consequently, title to the delivered PME cargo had passed to IBRIS and the PME cargo became subject to the terms of the Service Agreement, in particular, the defendant’s right of lien and right of disposal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Indeed, the defendant argues that this would have been the case <span class="font-italic">even </span><span class="font-italic">if </span>the effect of the Storage Agreement was to return title to the plaintiff.

</div>  The defendant was still entitled to exert possessory control because there had been an insufficiency of security which triggered its right of lien.  The defendant argues that its right to exercise its contractual lien arose when IBRIS failed to provide BG2 by 29 May 2014 and by the subsequent extended deadlines.  This is because the failure to provide BG2 meant that the defendant had insufficient security as per the terms of the Service Agreement.  The defendant argues that it validly exercised its contractual lien over the PME cargo in September 2014 before the Storage Agreement was entered into.  A secondary justification advanced by the defendant is that IBRIS had been granted authority from the plaintiff to store the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal.  The plaintiff knew that the stored cargo at the defendant’s premises would have been subject to certain terms and conditions such as a right of lien.  It cannot therefore now claim to be ignorant of them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 By way of counterclaim, the defendant seeks to recover from the plaintiff the outstanding storage fees for the PME cargo from 1 October 2014 until the time of its disposition, 6 June 2015.  In the alternative, the defendant says that it is minimally owed storage fees up to 16 February 2015.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It is necessary for me to analyse the plaintiff’s case a little more carefully in order to determine exactly the key issues I must decide.  There are also other peripheral issues that have been raised and argued at length by both parties in their written closing submissions, such as whether the plaintiff is estopped from bringing these proceedings against the defendant because it had failed to bring a claim in the course of Originating Summons No 100 of 2015 (IBRIS’s application for leave to convene a creditors’ meeting pursuant to s 210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)) to determine whether the plaintiff or IBRIS had title to the PME cargo, despite leave being granted by the court for the plaintiff to do so.  In my view, these are not essential issues to the determination of the dispute.  In any event, I find the defendant’s arguments on this point to be a non-starter, since the claim brought by the plaintiff against the defendant in these proceedings is quite distinct from any rights that the plaintiff can assert against IBRIS and furthermore, there was no legal compulsion for the plaintiff to have brought up the issue of title to the PME cargo only in proceedings against IBRIS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Coming back to the crux of the dispute, I find that the plaintiff’s case that its property has been converted is founded on several planks.  As mentioned, the first and fundamental point is that title to the PME cargo continued to be held by the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">before</span> the defendant exercised its contractual lien.  Hence, the plaintiff argues that title never passed when the batches of PME were delivered to IBRIS and transferred to Tank 1102 at the Banyan Terminal.  Alternatively, even if title to the PME had passed, the Storage Agreement executed on 15 October 2014 had the effect of transferring title from IBRIS back to the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 That the plaintiff held title to the PME cargo is the entire foundation to the plaintiff’s case.  The plaintiff accepts that, if it fails to cross this first hurdle, its entire case of conversion and/or interference with its property rights by the defendant would collapse, and its claim will be dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Next, according to the plaintiff’s case, if the Storage Agreement had the effect of returning title to the PME to the plaintiff, it must go on to show that the defendant did not exercise its contractual lien until <span class="font-italic">after</span> 15 October 2014, the date the Storage Agreement was made.  This is premised on the assumption that the defendant cannot exercise its lien over any products stored in its tanks, if the products are owned by someone other than the defendant’s customer.  The validity of this assumption in the context of this case will have to be explored later in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The next plank of the plaintiff’s case is that the defendant could not have exercised its lien until the time the Service Agreement was terminated, that is, 29 November 2014, because that was when the liabilities of IBRIS to the defendant exceeded the value that remained in BG1.  That was when the security became insufficient.  Alternatively, even if the defendant could have exercised its lien prior to 15 October 2014, it did not validly do so because of its failure to give IBRIS prior written notice of its intention to exercise its lien.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Thus, from the above, the issues I have to decide may be divided into two broad areas.  The first area concerns the question of title to the PME cargo. Two questions must be answered - did title to the PME cargo pass from the plaintiff to IBRIS and if so, when?  If title passed, what was the effect of the Storage Agreement? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The second area deals with the defendant’s contractual right of lien and the consequences flowing thereon.  The questions in this area I have to deal with are: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) At what point could the defendant have exercised its right of lien?  When did it exercise its right of lien?  Was it obliged to give notice of the exercise of its right of lien? </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) At the time when the defendant exercised its lien, would it have made a difference if the title to the PME cargo was with IBRIS or the plaintiff? </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I shall examine these two broad areas in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Right of possession to the PME cargo </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did title to the PME cargo pass to IBRIS?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I deal first with whether the plaintiff had title to the PME cargo.  My finding on this point will affect much of the subsequent analysis in this judgment.  The initial question which must be addressed is whether and, if so, when title to the PME cargo passed from the plaintiff to IBRIS.  The terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement are of limited assistance because they do not specify when title was to pass.  The PORAM terms and conditions governing the Sale and Purchase Agreement are silent on this issue.

</div>  Where a written contract does not expressly provide for the transfer of title, the general rules as to the passing of title under the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “SOGA”) will apply and it is to this that I now turn.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 If the contract is for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, property is transferred when it is so intended by the parties (s 17(1) SOGA).  In determining the parties’ intention, the court may have regard to the contractual terms, the parties’ conduct and the circumstances of the case (s 17(2) SOGA).  Supplementing this, s 18 of the SOGA sets out the default rules for the passing of title.  At the outset, I should highlight that the Sale and Purchase Agreement was a contract to sell unascertained goods.  The parties are in agreement on this.   The authors of <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’</span><span class="font-italic">s Sale of Goods </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2017) at para [5-060]<span class="font-italic"> </span>identify three categories of goods which usually fall within this description:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first is that of generic goods, that is to say, of a certain quantity of goods in general, without any specific identification of them, such as “50 hogsheads of sugar”.

The buyer had paid the contract price and the seller had made preparations for shipment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by packing and labelling the goods).  However, before the goods were shipped, the seller company was wound up.  The buyer argued that the goods had been appropriated to the contract and property had passed.  Hence, the goods did not fall within the pool of the company’s assets available for distribution to its creditors.  Pearson J examined the language of s 18 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (c 71) (UK), which mirrors the SOGA, and found that for property to pass, three conditions have to be satisfied: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The goods must be unconditionally appropriated.  The parties “must have had or be reasonably supposed to have had, an intention to attach the contract irrevocably to those goods”.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) There must be assent.

This can be either actual or constructive delivery. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I pause briefly to note that, although the Court characterised these as three separate conditions, the requirement of delivery is better conceptualised as being subsumed under appropriation.

The Court determined that the parties’ intention was that title would only pass upon shipment.

</div>  It follows that the PME could not have been unconditionally appropriated, and hence passing title to IBRIS, before full delivery took place.  At the earliest, title to the PME cargo would only have passed on 17 October 2014, when delivery of all 2,000 metric tonnes of PME was completed.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiff raises two points in advancing its argument.  First, the Sale and Purchase Agreement specified that the PME cargo was to be delivered on a “FOB ITT” basis.  “FOB” and “ITT” are terms found under Incoterms 2010: International Chamber of Commerce rules for the use of domestic and international trade terms (“Incoterms”).  They have specific definitions which, according to the plaintiff, indicate when the parties intended delivery to be effected.  The plaintiff relies on the definitions offered in the report of its expert, Mr Mario Johan Nurtanio (“Mr Nurtanio”).
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-1e9a29d5-146f-4f8b-b789-034e75623ca4" data-toggle="modal" type="button">84</button></sup>

</div>  He is an experienced trader in biodiesel, in particular, PME.  He is also a member of the Commercial and Technical Committee of the PORAM and the Executive Committee of the Malaysian Biodiesel Association.  Mr Nurtanio considered “FOB”, or “free on board”, to mean that the seller is only responsible for the goods until they are loaded onto the transportation used for the transaction.  “ITT” refers to “in-tank transfer” which means that “the seller will ensure the delivery of the cargo into a tank nominated for the transaction.”  He went on to observe that if “delivered in batches, the cargo is only considered delivered when the entirety … is delivered”.  This interpretation is also supported by the evidence of Ms Lim and Mr Choong, the plaintiff’s and IBRIS’ representatives.

</div>
</div>  So, the plaintiff argues that it was clearly the contracting parties’ intention that the inclusion of the term “ITT” was to have the effect of delivery only taking place after actual full delivery of all 2,000 metric tonnes of PME.  It adds that the defendant has not substantially challenged its evidence on this point.

It says that such a term can only mean that delivery was intended to take place after the entire contractual quantity had been delivered.  To suggest otherwise would mean that there would have been 67 potential “start dates” from which the 30 day credit period would run from.

</div>  The PME may have been physically delivered to the Banyan Terminal but this would not have been regarded as delivery for the purpose of appropriating the cargo.  Appropriation would only have occurred upon acceptance, on confirmation that the PME was in accordance with the required specifications.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In contrast, the defendant argues that there was unconditional appropriation and assent upon the delivery of each truckload of PME.  Title would have passed upon each delivery.  Referencing the language of s 18 r 5(2), the defendant asserts that each delivery by the plaintiff to 2 Banyan Place amounted to a delivery of PME “for the purpose of transmission to the buyer”.  There was an irrevocable attachment of each batch of PME cargo to the contract because the PME was received by IBRIS and was then pumped into Tank 1102, with knowledge of the plaintiff that this was being done.  The wording of the Sale and Purchase Agreement did not include a reservation as to the plaintiff’s right of disposal for the batches of PME delivered.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The parties’ objective conduct also shows that delivery was intended to take place upon the arrival of each PME batch.

</div>  In this email, Ms Lim expressed the need for the plaintiff and IBRIS to enter into the Storage Agreement because of the delayed delivery timeline.  She requested for an “agreement for the fuels delivered to [IBRIS] tanks and have [IBRIS] return title of the goods delivered to date to [the plaintiff]”, which eventually became the Storage Agreement.  It was initially Ms Lim’s evidence that this choice of wording was intended to disabuse IBRIS of the belief that title had passed from the plaintiff.

These deliveries of PME were then pumped into Tank 1102, which was for the IBRIS’s exclusive use.  As can be seen by the terms of the Storage Agreement, the plaintiff was well aware that the PME was being stored in Tank 1102.  In my judgment, this demonstrates an intention to attach those specific quantities of PME to the Sale and Purchase Agreement.  The plaintiff did not withhold any documentation, which would have qualified IBRIS’s possession of the goods.  The steps taken by the plaintiff in delivering the PME were irrevocable.  In fact, IBRIS was free to sell the PME cargo to BP, as it had intended, and move the PME cargo out of Tank 1102 immediately for that purpose.  This is quite unlike the seller in <span class="font-italic">Carlos </span><span class="font-italic">Federspiel</span> who still had the option to refuse to ship the goods to the buyer.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I accept the defendant’s submissions that the parties’ conduct indicates that they assented to the appropriation of the PME cargo upon each delivery.

In her oral evidence, Ms Lim characterised this as an attempt to obtain a goodwill payment from IBRIS and to reduce the plaintiff’s exposure.

</div>  Nonetheless, it is notable that this attempt to collect payment was not met with any protest by IBRIS.  The issuance of an invoice is not reflective of a casual attempt at getting paid.  Faced with unforeseen delays in delivery and IBRIS’s cash flow issues, the plaintiff’s behaviour reflects that of a nervous seller trying to avert potential losses by seeking payment as early as possible.  The plaintiff would only have taken such steps if it was of the belief that it could no longer assert title over the delivered PME cargo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The terms “FOB” and “ITT” do not make it clear that appropriation would only occur upon delivery of the full contractual amount of 2,000 metric tonnes of PME.  These terms do not relate to when title passes but only address the method and means of delivery.  Similarly, the requirement for IBRIS to make payment 30 days after delivery does not definitively support the plaintiff’s case.  A distinction should be drawn between delivery for the purpose of calculating the date of payment to determine a fixed starting point from which IBRIS’s credit term would run, and delivery for the purpose of appropriating the goods to the contract.  The latter simply requires a transmission of the goods to the buyer, without any reservation of any right of disposal by the seller.  This could have occurred without triggering IBRIS’s payment obligations, which I find was 30 days after the full completion of the full delivery of the PME cargo, based on the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I also agree with the defendant that the expressions of the parties’ subjective intentions are of limited assistance in determining when title was to pass.  Although Ms Lim and Mr Choong were responsible for negotiating the Sale and Purchase Agreement and would have been privy to the intentions of their companies, it is the objective evidence in the form of communications that passed between the plaintiff and IBRIS that are relevant.  Further, their evidence was premised on their general understanding as commodity traders in the market.  A useful illustration of this is the distinction drawn by Mr Choong between “delivery” and “acceptance”.  This is not a legal distinction found under s 18 of the SOGA.  Moreover, taking into account the concessions made by Ms Lim in relation to her 8 October 2014 email to Mr Choong and what I find is the significance of the term “ITT”, it is uncertain whether her views actually accurately reflect the plaintiff’s position at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of the Storage Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Given my finding that title to the PME passed to IBRIS upon each delivery, the next issue is whether the Storage Agreement successfully passed title back to the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The plaintiff argues that cl 8 of the Storage Agreement (see [19] above) has a two-fold purpose.

</div>  Title was to remain with the plaintiff even after the completion of delivery on 17 October 2014.  I have already found that title passed upon each delivery of the PME cargo.  As such, this argument is only relevant in respect of the PME which was undelivered at the date of the Storage Agreement’s execution.  Secondly, if title passed to IBRIS upon each delivery, it was the intention of the parties to use cl 8 as a means to transfer title to the delivered PME back to the plaintiff.

</div>  It is contended that the plain words of cl 8 support such an interpretation.  The plaintiff also relies on emails sent between the parties on 8 October 2014 to illustrate that this was the parties’ intention.  Besides the email sent from Ms Lim to Mr Choong (see above at [55]), the plaintiff also refers to correspondence from the plaintiff’s Ms Mabel Loh (“Ms Loh”) to Mr Choong which stated that title “shall not pass to [IBRIS] until all debts owed to [the plaintiff] by [IBRIS] are fully paid and settled”.

</div>  So, it was argued that the objective of the parties was clearly that title to the PME cargo would remain with the plaintiff at all times, but if title passed, the Storage Agreement would have had the effect of returning title to achieve this desired outcome.  In the alternative, the plaintiff submits that the emails sent by Ms Loh and Ms Lim on 8 October 2014 and Mr Choong’s response to both emails, appearing to accept the terms set out therein, constitute a valid and binding agreement to return title to the PME to the plaintiff.

</div>  This is because cl 8 only purports to retain title and does not address the re-conveyance of title back to the plaintiff.  The defendant argues that adopting the plaintiff’s position would be tantamount to rewriting the terms of the Storage Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The law on the interpretation of contractual terms is not controversial.  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen</span> [2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”) at [30] summarised the principles expressed in <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd) </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span>”) [2015] 5 SLR 1187 on contractual interpretation.  The Court of Appeal explained that the purpose of interpretation is to give effect to the objectively ascertained expressed intentions of the contracting parties as it emerges from the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language.  While both the text of the agreement and the surrounding context must be considered, the written agreement is of first and primary importance.  Extrinsic evidence is admissible so long as it is “relevant”, “reasonably available to all the contracting parties” and relates to a “clear or obvious context” (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich</span> <span class="font-italic">Insurance</span>”) at [125], [132]).  Such evidence must go towards proving<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>what the parties <span class="font-italic">objectively</span> agreed upon (<span class="font-italic">Zurich</span> <span class="font-italic">Insurance</span> at [132(d)]).  Evidence of the subjective intentions of the parties is not relevant (<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [30] and <span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span> at [33]).  An exception to this is where there is latent ambiguity in the written agreement (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my judgment, the wording of cl 8 is clear.  It directed that title and property to the PME “shall not pass” until the IBRIS settled its debts.  The plain and ordinary reading of this is that the plaintiff was to retain title to the PME cargo which had not already passed to IBRIS as of 15 October 2014.  There is nothing to suggest that the phrase “shall not pass”, which is drafted in the future tense, should also apply to title to the PME cargo which has already passed to IBRIS.  The plaintiff’s contended interpretation grants cl 8 a retroactive effect which cannot be discerned from the clause’s wording.  If the plaintiff’s intention had been to use the Storage Agreement as a means by which to also re-convey title, this could easily have been expressed in the language of the Storage Agreement. The fact that this was not done strengthens the conclusion that cl 8 was not intended to have such an expansive meaning. Ms Lim, the plaintiff’s representative, appreciated the distinction between the “return” of title and for title to “remain”

</div> and reflected this in her email correspondence to IBRIS which was a precursor to the Storage Agreement.  Why then was this distinction not captured in the wording of the Storage Agreement itself?   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In any event, I find that the emails sent on 8 October 2014 are not relevant for the purposes of interpreting the scope of cl 8.  These emails point to the <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> intentions of the plaintiff and IBRIS.  The background context of the parties’ discussions should not be used to create ambiguity as to the meaning of the Storage Agreement where none exists (<span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span> at [32]).  I also do not accept that these emails amounted to a binding agreement.  If an earlier agreement had been concluded on 8 October 2014, with terms as to the return of title being clearly articulated, there would have been no purpose in executing the Storage Agreement.  The fact that the plaintiff and IBRIS concluded the Storage Agreement suggests that they intended for it to govern their contractual relationship.  I should also add that the plaintiff has not pleaded the existence of an agreement concluded by way of the 8 October 2014 emails.

</div>
</div>  I will make two observations here.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, I find that the plaintiff and IBRIS must have been trying to create a misleading impression to third parties, such as the defendant, that the Storage Agreement backdated to 1 September 2014 governed their relationship <span class="font-italic">from the beginning</span>.  Hence, cl 8 refers to the whole of the PME cargo as if no part of it had already been delivered.  Also, the plaintiff later sent the Storage Agreement to the defendant claiming that it was the basis of its right to ownership and possession over the entire PME cargo, without explaining that it has been signed at a time when almost all of the PME cargo has been delivered into Tank 1102 (see above at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Second,  if it was clear to the parties that title to the PME cargo would only pass upon complete delivery, there would have been no need to backdate the Storage Agreement.  The backdating of the Storage Agreement suggests that the parties knew, or at least believed, that title to the delivered PME had already passed, and they were attempting to re-write history.  The decision of the plaintiff to enter into the Storage Agreement suggests to me that the plaintiff was seeking a way by which it could create an interest over the PME cargo to secure payment of what was due by IBRIS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Bearing this in mind, it becomes clear that the plaintiff wanted the best of both worlds.  It knew that title to each batch of PME cargo passed upon delivery to IBRIS.  This presented a problem since IBRIS was clearly in financial difficulty.  To protect its interests, the plaintiff sought to reclaim title to the delivered PME by way of the Storage Agreement but without conceding that title to the delivered PME had already passed.  By backdating the Storage Agreement, the plaintiff attempted to create a fiction that this arrangement operated over the whole PME cargo.  This explains why cl 8 is drafted as it was, that is, to simply retain title.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my judgment, cl 8 has the effect of a retention of title clause.  The scope of cl 8 does not provide for the return of title, which already passed to IBRIS, back to the plaintiff.  The Storage Agreement only had the effect of ensuring that the plaintiff retained title to the undelivered PME as at 15 October 2014, which was the last batch of 21.30 metric tonnes that was delivered on 17 October 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Given my findings as to when title to the PME cargo passed, the plaintiff accepts that its case that the defendant has converted its property or wrongfully interfered with its property rights in respect of the PME cargo, which title had already passed to IBRIS by 15 October 2014, will necessarily fail.

</div>  A general possessory lien refers to a right to “retain possession of goods or documents belonging to another until all claims against that other are satisfied” (Alfred H Silvertown, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Lien</span> (Butterworths, 1st Ed, 1988)) at p 19.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The lien under cl 20 creates an interest in favour of the defendant that is not the same as that in <span class="font-italic">Diablo Fortune </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Duncan, Cameron Lindsay</span> [2018] 2 SLR 129 (“<span class="font-italic">Diablo</span>”).  There, the Court of Appeal considered the nature of a contractual lien over sub-freights.  The appellant, (“the Owner”), owned a vessel which it chartered out to a company (“the Company”).  Cl 18 of the bareboat charter provided the Owner with a lien as follows (at [10]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … [the Owner] to have a lien upon all cargoes, sub-hires and sub-freights belonging or due to [the Company] or any sub-charterers and any Bill of Lading freight for all claims under this Charter, and [the Company] to have a lien on the Vessel for all moneys paid in advance and not earned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Company went on to sub-charter the vessel.  Sometime later, the Company incurred substantial losses and its directors filed a winding up application.  Upon being notified of this, the Owner sought to exercise, pursuant to cl 18, a lien on the sub-freights due from the sub-charterer to the Company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Court of Appeal observed that it is a well-established position in English law that liens on sub-freights give rise to an “equitable assignment by way of floating charge” (at [35]).  Such liens assign future choses in action and the ship-owner has a dormant right to the sub-freights when they come into existence.  The shipowner holds no proprietary interest “until sums due under the charter go unpaid” (at [37]).  The Court of Appeal endorsed the definition of a floating charge (at [38]) as set out in <span class="font-italic">In re Yorkshire </span><span class="font-italic">Woolcombers Association Ltd</span> [1903] 2 Ch 284 at 295: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) it is a charge on a class of present and future assets of a company; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) this class of assets would, in the ordinary course of business, “be changing from time to time”; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) until a future step is taken by those interested in the charge, the company may carry on business in the ordinary way.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In determining whether rights conferred should be characterised as floating charges, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Diablo </span>articulated a two-step approach.  First, identify the rights conferred under the security and second, determine the appropriate legal characterisation of these rights (at [57]).  The court should place emphasis on the substance of the security, rather than the form.  A floating charge may be created without express reference to the expressions “present or future property” or “undertaking” (citing <span class="font-italic">Re Lin Securities (Pte) Ltd; Chi Man </span><span class="font-italic">Kwong Peter and others v Asia Commercial Bank and others</span> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 220 at [24]).  On the facts, the Court of Appeal accepted that cl 18 created a floating charge (at [58]).  The equitable assignment of security under cl 18 was not absolute and the Company was free to deal with the sub-freights for its own business operations prior to the Owner giving notice of its exercise of the lien.  Since the lien had not been registered, it was void against the Company’s liquidators and creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In this case, cl 20 simply provides for a right of lien and retention over products stored by IBRIS with the defendant.  This is complemented by the right of disposal under cl 22.  In contrast with the case of <span class="font-italic">Diablo</span>, cl 20 contemplates the defendant exercising its rights of control over products already <span class="font-italic">in its possession</span>.  Unlike a floating charge, the defendant would not be able to exercise its security interest over the products unless they were already stored in the tanks at the Banyan Terminal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The nature of the defendant’s interest is more akin to the lien in <span class="font-italic">Great Eastern Railway Company v Lord’s Trustee</span> [1909] AC 109 (“<span class="font-italic">Great Eastern Railway</span>”).  That case involved a coal merchant (“Lord”) who opened a credit account with a railway company by way of a “ledger agreement” for the carriage of his coal.  The relevant clause of the ledger agreement provided the railway company with: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…a continual lien upon all waggons, goods, minerals, articles and <span class="font-italic">things hauled or conveyed on their lines</span>, or which shall be at any time upon the railway or <span class="font-italic">upon any ground allotted by or rented of the company</span> for all tolls, rates, charges and moneys which shall be or become due or payable to the company…and the company to be at liberty from time to time and in such manner as they shall think fit, to sell and dispose of all or any of such waggons, goods, minerals, articles and things in order to satisfy any such lien. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Lord fell into arrears and the railway company closed the credit account.  It also shut the gates of its yard, preventing Lord from removing coal on his allotments.  The dispute before the House of Lords concerned the nature of the railway company’s interest.  The railway company argued that the ledger agreement was not void for registration as a bill of sale; its interest “was not an equitable right to take possession, but a common law right to <span class="font-italic">retain a possession</span> with which they had never parted” [emphasis added] (at 111).  The House of Lords agreed.  There was already possession at law and the ledger agreement merely gave the railway company a right to retain, coupled with an authority to sell, the coal in its yard (at 113, 115).  It was inconsequential that Lord had previously been able to enter the yard and freely remove coal (at 112).  While Lord may have retained possession in one sense, the railway company’s right to the coal was not dormant (unlike the Owner’s right to sub-freights in <span class="font-italic">Diablo</span>).  Its lien was operative over the coal so long as it remained in the yard (at 115).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Similarly, in our case, the PME cargo was subject to the defendant’s right of lien only while stored at the Banyan Terminal and in its possession.  While IBRIS remained free to move the PME cargo out of Tank 1102 in the ordinary course of business, the lien could be exercised by the defendant when the contractually agreed conditions were triggered.  This differentiates the defendant’s interest from a floating charge which creates a security interest in favour of the chargee over assets that may not even be in its possession, and which some step has to be taken to crystallise the chargee’s proprietary interest in or possessory right over the charged assets.  In my view, a possessory lien is conceptually quite distinct from a security interest created by a floating charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 With these observations in mind, I move on now to consider the defendant’s purported exercise of the lien.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When could the defendant have exercised its right of lien?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On the plaintiff’s case, the date on which the defendant exercised its lien is critical to the plaintiff’s remaining claim in conversion.

</div>  If the defendant validly exercised its lien to retain the PME cargo before the Storage Agreement was executed on 15 October 2014, then, according to the plaintiff, its claim for conversion of the 21.30 metric tonnes of the PME cargo delivered on 17 October 2014 would fail.  The plaintiff argues that the right of lien was not triggered and the defendant could not have exercised the lien over the PME cargo until much later in November 2014.  It premises this argument on the language of cl 20 (see [10] above).  The defendant’s right of lien would only have been triggered if there had been an “insufficiency of security”.  Insufficiency is measured by whether BG1 had enough credit to pay the amounts due and owing to the defendant, that is, its outstanding liabilities.  The BGs were not intended to cover future sums payable.  This was conceded by the defendant’s commercial manager, Ms Ong Saw Wah Susie (“Ms Ong”).

This was more than sufficient to cover the outstanding charges until the termination of the Service Agreement on 29 November 2014.

</div>  But, even then, the plaintiff argues that this estimated sum would only have become due and payable on 29 November 2014.  Cl 26.3 of the Service Agreement states that, in the event of the Service Agreement’s termination, “any sum due … or any sum expressly agreed to be payable … shall immediately become due and payable”.  The defendant therefore cannot assert that there was an actual insufficiency of security until the Service Agreement was terminated on 29 November 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 On the other hand, the defendant argues that there would have been an insufficiency of security, triggering its right to exercise the lien under cl 20, in any of three situations:

The right of lien under cl 20 would have been triggered and the defendant was entitled to exercise this lien over the goods in its possession or those which subsequently came into its possession.  The plaintiff’s interpretation of sufficient security, reflected at [83], is too narrow and does not reflect the intentions of the parties at the time when the Service Agreement was entered into.  The defendant points to the wording of cl 20 which provides for a lien to secure “all … sums payable” to “discharge … all liabilities”.  This indicates that the lien was intended to cover even sums which had yet to fall due under the Service Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The defendant points out that the right of lien was to ensure that the defendant would have sufficient security for the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> duration of the Service Agreement.  This is supported by the original wording of cl 39.1 which included the option of IBRIS providing a higher amount of security, S$8,250,000, in exchange for the need to provide a bank guarantee under cl 20.  This also explains the context behind cl 39’s variation on 29 November 2012.

</div>  On 11 September 2012, IBRIS provided a bank guarantee pursuant to cl 39.1(2) for the sum of S$5,625,000 which was intended to last for the rest of the Service Agreement, that is, up to July 2016.  However, it transpired that this bank guarantee was only valid for a period of seven months.  IBRIS faced difficulties in obtaining a bank guarantee to cover such a long period of time.  The defendant agreed to amend cl 39.1 such that IBRIS would provide BG1 and BG2.  The modified arrangement was intended to ensure that IBRIS would be able to supply security throughout the Service Agreement.  IBRIS’ failure to provide BG2 frustrated this objective.  According to the defendant, adopting the plaintiff’s interpretation of insufficiency would nullify IBRIS’ contractual obligations to provide BG2 on time.

</div>  This was not met with any objection by IBRIS.  In any event, the defendant submits that its right to exercise its lien would have arisen at the latest as of 29 November 2014 pursuant to cl 2.3 read with cl 26.3(2) of the Service Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In my judgment, on a proper interpretation of the relevant terms, there was only an insufficiency of security on 29 November 2014, which is when the Service Agreement was terminated.  There is no suggestion from the clear and unambiguous wording of cl 20 that the references to the sums payable and liabilities owed by IBRIS were meant to refer to existing <span class="font-italic">and</span> future obligations.  The defendant’s reference to the underlying commercial intent of having two bank guarantees instead of one is relevant because it shows the underlying contextual background, but it does not clearly show that parties would have considered the defendant to have insufficient security once BG2 was not provided by the contractual deadline of 29 May 2014, if there continued to be enough credit on BG1.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 When IBRIS failed to provide BG2 in accordance with the timeline set out under cl 39, the defendant gave IBRIS extensions of time to provide adequate security.  It did not immediately exercise the lien but only informed IBRIS that the continued failure to provide security would lead to such an eventuality.  At that time, BG1 was still valid.  The parties’ conduct suggests that the defendant believed that BG1 was sufficient security pending the receipt of BG2.  As conceded by Ms Ong, IBRIS’s liabilities had not then exceeded the outstanding value on BG1.  Thus, there would have been less urgency for the defendant to have required BG2 to be delivered immediately.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Ms Ong’s evidence also made it clear that the letter sent on 20 October 2014 quantifying the sums owed by IBRIS was only an estimate of the amounts that would become due from IBRIS.  A confirmed figure was to follow.  On the evidence before me, I find that there was no debt due from IBRIS at that point of time that exceeded BG1, which would render it insufficient.  It was only upon the termination of the Service Agreement that all of IBRIS’s obligations became due and owing, including the accelerated payments which would have been due up to July 2016.  It was at this point that BG1 would have clearly been insufficient to cover the sums owed to the defendant.   It was only then that the defendant have been able to exercise its lien under cl 20.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I should add that this appears consistent with the evidence that surprisingly emerged only during the cross-examination of Ms Ong that IBRIS had been permitted to discharge about 9,500 metric tonnes of a biodiesel product from Tank 1104 on <span class="font-italic">14 September 2014</span> and about 4,300 metric tonnes of another biodiesel product from Tank 1106 on <span class="font-italic">25 October 2014</span>.

The plaintiff submits that the defendant was obliged to give prior notice of its exercise and relies on the post-contractual conduct of the defendant to support this point.  On 25 July 2014, the defendant gave express notice to IBRIS as to the potential exercise of its lien.  This letter was sent by Mr Gilbert Liu (“Mr Liu”), the defendant’s regional legal counsel.  This was followed by the express “de-activation” of the lien on 30 July 2014.  Subsequently, in its email on 12 September 2014, the defendant clearly informed IBRIS that it was considering the “activation” of the lien.  According to the plaintiff, these examples suggest that the defendant recognised the necessity of giving notice and that there was a common understanding between the parties on this point.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiff submits that this is also in line with commercial reasoning.  It would be unrealistic for IBRIS to have a lien sprung on it without notice.  Ms Ong accepted that it was “reasonable and commercially necessary for [the defendant] to give notice [to IBRIS]”.

</div>  The plaintiff’s reliance on post-contractual correspondence between IBRIS and the defendant to demonstrate that notice was required is tantamount to rewriting the contract.  The defendant wrote to IBRIS in July and September not because it felt compelled to give notice but only out of goodwill.  It notified IBRIS of the consequences if it failed to provide BG2 only out of courtesy.

</div>  This does not mean a requirement of notice should be implied into the wording of the Service Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I have already outlined the general approach towards contractual interpretation (see [64] above).  Nevertheless, it is helpful to highlight the specific guidance by the Court of Appeal in respect of the admissibility of post-contractual conduct.  This was a point directly addressed in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [132(d)].  The Court held that there is no “absolute or rigid prohibition” against its admissibility.  However, in the normal case, it is likely that evidence of prior negotiations and subsequent conduct would not be relevant, reasonably available to the contracting parties or relate to a clear obvious context, rendering it inadmissible.  The position in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> was summarised by the Court in its subsequent decision, <span class="font-italic">Spor</span><span class="font-italic">ts Connection Pte Ltd v Deuter Sports GmbH</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 883 (“<span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span>”) at [70].  Evidence of post-contractual conduct is likely to be inadmissible where:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a party attempts to trawl through evidence in an attempt to favour its subjective interpretations of the contract and/or where a party attempts to persuade the court to adopt a different interpretation from that suggested by the plain language of the contract in a situation where the context of the contract concerned is <span class="font-italic">not</span> clear and obvious. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court in <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span> also reiterated the observation made in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>that the relevance of subsequent conduct “remains a controversial and evolving topic that will require more extensive scrutiny … at a more appropriate juncture” (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [132(d)]; <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span> at [71]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 On the point of implication of contractual terms, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) characterised the process of implying terms as a means of giving effect to the presumed intentions of the parties by filling gaps in the contract (at [93]). It also laid down a three step process to determine when implication is necessary (at [101]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The court should first ascertain whether there is a gap in the contract which can be remedied by implication.  It will only be appropriate for the court to imply a term where the parties did not contemplate that there would be a gap at all.  This is opposed to a situation where the parties contemplated the unaddressed issue but chose not to provide a term for it or were unable to agree on a term to resolve the issue.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The court must then consider whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply the term to give the contract efficacy – the “business efficacy” test.  </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court has to apply the “official bystander” test.  The suggested term must have been so obvious to the parties that if it had been suggested at the time of contracting, they would have agreed to such a term immediately. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The “business efficacy” test and the “official bystander” test are to be used in conjunction and complementarily.  The implied term should also be reasonable, equitable, capable of clear expression and must not contradict any express term of the contract (at [98]).  Terms are not to be implied into contracts lightly, it must be done only when it is necessary to do so (at [98], [100]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I am persuaded that the post-contractual of the defendant is relevant in determining whether cl 20 required the defendant to give notice that it was exercising its lien.  <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> and <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span> highlight that the relevance of post-contractual conduct remains a contentious area of law.  This point was more recently restated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v</span> <span class="font-italic">Jaicipto</span><span class="font-italic"> Jiaravanon</span> [2019] 1 SLR 696 at [78]. The courts are not foreclosed from considering such evidence although a decision either way is likely to be fact specific.  One example of where conduct was relevant is set out in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann Development Pte Ltd v Takashimaya Singapore Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 627, a case cited by the plaintiff in its submissions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Ngee Ann Development commenced proceedings against Takashimaya, the lessor of commercial space in the shopping centre, Ngee Ann City.  The parties’ dispute concerned the method of valuation of the space being leased by Takashimaya.  Prior to the commencement of proceedings, parties had agreed to conduct two rent reviews in 2003 and 2008.  The objective of these reviews was to determine the prevailing market value.  The new rent would then be calculated based on this figure.  The Court found that the rent reviews agreed upon by the parties were relevant in determining the parties’ understanding of how valuation was to be carried out.  The reviews provided a “useful and contemporaneous analogue to the present situation, … they provide an insight into the parties’ understanding of how the ‘prevailing market value’ of the Demised Premises has been and is to be determined moving forward” (at [86]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The wording of cl 20 is silent on notice.  It provides that the defendant “shall have a right of lien” but does not specify whether a requirement of notice is attached to this right.  In such circumstances, it is helpful to consider the post-contractual dealings of the parties, particularly since IBRIS failed to supply security on multiple occasions.  The defendant’s correspondence with IBRIS previews what it would have done if it were about to exercise its right of lien.  That being said, the language used by the defendant in this correspondence does not indicate that it regarded itself as being under an obligation of giving formal written notice before it could exercise its lien.  The letter sent by Mr Liu on 25 July 2014 informed IBRIS that the defendant had no choice “but to exercise the right of lien under the Service Agreement”.  This suggests that the defendant was merely communicating its intended course of action to IBRIS, rather than providing it with formal notice.  Similarly, the objective of the email dated 12 September 2014 was to inform IBRIS that the lien could be exercised if BG2 was not submitted.  There is no reference to a notice period.  When analysed from this perspective, the defendant’s conduct does not point to a requirement of notice.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 While the plaintiff argues that there are good commercial reasons why the defendant should have given notice, there are also commercial considerations as to why notice does not need to be given.  By providing IBRIS with reasonable notice as to when the lien would be exercised, IBRIS would have had the opportunity to remove the PME cargo from Tank 1102 and circumvent the effects of cl 20.

In my view, this threshold has not been met.  IBRIS and the defendant were commercial parties and it is fair to assume that the unqualified provision of a “right of lien” in cl 20 was intentional.  I do not think that it is <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> to imply a requirement of notice to give the Service Agreement business efficacy.  Quite the contrary, if the defendant was required to give prior written notice before the lien can be exercised, it might defeat the whole purpose of having a lien because IBRIS could simply remove its products that are stored in the tanks.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Operationally, it also makes no sense for the defendant to be required to give advance notice before it can exercise its lien over any stored products.  This is because a customer already has to give the defendant seven to ten days’ notice of its intention to remove any products stored in the tanks.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The wording of the 12 September email does not support the defendant’s assertions.  All that was communicated to the IBRIS was the possibility that the defendant might “activate” its lien if BG2 was not supplied.  This does not amount to a communication that the defendant was intending to retain possession of the PME cargo.  It was only a possibility, contingent on whether IBRIS complied with the defendant’s instructions.  This does not amount to an exercise of the lien.  In any case, as I have found, the right of lien only arose on 29 November 2014 and the defendant would not have been able to validly exercise it prior to that date.  I find that the defendant could have exercised its right of lien upon the termination of the Service Agreement on 29 November 2014, at the same time when the right arose.  As I have found above, no prior notice of any exercise was required from the defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I should add that the act of the defendant refusing to take any instructions from IBRIS, if such had been given, for the removal of the PME cargo would have been an exercise of its contractual lien.  In this case, there was no evidence that there was any attempt by IBRIS to remove the PME cargo.  The instructions instead came from the plaintiff, via its solicitor’s letter, asserting its right to possession of the PME cargo in its letter of 16 February 2015.  By then, the defendant’s right of lien had arisen and its refusal to comply with the letter was an exercise of its lien over the PME cargo.       </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What if the plaintiff held title to the PME? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Finally, I consider whether the foregoing analysis would differ if the plaintiff, as opposed to IBRIS, had held title to the PME cargo at the time when the defendant’s right to exercise its lien arose.  This analysis is in any event necessary since I have found that the plaintiff retained title to 21.30 metric tonnes of the PME delivered on 17 October 2014 after the execution of the Storage Agreement.  The defendant argues that its lien could still be validly exercised over the PME cargo because the plaintiff consented to and authorised the storage of the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The law on agency is well established.  For present purposes it is sufficient to reiterate a few key principles.  Actual authority refers to a legal relationship generated by way of a consensual agreement between a principal and his agent (<span class="font-italic">Freeman &amp; Lockyer</span><span class="font-italic"> (a firm) v Buckhurt Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another</span> [1965] 2 QB 480 (“<span class="font-italic">Freeman &amp; Lockyer</span>”) at p 502).  This authority may either be express or implied, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is inferred from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case.  Apparent authority refers to the legal relationship between the principal and a contractor created by a representation by the former that his agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract (<span class="font-italic">Freeman &amp; Lockyer</span> at p 503).  Although there is some disagreement over the theoretical basis for apparent authority (Tan Cheng Han SC, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency, </span>(Singapore Academy of Law: Academy Publishing, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span>”) at para [05.005]), the predominant view is that a representation by the principal “operates as an estoppel”: <span class="font-italic">Freeman &amp; Lockyer</span> at p 503 (see also, <span class="font-italic">Banque</span><span class="font-italic"> Nationale de Paris v Tan Nancy and another </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 726 at [68]).  In the absence of authority, a principal may still ratify his agent’s conduct either expressly or impliedly.  This may even be inferred by silence or inactivity (<span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 241 at [35]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Both parties have presented lengthy submissions on whether authority was granted to IBRIS, and if it was not, whether the plaintiff ratified IBRIS’s conduct, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, its storage of the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal.  In tackling these questions, I find it instructive to consider the case of <span class="font-italic">Jowitt</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Sons v Union Cold Storage Company </span>[1913] 3 KB 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Jowitt</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Sons</span>”).  British Standard Produce Company Limited (“British Standard”) was in the meat and stored frozen meat business.  The plaintiffs financed British Standard’s business by paying the purchase price for Australian frozen meat being imported into England.  They then reimbursed themselves out of the proceeds of bills of exchange discounted by the Bank of Australasia.  These bills had been drawn to the bank’s order by the plaintiffs and accepted by British Standard.  Bills of lading for the meat were deposited with the bank as security that the bills of exchange would be met.  Upon the meat’s shipment to England, British Standard placed it in the defendants’ cold store.  The meat was to be delivered to the bank’s order or against the bills of lading.  An express term of the storage agreement stipulated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Goods are only received subject to a general lien for all charges accrued and accruing against the storer or for any other moneys due from the owners of the goods, and if not removed after seven days notice has been given to the storer, or sent by post to his last known address, may be sold to defray the liens and all expenses incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 British Standard defaulted on the bills of exchange. The plaintiffs paid the bank and, having obtained the bills of lading from the bank, presented these to the defendant demanding delivery of the meat.  The defendants refused, purporting to exercise a lien over the meat for the storage charges due from British Standard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Scrutton J made several important findings.  The bank knew that British Standard had stored the meat with the defendants and that there would have been a storage agreement between the parties.  Importantly, it was not relevant that the bank did not know the specific details of the storage agreement or the precise wording of the clauses.  It had to be assumed that the bank would have been aware that the usual terms of the agreement included a general lien.  In authorising the storage of the meat with the defendants, the bank (and the plaintiffs) were subject to the defendants’ lien. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 This reasoning can be analogised with the present facts.  The plaintiff was aware that IBRIS was storing the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal.  It was not necessary for the plaintiff to have been aware of the existence of cl 20 of the Service Agreement or its precise terms.  As a commercial party it should have appreciated that a right of lien would have been present in the Service Agreement.  The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Nurtanio, gave evidence that it is in fact industry practice that:

In fact, that must have been why the plaintiff and IBRIS came up with the idea of the Storage Agreement.  In my view, it was an attempt, albeit ill-conceived, to circumvent any lien that the defendant had over the PME cargo.  Thus, I find that the PME cargo, even if it continued to be owned by the plaintiff, would be subject to the contractual lien in the Service Agreement.  The upshot of this is that the defendant was entitled to exercise its lien over the entirety of the PME cargo, including the delivery of 21.30 metric tonnes to which the plaintiff retained title to by way of the execution of the Storage Agreement, as I have found. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 My findings above as to actual authority means that it is unnecessary for me to come to any definitive conclusion on the issue of IBRIS’s apparent authority.  Here, the plaintiff raises the point that it never made any kind of unequivocal representation to the defendant that IBRIS was the plaintiff’s agent in respect of the PME cargo.

</div>  It never communicated in any way with the defendant prior to or when the PME cargo was being transferred into Tank 1102.  In fact, the defendant’s own evidence is that it did not even know of the plaintiff’s existence, until the plaintiff surfaced at the end of December 2014 to claim that it was the owner of the PME cargo.

</div>  Hence, an estoppel cannot arise, and in its absence, no apparent authority can be found.  These are forceful points.  “There is no sufficient representation if the representation flows from the agent rather than the principal; an agent cannot make a representation as to his own authority” (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para [05.034]. See also, <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> Enskilda Banker AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2011] 3 SLR 540 (“<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>”) at [38]).  Having said that, there are certain circumstances where a party may be held liable as principal even where no manifestation or representation as to the authority of another party to act on its behalf has been made to a third party (Peter Watts &amp; F M B Reynolds, <span class="font-italic">Bowstead</span><span class="font-italic"> and Reynolds on Agency</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2014 at para [2-101]).  What constitutes such circumstances remains uncertain  (<span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5”</span> [2016] 2 SLR 1114 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati</span>”) at [8]).  However, it appears that, where there is a legal or equitable duty to make a disclosure, communication or correction, silence or inaction may be taken as a valid representation for the purposes of establishing a basis for estoppel (<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati </span>at [14]).  Here, there were certain aspects of the plaintiff’s conduct that might have caused the defendant to form the belief that either the PME cargo was owned by IBRIS or that IBRIS had the true owner’s authority to store the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal and subject it to the defendant’s right of lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The plaintiff claimed to have title over the entirety of the PME cargo.  As I have found, it only retained title to the last batch of the PME cargo that was delivered on 17 October 2014, that is, 21.30 metric tonnes.  Be that as it may, it is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff knew that the PME cargo was being stored at the Banyan Terminal, which belonged to the defendant.  The plaintiff knew that the defendant would have charged IBRIS for such storage services.  Further, as I have found, the plaintiff must have known that the defendant would have some form of lien over the stored products for unpaid charges.  Yet, despite its claim to ownership over the PME cargo, the plaintiff remained silent and did not inform the defendant as soon as possible about its position about title over the PME cargo.  Neither is there any evidence before me that the plaintiff had instructed IBRIS to inform the defendant of the plaintiff’s ownership.  If the defendant had been so informed, it could well have refused to store the PME cargo until an agreement had been reached with the plaintiff as to storage charges and its right of lien.  After all, both the plaintiff and defendant knew at the material time that IBRIS was in financial difficulties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In these rather specific circumstances, while I have not come to a firm conclusion on this point, the facts do suggest that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">may</span> be estopped from denying the defendant’s right of lien over the PME cargo.  This is because the plaintiff had effectively constituted IBRIS as its bailee for the specific purpose of storing, or continuing the storage of, the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal.  The plaintiff then arguably had a “duty to speak” to correct what it ought to have known would be the defendant’s wrong impression.  Its failure to do so led the defendant to believe it could exercise its lien over the cargo.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendant’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The defendant argues that the plaintiff is liable for storage charges and other expenses incurred (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, cleaning and waste disposal fees) between 1 October 2014 and 6 June 2015.  The particulars of its counterclaim are set out at [37] above.  The defendant’s position is that its entitlement to these sums flows from the plaintiff’s authorisation to IBRIS to store the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal.  Further, the defendant asserts that it has a claim in unjust enrichment, the requirements of which are set out in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [110].  The plaintiff was unjustly enriched by storing the PME at the Banyan Terminal at no cost.  This was at the expense of the defendant, who was unable to utilise Tank 1102 and its connecting tanks, Tanks 1104 and 1106, owing to the “common system”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In light of the fact that title passed to IBRIS for the PME delivered prior to 15 October 2014 and, more importantly, because the defendant’s lien operated over the PME cargo in its totality, I find that the plaintiff is not liable for these amounts claimed.  Assuming that the plaintiff still held title, while IBRIS was impliedly conferred with authority to store the PME cargo at the Banyan Terminal and to subject it to the defendant’s right of lien <span class="font-italic">until full payment of what IBRIS owed</span>, it does not follow that the plaintiff is bound to pay storage charges incurred by IBRIS.  The defendant has not shown that IBRIS had actual or apparent authority to bind the plaintiff to an obligation to pay the storage charges in the Service Agreement to the defendant.  Furthermore, as pointed out by the plaintiff, the defendant has not pleaded a claim in <span class="font-italic">quantum </span><span class="font-italic">meruit</span> for charges in respect of its storage of the PME cargo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The defendant’s unjust enrichment argument is also untenable.  The critical point here is that the defendant is entitled to exercise its lien over the whole of the PME cargo, which militates against any argument that the plaintiff has been unjustly enriched.  The submission about the “common system” is also not supported by the evidence, which instead shows that the defendant had the ability to “blind off”
