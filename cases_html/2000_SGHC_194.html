<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font>
</p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The plaintiff is a professional racehorse trainer as well as a

co-owner of the "Happy Happy Stable". The defendant is a horse racing club and a

member of the Malaysian Racing Association ("MRA") which regulates horse racing

in Singapore and West Malaysia through four racing associations, including the defendant.

On 23 August 2000 the plaintiff pleaded guilty to five charges of misconduct against him

and was disqualified as a trainer for two years on each of the charges, but the

disqualification periods are to run consecutively. The plaintiff brought this action with

the view of setting aside the conviction and sentence. The present application before me

was taken out by the plaintiff seeking an interim injunction against the defendant from

enforcing the disqualification before the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The story began on 19 August 2000 when <i>Crystal Chilavert</i>, one

of the plaintiff’s horses, was withdrawn just before the race for failing a pre-race

blood test. A substance known as Telzenac (which is a commercial name for Eltenac, an

anti-inflammatory drug) was found in the blood of the horse. The plaintiff was

subsequently informed that the same substance was found in <i>Prinz Oskar</i>, <i>Star

Dragon</i>, and <i>Sky Warrior</i> - horses either trained by him or under his care. A

search of the plaintiff’s office on the very day yielded nothing of interest. His car

was then searched, and a sling bag was found on the front floorboard. The sling bag

contained a brown clutch bag in which contained some prohibited drugs of which Telzenac

(in two 20 ml bottles) was one. Five syringes and 14 needles were also recovered from the

bag.</p>
<p align="justify">3. On 22 August 2000 David Fisher, the defendant’s Chief

Stipendiary Steward, told the plaintiff by telephone to attend an inquiry the next day in

respect of the articles seized from him. A written notice of the same date was also served

on the plaintiff. The inquiry was convened on 23 August 2000 at 1.05pm. The panel

consisted of David Fisher as chairman, and three stipendiary stewards, Scott Matthews,

Peter Chadwick, and Rajendran Pavadai. The plaintiff was present by himself. The inquiry

commenced with the following remarks by David Fisher to the plaintiff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Mr Ang the Stipendiary Stewards are inquiring into a matter

  relating to a report, a written report that I received from the Security Department of the

  Singapore Turf Club. I would advise you at the outset of this inquiry that a charge or

  charges may be laid against you from evidence emanating from this Inquiry. You may call

  any witnesses to the Inquiry and make any statements to the Stewards and you can present

  any evidence that you wish. You can question any evidence or witnesses that the

  Stipendiary Stewards might introduce. Do you understand your position and rights?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff acknowledged his understanding of David Fisher’s

opening address to him, and after a brief introduction to the members of the panel, the

inquiry continued with the plaintiff answering questions put to him. The session ended at

2.10pm and the panel retired to consider the proceedings. When it resumed at 2.38pm the

plaintiff was notified that he is being charged with five counts of contravention of the

MRA Rules. The first charge was under Rule 203 (d) (i) and (ii), and the remaining four

under Rule 200(5). The first charge related to possession of any prohibited substance or

instruments for the administration of a prohibited substance. The four other charges

related to the administration of a prohibited substance into a horse that had been entered

for a race. The charges were read to the plaintiff who pleaded guilty to all of them. His

guilty plea was accepted and consequently, the panel disqualified him as a trainer for a

total of ten years.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The plaintiff brought this action in order to set aside the

convictions and disqualification. In the meantime, he wants to be reinstated. The

plaintiff’s arguments are based on his assertion that he has a likelihood of success,

and that even if he were to fail, the punishment would not be so harsh as to merit a

ten-year disqualification. In applications of this kind, the court must first inquire what

sort of harm the plaintiff will suffer if the interim injunction is not granted and

whether damages will be an adequate remedy. The plaintiff here says that he will not be

able to work and will lose the income he would otherwise earn. </p>
<p align="justify">5. This is not a situation in which the plaintiff has been charged but

not yet proven guilty. The inquiry is over and the plaintiff had admitted to the charges

and condemned on their account. It is almost always invidious to try and determine the

merits of the substantive case in the course of interim proceedings. Unless full arguments

are presented it would be neither reasonable nor fair for a judge to give his opinion as

to the plaintiff’s (or defendant’s as the case may be) chances of success. It is

not appropriate to present arguments here tending to engage the issues at trial, and more

so when the plaintiff also has a pending appeal against his disqualification before the

panel of Racing Stewards. In such circumstances, the balance of convenience weighs in

favour of maintaining the tribunal’s decisions. Mr Arul urged me to maintain the

status quo, that is, according to him, reinstating the plaintiff’s licence. With

respect, that is not the status quo. That is the position prior to the status quo.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Mr Palmer, representing the defendant, referred me to <i>Russell v

Duke of Norfolk</i> <i>[1949] 1 All ER 109</i> in response to some of Mr Arul’s most

strenuous arguments against the stipendiary stewards for failing to adhere to the rules of

natural justice. I agree that there is a strong similarity in fact and issue in that case

to the present one, and Tucker LJ’s judgment speaks persuasively in favour of the

stewards’ handling of the inquiry there, but as I have said, these are matters for

the trial. The plaintiff had meticulously set out in his affidavit the various heads of

loss suffered by him as a result of his disqualification. Perusing them, I am satisfied

that damages will be an adequate relief should he succeed at trial. There was no question

before me that the defendant will be unable to pay if so ordered at trial. Mr Arul

referred to a passage from the decision in <i>Kok Seng Chong v Bukit Turf Club <nobr>[1993] 2 SLR 3</nobr>, 20</i> which he said supports the contention that loss of professional reputation

is not something "capable of compensation by damages". I understand that passage

as really saying that compensation for loss of professional reputation is not as easily

quantifiable as compensation for loss of income. But I think that it is nonetheless

capable of assessment, and that is good enough. In any event, an interim injunction will

not help the plaintiff’s reputation here. Nothing short of an outright vindication

will do, but that cannot be realised before the full trial.</p>
<p align="justify">7. For the reasons above I dismissed the plaintiff’s application.</p>
