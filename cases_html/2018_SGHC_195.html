He stated that KK Asia expected to commence operations in Malaysia by 1 March 2015. Robin requested that all purchases of KK Asia thenceforth should be shipped to Malaysia. By a subsequent email dated 21 January 2015, KK Asia instructed Forest Fibers to change the pending shipment’s destination port to Malaysia (Port Klang) from Singapore and the consignee’s name from KK Asia to Teguh Jaya Polymer Sdn Bhd (“Teguh Jaya”). Forest Fibers acceded to the request. The same instructions from KK Asia were repeated for a subsequent shipment.

In a draft of the revised purchasing financing agreement, the party that was supposed to contract with Forest Fibers Hong Kong (“Forest Fibers HK”) (and not Forest Fibers) was stated to be KK Asia Malaysia located at BHD No. 49, Jalan LJ2, Taman Industri Lembah Jaya, 68000 Ampang, Selangor). Instead, Domenico was told by Robin that KK Asia was using a company called Teguh Jaya (see [7]) to process the raw materials shipped by Forest Fibers. Domenico subsequently ascertained from Robin that the import of raw waste material into Malaysia required a particular import licence which KK Asia did not but Teguh Jaya possessed. Domenico was concerned that Forest Fibers was shipping raw materials to KK Asia without any security or payment. He wanted a personal guarantee from the Lohs to secure KK Asia’s obligations.

Domenico agreed and Forest Fibers remitted US$39,033.20, US$29,859.48 and US$59,165.92 to KK Asia to pay import duties.  These payments totalled US$128,058.60.

If the Lohs walked away, Forest Fibers would lose everything.

Although the Lohs wanted him to buy over the entire company, Domenico was only prepared to buy over 50% of KK Asia. The Lohs asked what Domenico considered to be a ridiculous sum of US$2m for their shares which offer Domenico promptly rejected. Eventually the parties agreed on a consideration of US$200,000 (“the purchase price”) for Forest Fibers’ purchase of 50% of the issued shares in KK Asia (“the shares”). In exchange, Domenico wanted an option (to which the Lohs agreed) that Forest Fibers could sell back the shares to the Lohs at the same price with interest if KK Asia did not turn in a profit within a certain timeline. Instead of Forest Fibers, Domenico decided to use a related company namely RGA to be the purchaser of the shares.

However, no delivery orders were produced by any of the defendants nor were there shipping documents to prove finished/processed goods had been shipped out by or on behalf of KK Asia from Port Klang or elsewhere to either Forest Fibers or RGA, or to their buyers.

The court was told that Forest Fibers was a registered shipper with the Malaysia port authorities but Robin omitted to convey that information to his customers. Hence, when containers arrived at Port Klang for KK Asia from other (non-registered) shippers, the port authorities would not allow the shipments to be cleared through customs. Domenico testified that Robin should be but was never proactive – Robin usually acted after the fact which in such cases meant he tried to change the name of the shipper after the goods had arrived but (as the court observed) it was too late.

</div> None of this new testimony was to be found in any of Robin’s affidavits or in his AEICs.  Indeed, there was a letter dated 22 April 2016 (at 3AB1464) from Teguh Jaya to KK Asia that stated KK Asia owed Teguh Jaya RM1,098,701.90 for (i) processing 481.56 m/t of raw materials @ RM1,000 per m/t (totalling RM481,560), (ii) RM270,000 for arrears of rent for 6 months @ RM45,000 per month, (iii) factory expenses of RM111,304.70 as well as (iv) RM235,837.20 for detention, demurrage, storage and handling charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-justify">112 Despite his denial when it was put to Robin,

</div> it was clear from the evidence that the Lohs had subcontracted KK Asia’s obligations under the revised PFA to Teguh Jaya in all aspects namely (i) collection of and clearing of the raw materials when they arrived at port, and (ii) processing the same thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 What was equally clear was that the Lohs naively thought they could make easy money from the entire exercise. Under the revised PFA, KK Asia charged Forest Fibers US$320 per m/t to process the raw materials. The processing work was then subcontracted to Teguh Jaya at RM1,000 per m/t which equated to about US$250 per m/t. The Lohs/KK Asia could have made a profit on the difference of US$70 per m/t for doing no work.

The plaintiffs’ claims were well documented and satisfactorily explained by Domenico. The court finds that on a balance of probabilities Forest Fibers and RGA have proven their case against KK Asia and the Lohs.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first suit</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(a) Was Teguh Jaya the agent/subcontractor of KK Asia?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 On the evidence, there is no doubt that Teguh Jaya was KK Asia’s agent/subcontractor in regard to the latter’s obligations under the revised PFA. Teguh Jaya acted as the clearing agent for the raw materials shipped by Forest Fibers and then processed those raw materials into finished products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The Lohs had passed onto Teguh Jaya all the obligations of KK Asia under the revised FPA without regard to the consequences of breach and ignoring Robin’s guarantee contained in clause 16 therein. The subcontracting arrangement with Teguh Jaya would only have succeeded and enabled KK Asia and in turn the Lohs to collect their middleman “cut” of US$70 per m/t (at [113]) had the Lohs paid Teguh Jaya for clearing the raw materials shipped to Malaysia by Forest Fibers, for the subcontracting works and for rent and other overheads in making use of Teguh Jaya’s premises; they did not.  As the plaintiffs stated in their closing submissions (at para 50), the revised PFA envisaged a steady cycle of raw materials supplied by Forest Fibers, processing by KK Asia and sale of finished products. It was this steady cycle that would create a consistent flow of revenue that would enable Forest Fibers and KK Asia to get paid, Unfortunately, Forest Fibers’ expectation of how the revised PFA would have operated did not come to fruition because of the misconduct of the Lohs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Once the agency of Teguh Jaya for KK Asia was established (as the court finds), it was no longer tenable for the Lohs to maintain their defence that KK Asia did not receive the raw materials shipped by Forest Fibers and consigned to Teguh Jaya on the instructions of Robin. That also meant that KK Asia and not the plaintiffs is liable for the claims of Teguh Jaya that the defendants attempted to pass on to the plaintiff(s). Robin’s testimony that Teguh Jaya was “everybody’s agent” is pure nonsense. Apart from the one incident (in [36]) where Domenico negotiated with Teguh Jaya to try to recover the raw materials of Forest Fibers that had been shipped/consigned to Teguh Jaya at KK Asia’s behest, neither plaintiff had any dealings whatsoever with Teguh Jaya. This was confirmed by Teguh Jaya in the affidavit it filed in Forest Fibers’ Malaysian proceedings at [108].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The oral as well as documentary evidence adduced in court showed clearly that the Lohs paid scant regard to their obligations whether under the revised PFA or the SSA. They were prepared to go to any lengths to take advantage of and/or make money from their fellow shareholder cum supplier RGA/Forest Fibers.  This can be seen from the following incidents:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Apparently overcharging Forest Fibers or allowing Teguh Jaya to overcharge by US$45 per m/t (see [76]) for import duties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Attempting to make a profit of US$70 per m/t between what KK Asia charged Forest Fibers for processing raw materials and what Teguh Jaya charged for doing the work;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  Undermining the efforts made by Domenico to recover the containers of raw materials and/or processed goods from Teguh Jaya and/or other companies belonging to Chai (see [37], [104] and [106]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Selling No. 246 despite their undertaking not to sell either of the Properties under clause 3.7 of the SSA (at [14]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Selling the processed goods that belonged to Forest Fibers and not paying the sale proceeds to Forest Fibers as seen in the transaction with Hongxin at [96].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(b) Was the revised PFA a valid and binding agreement? If it was, did the defendants breach the agreement?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As pointed out earlier (at [100]), the counterclaim in the first suit was premised on the revised PFA being valid and subsisting. The Lohs cannot approbate and reprobate – where it suited their purpose (as in the counterclaim), they relied on the revised PFA but where it was against their interests, they asserted that the revised PFA was only a draft. They cannot have it both ways. The parties had operated for about six months based on the terms of the revised PFA according to Domenico’s AEIC (at para 148) which Robin accepted.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The evidence presented also showed that KK Asia breached its obligations in the revised PFA as, despite being supplied with raw materials by Forest Fibers in February and March 2015, it failed to deliver the finished products by end May/early June or at all as was envisaged.  In addition, the Lohs effectively abandoned KK Asia’s operation in Malaysia by end August 2015 leaving Domenico to fend for Forest Fibers the best he could. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic"> (c) Was RGA a party to the SSA and did the Lohs breach the provisions?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The defendants’ pleaded case (in para 4 of their defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 1) in the second suit) was that they contracted with Domenico and not RGA. They asserted that they only recognised Domenico not RGA, as the rightful owner of 50% of the shares in KK Asia. They relied on Article 7 of the memorandum and articles of association of KK Asia to support their contention. The article (at 3AB1295) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding any share upon any trust, and the company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or unit of a share or (except only as by these Regulations or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span>The plaintiffs’ closing submissions (at paras 99 to 105) pointed out that Article 7 itself does not prohibit a trust or make it invalid. It merely states that KK Asia shall not be bound to recognise a trust. The plaintiff added that a valid trust may be formed so long as the intention of the settlor to create the trust is certain, the identity of the trust property is certain and the identity of the beneficiaries is defined with some precision (citing the appellate court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 1097 at [51]). Here, Domenico had expressly declared he held the shares in KK Asia on trust for RGA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The court notes that Article 7 contains an exception “[e]xcept as required by law” and “except…by law otherwise provided”. I would construe those words to mean that the law can declare there is a valid trust if the situation warrants it. I also accept the plaintiffs’ argument that independent of the trust arrangement between Domenico and RGA and regardless of whether it is recognised, the basis of RGA’s claim is contractual -- namely the SSA and it does not hinge on RGA being a shareholder of KK Asia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 It is therefore the court’s finding that RGA is the purchaser of the shares in the SSA. This is reinforced by the fact that RGA not Domenico is a party to the executed SSA and that the former’s related company paid KK Asia (at the Lohs’ behest) the purchase price. The inclusion of Domenico’s name as shareholder in the company’s records and in the company resolution was an error on the part of KK Asia’s company secretary. Unfortunately, as Domenico candidly admitted,

</div> he was so engrossed with the problems he was then facing with KK Asia, the Lohs and/or Teguh Jaya in September 2015, that he overlooked the error that his name and not RGA’s was stated in the share transfer form prepared by KK Asia’s company secretary. RGA should not be held accountable for the mistake made by KK Asia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In the light of the above findings, the Lohs’ action at [68] in selling No. 246 and their failure to pay half the outstanding sums owed to RGA by KK Asia as set out in [41] and [42], meant that they had breached clauses 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 of the SSA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(d) Are the plaintiffs entitled to their monetary claims against the defendants?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I shall now deal with the claim of Forest Fibers for damages under the first suit (see [49]). There was also a claim for a declaration of the validity of the guarantee from Robin under clause 16 of the SSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Forest Fibers claimed the market price of the raw materials it had supplied to KK Asia as set out in [46] above. Added thereon was the claim for finance and administrative charge at US$25 per m/t pursuant to clause 4 of the revised PFA which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Regarding the financing of the plastic waste raw material, decision supplied to [KK Asia], all transactions bought rather from [Forest Fibers], or [Forest Fibers] through [KK Asia] supplies, or [KK Asia] buying direct, shall go through the [Forest Fibers] finance process a $US25.00 per ton charge will be added to every metric ton bought in order to cover the service.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The claim in [46] was for 2,611.038 m/t of raw materials supplied to KK Asia. The total claim of Forest Fibers inclusive of the US$25 per m/t finance/administrative charge amounted to US$719,799.13 less US$13,087.55 and US$5,629.05 in [46], which breakdown was given in Domenico’s AEIC at para 116. Copies of invoices, shipping and other documents pertaining to the supply of raw materials were annexed to Domenico’s AEIC (at pp 899 to 961) to support the figure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Forest Fibers’ claim against Robin was premised on clause 16 of the revised PFA which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This agreement shall be bonded by personal guarantees by both parties: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- [Forest Fibers] shall make sure any extra proceeds from the transactions or payments due to [KK Asia] will be personal guaranteed by [Forest Fibers HK], shareholder [Domenico] living in the province of Quebec, Canada whose number of passport is….</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- That [KK Asia] will make sure that, all financing provided by [Forest Fibers] or [Forest Fibers HK], will be return (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) 100% within the due times of payments for invoices or inventory, or aswell whenever this agreement shall terminate that Forest Fibers will get back all their cash investment and not incur any losses. This will be personal guaranteed, by Loh Choon Phing Robin living in Singapore, whose number of passport is… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Notwithstanding the poor drafting of the clause (and the revised PFA in general), there is no ambiguity in the wording as to the parties’ intentions. Despite Robin’s valiant attempts, there can be little doubt that the words “KK Asia” on page 1 of the revised PFA with the word “Singapore” added thereafter by Robin in his handwriting (see [16] and [79]) must refer to KK Asia as there was/is no such legal entity as KK Asia Malaysia and no other Singapore entity other than KK Asia.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I turn next to the second suit. First, there was the claim for advances made by Forest Fibers (at [35]) totalling US$59,488.38. Earlier (at [88]), the court had noted from Domenico’s testimony that Forest Fibers mistakenly overpaid Teguh Jaya in that its payment of US$9,700 should have been RM9,700. There is no reason for KK Asia (or Robin as its guarantor) to bear the loss sustained by Forest Fibers from its own mistake. Consequently, Forest Fibers is only entitled to recover back 50% of US$49,799.38 (US$59,488.38­US$9,700) namely US$24,894.19 and 50% of RM9,700 namely RM4,850.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I should mention that the Lohs had disputed the advances totalling US$59,488.38 in para 6 of the defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 1) in the second suit as seen in [55]. The plaintiff’s answer to their objection was to rely on the deeming provision in Order 27, rule 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, Section 80, 2014 Rev Ed). It states:</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><table class="table table-sm d-flex justify-content-center table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>—(1)  Subject to paragraph (2) and without prejudice to the right of a party to object to the admission in evidence of any document, a party on whom a list of documents is served in pursuance of any provision of Order 24 or any order made thereunder shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be deemed to admit —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that any document described in the list as an original document is such a document and was printed, written, signed or executed as it purports respectively to have been; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that any document described therein as a copy is a true copy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">This paragraph does not apply to a document the authenticity of which the party has denied in his pleading.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">(2)  If before the expiration of 14 days after inspection of the documents specified in a list of documents or after the time limited for inspection of those documents expires, whichever is the later, the party to whom the list is served serves on the party whose list it is a notice stating, in relation to any documents specified therein, that he does not admit the authenticity of that document and requires it to be proved at the trial, he shall not be deemed to make any admission in relation to that document under paragraph (1).</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The plaintiffs pointed out that the defendants only raised objections to the authenticity of the documents supporting the figures in [35] at a very late stage just before trial, when the agreed bundles of documents were prepared. Consequently, it was too late for the defendants to dispute the documents as O 27, r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) deemed them to have been admitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">136 T</span>he loans extended by RGA to KK Asia totalling US$149,578.05 have been set out at [28]. Documentary evidence to support the four loans comprised in the figure was produced in court and satisfied the requisite burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In this regard, the court notes that the documents in the three volumes of the agreed bundles produced in court were only agreed by the Lohs as dispensing with formal proof. However, the contents in such banking documents as the wire transfer of the purchase price of the shares (at 2AB874) (see [82]) can hardly be challenged. They merely state the particulars of the sender and the recipient or beneficiary. The Lohs disputed the wire transfer from Gestions RGA of US$200,000. Yet they accepted the evidence contained in the following wire transfers to KK Asia which were all similar to that from Gestions RGA:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remitter</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount in US$</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">7 May 2015</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">21,367,00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">8 May 2015 </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">37,487.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">22 May 2015</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">60,724.05</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">8 June 2015 </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">39,033.20</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">18 June 2015 </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Gestions RGA</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">22,977.50</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">25 June 2015</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">45,227.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">30 June 2015</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">29,859.48</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1 July 2015 </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Forest Fibers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">29,836.98</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Total </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">286,512.21</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If the Lohs accepted the above remittances as having been made, there is no reason for them to dispute the remittance of the purchase price of the shares from Gestions RGA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The same observation would apply to the other documents in the agreed bundles – the Lohs were equally selective in their agreement to the truth of contents of documents, depending on whether it suited their purpose. As an example, the Lohs disputed the contents of email correspondence even when they emanated from Robin and/or staff of KK Asia and sent to Forest Fibers’ staff, between 20 October 2014 and 1 March 2018. Some of those documents were listed in the defendants’ own list of documents. Their stand only serves to reinforce the court’s unflattering view of the Lohs’ conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Robin’s testimony that Forest Fibers did not extend a loan of US$120,000.00 to KK Asia is untenable in the light of the Lohs’ clear acknowledgement of receipt of that sum in clause 3.5 of the SSA coupled with their joint and several undertaking to refund 50% of that sum (with interest) to RGA by 31 December 2016 should KK Asia fail to repay the loan by 30 December 2016. If indeed the loan of US$120,000 was not extended, it was very much out of Robin’s character not to have chased Forest Fibers/Domenico for the sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 At this juncture, it would be appropriate to refer to the parol evidence rule encapsulated in section 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)) which precludes the admission of testimony that contradicts a written agreement. The section states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">94.</span>  When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved according to section 93, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The exceptions in ss 94 (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">f</span>) would not apply here so as to displace the application of s 94 itself.  The plaintiffs had also cited the guidelines set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [131] to reinforce their point on when extrinsic evidence should be admitted to affect written contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 As for the other loan of US$30,000 extended on or about 15 July 2015, Robin’s testimony was not that the loan was not extended but that it came from Gestions RGA, a related company of RGA. It is irrelevant from which source RGA procured the sum from. There was no evidence that Robin objected to the fact that the remittance did not come from RGA and he certainly made no attempts to return the money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Finally, there are the claims for advances made on behalf of KK Asia to Teguh Jaya for import and other related expenses to obtain the raw materials shipped by Forest Fibers amounting to US$128,058.60 (see [45]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 There is the further sum of US$43,600 that Domenico paid to Teguh Jaya in his attempts to recover Forest Fibers’ raw materials in order to mitigate its loss. The case of <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Asia Star” </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [24] cited by the plaintiffs is authority for the principle that an aggrieved party who takes reasonable steps to mitigate its loss is entitled to recover expenses reasonably incurred in the course of taking such mitigating measures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I therefore find that the other items in [35] were all incurred on behalf of KK Asia. The first sum of US$11,461.56 was advanced to Wawasan Aspirasi Packaging at the request of Peter while the second sum of US$14,462 was another advance made at the request of KK Asia’s employee Hwee Qun (via email dated 11 August 2015 (at 2AB1213)) for the spare part purchases and machinery repairs carried out by Genox for KK Asia. I should add that Hwee Qun’s email request was one of the documents which contents the Lohs chose to dispute notwithstanding it emanated from KK Asia.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The next items of US$19,913.83 and US$3,950.99 were expenses incurred for the running of KK Asia’s plant in Malaysia after the Lohs effectively abandoned ship and Domenico was forced to despatch Luis from Forest Fibers’ office to take charge of operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Next, I deal with the loans extended to KK Asia.  At law, where there are no stipulations as to the time of repayment, a loan is generally repayable at once without any previous demand (see <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span><span class="font-italic"> on Contracts</span> vol 2 (H G Beale gen ed)(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2015) at p 1429 para 39-266). The plaintiffs had cited <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 at [101] to submit that a term must be implied that the plaintiffs’ loans were repayable on demand as a matter of business efficacy. The court accepts this proposition of law. Hence, the demands made by Forest Fibers and RGA of KK Asia and the Lohs for repayment of advances made by the plaintiffs were perfectly valid.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I reiterate that the signatories to the SSA upon which the plaintiffs based their claims were RGA and the Lohs, not Domenico. Consequently, the records of KK Asia filed with the regulatory authorities should be rectified to reflect that RGA and not Domenico is the owner of the shares in the company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The counterclaims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Not one iota of evidence let alone credible evidence was produced to support the defendants’ counterclaim in either suit. Robin had admitted during cross-examination

</div>  that KK Asia was responsible under clause 2(e) of Annex A to the revised PFA for 300 m/t orders (see [80]).  The counterclaim in the first suit is frivolous and absurd. KK Asia was obliged to provide three months’ forecast of what tonnage was required at the end of every month, while item 2 merely gave examples of what Forest Fibers and KK Asia had to do. Even if the examples in item 2 applied, it behove KK Asia to supply 300 m/t of the total 1,500 tonnage for four territories set out therein.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As for the second suit, the counterclaim against Forest Fibers was for US$153,217.60 for workmanship, US$285,871.22 for total loss of banana film and defective goods, US$58,027.77 for detention and demurrage charges and US$25,100 for shipping charges. Again there was no evidence to support any of the claims.

In this regard, US$30,000 was disbursed on 15 July 2015 while the Lohs acknowledged in clause 3.5 of the SSA dated 9 July 2015 that there was a loan for US$120,000 (rounded up from US$119,578.05)   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The plaintiffs are awarded final judgment against the defendants jointly and severally in the sums of US$24,894.19 and RM4,850 with interest at 5% per annum from 30 December 2016 until payment, pursuant to clause 3.5 of the SSA being 50% of the sums advanced to KK Asia (see [35]) less US$9,700 plus RM9,700.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Although clause 9.9 of the SSA provides “<span class="font-italic">the parties agree that any costs awarded by the Courts shall be on an indemnity basis”</span>, the plaintiffs’ closing and reply submissions made no mention of costs.
