The AR held that <span class="font-italic">all</span> correspondence between Ho and Zheng during the subsistence of their marriage was protected against disclosure under s 124(1) of the EA. HC/RA 245/2022 was the plaintiff’s appeal against the AR’s decision. I allowed the appeal in part and dismissed it in part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 HC/RA 246/2022 and HC/RA 247/2022 were appeals by Zheng, CTE Automobile, Alpha Refrigeration and Central Automotive.

[I]t is virtually impossible and impractical to ‘<span class="font-italic">slice and dice</span>’, as counsel submitted, the communications between two persons to distil the communications from A to B, without also retaining some of what B might have said to A which A paraphrased or repeated to B.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The AR also relied on <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital Investments Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd and others </span>[2017] SGHCR 15 (“<span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>in which a different AR said that “s 124 embraces <span class="font-italic">all</span> communications, ranging from the most quotidian of daily banalities to the deepest intimacies, and must include matters relating to the ordinary business affairs of the spouses” [emphasis in original] (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Before me, the plaintiff submitted that the language in s 124(1) was clear; it expressly referred to communications made <span class="font-italic">to</span> the person who had to give disclosure. The defendants, understandably, supported the AR’s decision. The defendants submitted that Parliament does not legislate in vain (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney</span><span class="font-italic">-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38]) and argued that the plaintiff’s interpretation would render s 124(1) otiose if an applicant sought disclosure against both spouses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I disagreed with the AR and the defendants. In my view, it was unarguable that s 124(1) of the EA only protected a person from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">to </span>him by his spouse during marriage; it did not protect communications made <span class="font-italic">by</span> him to his spouse during marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 First, the ordinary meaning of the language in s 124(1) of the EA was clear. The first step in a purposive interpretation of a legislative provision is to ascertain all the possible interpretations of the provision (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [37]). In my view, the plaintiff’s interpretation was the <span class="font-italic">only </span>possible interpretation. Section 124(1) referred expressly and specifically to communications made <span class="font-italic">to</span> the person who had to give evidence or disclosure. The defendants’ interpretation could not be supported without reading additional words into s 124(1) and it was not the court’s role to re-write legislative provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Second, the plaintiff’s interpretation that s 124(1) protected only marital communications made to the person against whom disclosure was sought, was well-supported by authorities. The history of s 124 was discussed in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>at [16]–[22]; in summary, it is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At common law, a person was not a competent witness either for or against his or her spouse.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The <span class="font-italic">Second Report of the Commissioners for Inquiring into the Process, Practice and System of Pleading in the Superior Courts of Common Law</span> (1852) recommended that spouses should be competent and compellable to give evidence for and against each other but there should be a rule of privilege that safeguarded marital communications. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The recommendations were accepted. The Evidence Amendment Act 1853 (c 83) (UK) (“UK Amendment Act 1853”) abolished the common law rule and made husbands and wives competent and compellable witnesses in civil proceedings. Section 3 of the UK Amendment Act 1853 provided for marital communications privilege as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">III Husbands and Wives not compelled to disclose Communications.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No Husband shall be compellable to disclose any Communication made to him by his Wife during the Marriage, and no Wife shall be compellable to disclose any Communication made to her by the Husband during the Marriage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The legislative developments in the UK led to similar reforms in India in 1853, which formed the basis for s 122 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (Act No 1 of 1872) (“Indian Evidence Act”). Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act provided as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">122. Communications during marriage</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No person who is or has been married shall be compelled to disclose any communication made to him during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married; nor shall he be permitted to disclose any such communication, unless the person who made it, or his representative in interest, consents, except in suits between married persons, or proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Section 124(1) of the EA is based on s 122 of the Indian Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Both s 3 of the UK Amendment Act 1853 and s 122 of the Indian Evidence Act protected a witness from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">to </span>him by his spouse during marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 UK courts have observed that s 3 of the UK Amendment Act 1853 protected communications made <span class="font-italic">to</span> the witness and did not protect those made <span class="font-italic">by</span> the witness: <span class="font-italic">Shenton v Tyler</span> [1939] Ch 620 (“<span class="font-italic">Shenton</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 628–629; <span class="font-italic">Rumping</span><span class="font-italic"> v Director of Public Prosecutions</span> [1964] AC 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Rumping</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 859. A similar observation was made by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in England in its <span class="font-italic">Eleventh Report: Evidence (General)</span> (Cmnd 4991, 1972) at para 173 (cited in <span class="font-italic">Lim Lye Hock v Public Prosecutor</span> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [42]). The plaintiff’s interpretation of s 124(1) was consistent with the interpretation that has been given to s 3 of the UK Amendment Act 1853.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The plaintiff’s interpretation was also supported by the view expressed in Ho Hock Lai, “Spousal Testimony on Marital Communication as Incriminating Evidence: <span class="font-italic">Lim Lye Hock v PP</span>” [1995] SJLS 236 at 240, that “section 124 applies only to communication made <span class="font-italic">to </span>the witness and not to communication made<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">by</span> the witness” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 There was a distinction between the provisions in the UK Amendment Act 1853 and the Indian Evidence Act. Section 3 of the UK Amendment Act 1853 merely provided that no spouse could be compelled to disclose any communication made to him/her by the other spouse during marriage. This meant that the spouse giving evidence could disclose communications made to him by his spouse if he so wished, whether or not the other spouse objected; the marital communications privilege belonged to the recipient-spouse, not the communicator-spouse (see <span class="font-italic">Rumping</span> at 833 and 858). Lord Reid (at 833) found it “a mystery” why this privilege was given to the recipient-spouse, observing that a loyal spouse could use the privilege to help the other spouse, whilst an unfriendly spouse could use the privilege to the detriment of the other spouse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Indian Evidence Act took a different, and perhaps more coherent, approach. Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act also provided that a spouse could not be compelled to disclose communications made to him/her during marriage by the other spouse. However, it went further to provide that a spouse was not permitted to disclose such communications without the other spouse’s consent. Thus, under the Indian Evidence Act, the marital communications privilege belonged to the communicator-spouse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Ho and United SG submitted that this distinction meant that <span class="font-italic">Rumping</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was not helpful in interpreting s 124(1) of the EA. I disagreed. The observation in <span class="font-italic">Rumping</span> (at 859) that s 3 of the UK Amendment Act 1853 did not protect a communication made by a witness to his/her spouse was not related to the observation that the witness could waive the protection without the other spouse’s consent. There was also nothing in <span class="font-italic">Shenton</span> to suggest that the observation (that the statutory privilege did not protect communications made <span class="font-italic">by</span> the witness) was based on anything other than the fact that that was what the provision stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Third, I agreed with the plaintiff that the statement in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span> that s 124 embraced all communications (which the AR relied on) had to be read in context. The issue in that case was whether the scope of s 124(1) was limited to confidential communications between spouses. <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>decided that s 124(1) of the EA was not confined to confidential communications but “embrace[d] <span class="font-italic">all</span> communications” (at [34]). Nothing in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>dealt with the question of whether a person could rely on s 124(1) to refuse disclosure of communications made <span class="font-italic">by</span> him to his spouse; this was not the issue in that case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Fourth, the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff’s interpretation of s 124(1) would render it otiose assumed that both spouses would be available as witnesses in court or that disclosure of documents could be sought against both spouses. Obviously, this assumption did not necessarily hold true in every case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As for the argument that it may be virtually impossible and impractical to “slice and dice” communications between two spouses, in my view, the difficulty was not insurmountable and any difficulty in doing so was insufficient to override what s 124(1) of the EA clearly and expressly spelt out to be the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I therefore found that Ho was not protected by s 124(1) of the EA from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">by </span>him to Zheng during their marriage, and Zheng was not protected from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">by</span> her to Ho.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The scope of communications between spouses that fell within s 124(1) of the EA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As stated earlier, s 124(1) of the EA protected a person from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">to</span> him by his spouse during marriage. The plaintiff submitted that this applied only to communications made by the spouse as principal and that communications made by the spouse as agent for a third party were not protected under s 124(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Pritchard Lilia</span> [2022] SGHC 201 (“<span class="font-italic">Enjin</span>”), in which the High Court held at [41] that communications between spouses fell within s 124 of the EA only if they were made between them in their capacities as spouses as principals. The High Court explained as follows (at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… thus, where a spouse communicated with a spouse on behalf of another person, the section would not apply. In such cases, the communication would be by the spouse’s principal, rather than by the spouse. Section 124 EA would not apply because it only applies to communications ‘by any person to whom [the spouse] is or has been married.’ One example of such a case may arise where two spouses work for different companies that do business with each other. If the wife acting for her employer offers to purchase something from the husband’s employer, and conveys this offer to her husband, the conveyance of that offer to her husband is not a marital communication. It is a communication between the spouses’ respective employers that happens to take place via the spouses. Another example arises where two spouses work for, or are officers of, the same company. They may communicate with each other in circumstances where the communication is part of the company’s business and forms part of the company’s record. Take the case where the two spouses are the only directors of that company. The minute kept by one of them of a board meeting held between them without others present, or a communication between them approving the entry by one of them into a contract with a third party on behalf of the company, would not be protected by marital communications privilege. Those would be records of the company or communications between the company and either spouse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Ho and United SG submitted that the interpretation in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Enjin</span> should not be adopted because (a) it read additional words into s 124(1) of the EA; and (b) it resulted in an unworkable or impracticable result in that it would be difficult to separate communications between Ho and Zheng in their capacities as spouses, from communications between them made on behalf of other entities. I disagreed with the submissions by Ho and United SG.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 First, in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span>, the court was interpreting the words “by any person to whom he or she is or has been married” in s 124(1) of the EA (see <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41]). The court held that where a spouse communicated on behalf of another person, that communication would be by the spouse’s principal rather than by the spouse. Such a communication did not fall within s 124(1) of the EA since s 124(1) only applied to communications by a spouse. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did not involve reading additional words into s 124(1) of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, I accepted that difficulties may arise in separating communications made between spouses in their capacities as spouses from communications that are made as agents for third parties. However, in my view, any such difficulty was not insurmountable and was not good enough reason not to apply <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In this regard, a similar difficulty exists in the case of legal professional privilege. Documents may contain information that is protected by legal professional privilege as well as information that is not so protected. That difficulty has not stopped the courts from allowing disclosure of the information that is not protected by legal professional privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The remaining defendants (Zheng, CTE Automobile, Alpha Refrigeration and Central Automotive) accepted that the interpretation in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>appeared consistent with the rationale behind s 124(1) of the EA as explained in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23], in that it would not jeopardise the frankness and candour in marital communications nor lead to domestic dissension and unhappiness. However, they submitted that <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span> applied only where the communicator-spouse <span class="font-italic">intended </span>to communicate with the recipient-spouse as an agent on behalf of a third party <span class="font-italic">and</span> the recipient-spouse understood the communicator-spouse to be so communicating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 <span class="font-italic">Enjin </span>excluded spousal communications from s 124(1) of the EA where it could be said that the communication was made as an agent of a third party. I agreed with the submission that for <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to apply, the communicator-spouse must have intended to make the communication as an agent on behalf of the third party. In almost all cases, this intent would likely have to be inferred. In my judgment, such an inference may be drawn where, for example: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) both spouses were employees, officers or agents of the same company and the communication was on matters relating to the company’s business;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) both spouses were employees, officers or agents of different companies and the communication was on matters relating to the business between the companies; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the communication had been copied to others in the company or companies that the spouses were employees, officers or agents of; however, the mere fact that a copy of an e-mail may have been kept in the server(s) did not mean that it had been copied to others in the company or companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I agreed with <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span> (at [41]) that records kept by companies (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, minutes of meetings) fell outside the scope of s 124(1) of the EA. Clearly, such records could not be regarded as spousal communications within the meaning of s 124(1) of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, in my view, it was irrelevant for purposes of s 124(1) of the EA whether the recipient-spouse understood the communicator-spouse to be communicating as an agent. The question with respect to s 124(1) of the EA was simply whether the communication was made by “any person to whom [the recipient-spouse] is or has been married”. In other words, the question was whether the communicator-spouse was communicating as a spouse or as an agent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I now turn to <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span>. As seen earlier, the argument in that case was that s 124(1) of the EA applied only to confidential communications between spouses. It was submitted that confidential communications were those which were induced by the marital relationship, and which would not have taken place but for the existence of the marital relationship between the spouses. On this interpretation, s 124(1) of the EA excluded communications which flowed from the business relationship, as opposed to the spousal relationship, between a husband and wife (the “business transaction exception”). The argument relied on three American cases, which the AR distinguished (at [27]–[28]) on the ground that the relevant provisions on marital communications privilege considered in those cases protected the disclosure of “a <span class="font-italic">confidential</span> <span class="font-italic">communication</span> made by one [spouse] to the other during marriage” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The AR in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span> noted (at [28]) that commentators who had considered the English, Indian and Singapore provisions were of the view that the expression “any communication” (in the English and Indian provisions and in s 124(1) of the EA) was wide enough to cover all communications between spouses during the marriage and not just those which were expressed to be confidential. He emphasised (at [30]) that he could not “ignore the determiner ‘any’ in s 124”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I heard the appeal against the AR’s decision in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span>. I was troubled that communications between two directors (who were spouses) regarding the affairs of the company should be protected by marital privilege. Nevertheless, I agreed with the AR’s decision that the business transaction exception did not apply to s 124(1) of the EA and that any reform in that regard had to come from Parliament. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As can be seen from the above discussion, the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was somewhat different from the argument made in <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span>. Having considered the decision in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span> and the parties’ submissions in the present case, I concluded that the interpretation of s 124(1) of the EA in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span> was sound. There was no rule of law or requirement of public policy which precluded the reception in evidence of communications between spouses (<span class="font-italic">Rumping</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 835, 861 and 865). Marital communications privilege existed only to the extent provided for in s 124(1) of the EA, which existed to secure complete privacy in conjugal communications (<span class="font-italic">EQ Capital</span> at [31]). I saw no reason why communications between spouses who work for (or are officers of) the same company or different companies, on matters pertaining to the business/businesses of the company/companies, deserved any protection under s 124(1) of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Accordingly, I decided to adopt the interpretation of s 124(1) of the EA in <span class="font-italic">Enjin</span> and concluded that s 124(1) of the EA did not apply to communications between spouses if the communications were made as agents on behalf of a third party. I agreed with the plaintiff that it was entitled to compel disclosure of communications received by Ho and Zheng, in so far as these communications were made by the communicator-spouse in his/her capacity as an agent rather than as a spouse.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the protection under s 124(1) of the EA could be waived</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Under s 124(1) of the EA, the recipient-spouse could not disclose marital communications made to him without the communicator-spouse’s consent. Clearly, the privilege under s 124(1) of the EA belonged to the communicator-spouse. I agreed with the plaintiff that the protection afforded by s 124(1) of the EA could be waived by the communicator-spouse, such that the recipient-spouse would then be compellable to disclose the communication. Waiver of privilege may be inferred from the communicator-spouse’s conduct, for example, where the communicator-spouse voluntarily made, copied or disclosed the communication to a third party. However, I agreed with the defendants that the mere fact that a copy of an e-mail may have been kept in a third-party’s server, or given to a third party such as a secretary to perform the administrative task of filing, would not amount to waiver of the protection under s 124(1) of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether one could rely on s 133 of the EA to refuse to disclose communications between spouses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Section 133 of the EA states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Production of documents which another person having possession could refuse to produce</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">133.</span> No one may be compelled to produce documents in his or her possession which any other person would be entitled to refuse to produce if they were in his or her possession, except for the purpose of identification, unless such last mentioned person consents to their production, nor may anyone who is entitled to refuse to produce a document be compelled to give oral evidence of its contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It is not necessary to resort to s 133 of the EA unless the party against whom production of documents is sought has no other ground on which he can refuse production. In addition, s 133 applies only to the production of documents and oral evidence as to the contents of such documents whereas s 124(1) is not so limited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As stated earlier, s 124(1) of the EA did not protect Ho from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">by </span>him to Zheng. Similarly, it did not protect Zheng from being compelled to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">by </span>her to Ho. It was not disputed that Ho or Zheng may still have had copies of his/her communications to the other. This was not surprising especially with the prevalent use of e-mails and instant messaging (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, text messages and WhatsApp). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The defendants submitted that pursuant to s 133 of the EA:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Ho could not be compelled to produce communications made <span class="font-italic">by</span> him to Zheng since Zheng would be entitled under s 124(1) of the EA to refuse to produce the same if they were in her possession.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Zheng could not be compelled to produce communications made <span class="font-italic">by </span>her to Ho since Ho would be entitled under s 124(1) of the EA to refuse to produce the same if they were in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The Defendant Companies could not be compelled to produce communications between Ho and Zheng since each of them would be entitled under s 124(1) of the EA to refuse to produce communications made to him/her by the other, if they were in his/her possession.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The plaintiff submitted that with respect to communications <span class="font-italic">by</span> Ho to Zheng, Ho could not rely on s 133 of the EA unless:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Zheng was the owner of the document in Ho’s possession; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Zheng had an independent basis to refuse production of the document.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff made similar submissions with respect to Zheng’s reliance on s 133.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The parties’ submissions raised the following questions:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Whether s 133 of the EA applied only to a situation where the person, against whom production was sought, held a privileged document on behalf of the owner of the document?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b)  Whether a spouse could rely on s 133 of the EA to refuse production of communications made by him to his spouse, which were in his possession?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Whether a third party could rely on s 133 of the EA to refuse to produce communications made between spouses, which were in its possession?</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether s 133 of the EA applied only to documents held on behalf of the owner of the document</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The plaintiff submitted that s 133 of the EA applied only where the person (against whom production of documents was sought) held the documents as agent for the owner of the documents. The plaintiff relied on the following passage in Sudipto Sarkar and VR Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span><span class="font-italic"> on Evidence (In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Ceylon, Malaysia and Singapore) </span>vol 2 (Wadhwa and Company, 15th Ed, 1999) (“<span class="font-italic">Sarkar on Evidence</span>”) at p 2056:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… s 131 [of the Indian Evidence Act] refers to documents of another person in the possession of the witness, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, documents which though physically in the possession of the witness are the property of another person who has a right to object to their production. It extends to the agent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the possessor of the document, the same privilege which is enjoyed by the person whose property it is.

An exception applies when the ‘other person’ consents to the production of the document(s). The section also provides that a person who is entitled to refuse to produce a document under this rule cannot be compelled to give oral evidence of its contents. The scope of this section is considered to be limited to the situation in which a person officially holds a privileged document on behalf of another person; for example, a trustee, a solicitor and a mortgagee. The effect of the provision is that while the person in possession of a document is not obliged to disclose it, he is not prohibited from revealing it if this is his intention. Section 133 is also considered in the context of privileged documents which fall into the hands of third parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, in <span class="font-italic">Asplenium Land Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Lam Chye Shing and others</span> [2019] 5 SLR 130 (“<span class="font-italic">Asplenium</span>”) at [130], the High Court expressed reservations about the statement in <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>that s 133 applied only to a situation where a person officially held a privileged document on behalf of another person. The court observed that no authority was cited for this proposition and reasoned that the opening words of s 133 (“No one …”) were broad and unqualified. The court applied s 133 even though there was no official entrustment of documents to the person against whom production of the documents was sought. It should be noted however that in that case, the parties did not argue that s 133 was not applicable by virtue of the absence of official entrustment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I agreed with <span class="font-italic">Asplenium</span>. Neither <span class="font-italic">Sarkar on Evidence </span>nor <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> cited any authority for the proposition expressed in those publications. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Asplenium</span>, the language in s 133 of the EA was broad and unqualified. Limiting it to situations involving entrustment of documents required reading additional words into the provision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a spouse could rely on s 133 of the EA to refuse production of communications made by him to his spouse</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As stated earlier, a communicator-spouse could not rely on s 124(1) of the EA to refuse to disclose communications made <span class="font-italic">by</span> him to the recipient-spouse. I was of the view that a communicator-spouse also could not rely on s 133 of the EA to refuse disclosure of such communications based on the argument that the recipient-spouse would be entitled under s 124(1) to refuse disclosure of such communications. Allowing the communicator-spouse to do so was inconsistent with s 124(1) itself. In effect, it would allow the communicator-spouse to rely on s 124(1) indirectly to refuse disclosure of communications that he could not have refused to disclose under s 124(1). In my view, s 133 of the EA had to be interpreted in a manner that was consistent with s 124(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Accordingly, Ho could not rely on s 133 of the EA to refuse to produce communications made by him to Zheng, on the ground that Zheng could refuse to disclose such communications under s 124(1).
