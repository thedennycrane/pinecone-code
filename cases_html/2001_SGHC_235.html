<p align="justify">Introduction</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">    The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to a total of four

charges. They were for driving whilst under disqualification, an offence under s 43(4) of the Road

Traffic Act (Cap 276), driving whilst not being covered by insurance, an offence under s 3(1) of the

Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks &amp; Compensation) Act (Cap 189), failure to wear a seat belt

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 He was sentenced on 30 April 2001, to a total of eight months imprisonment,

and a total of 18 years disqualification for all classes of vehicles, a total fine of $1,000, in

default, ten days imprisonment. The appeal against the sentences of imprisonment and

disqualification before this Court was dismissed on 2 August 2001. Counsel for the applicant,

immediately after the dismissal, sought for an order that the applicant commence serving his

sentence of imprisonment on 16 August 2001, so that the appellant could have a period of two weeks

to settle his personal and work affairs. I granted it and also ordered that the applicants bail

be extended.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 This Motion, filed on 16 August 2001, and heard on 17 August 2001, was for a

further order that the applicants sentence of imprisonment which was to commence on 16 August

2001, be postponed instead to commence on 30 August 2001. The applicant cited in his affidavit, that

he needed a further two weeks to settle his personal and work affairs, before serving his sentence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The applicant was seeking, in essence, an alteration of my order of 2 August

2001 that the applicant surrender himself and commence serving his sentence on 16 August 2001. I

dismissed the application.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Functus Officio</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 I shall first deal with the issue of whether I could lawfully substitute my own

order, some two weeks after it had been made. Section 217 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)

provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">217. Judgment not to be altered</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) No court other than the High Court, when it has recorded its judgment,

    shall alter or review the judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) A clerical error may be rectified at any time and any other mistake may

    be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I ruled in <i>Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor </i><nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 445</nobr> at 460, that

s 217 did not attempt any substantive enactment with regard to the High Court. The phrase other

than the High Court could be interpreted to suggest that s 217 allowed the High Court to alter or

review its judgment. However, to regard so would mean that the High Court would never be functus

officio since, in theory, there would be nothing to prevent a third judgment or a fourth judgment to

supplement an earlier judgment. This would go against the universal principle of law that, when a

matter has been finally disposed of by a court, the court is, in the absence of a direct statutory

provision, functus officio and cannot entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless and until

the previous order of final disposal has been set aside.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 This provision, and its equivalent, has spawn different interpretations. The

previous s 369 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">No court, other than a High Court, when it has signed its judgment, shall alter

  or review the same, except as provided in ss 395 and 484 or to correct a clerical error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Despite the express exclusion of the High Court from the operation of this

provision, many Indian High Courts held that they had no implied power to alter or review their own

judgment. In <i>Re Gibbons </i>14 ILR (Cal) 42 at 47, Petheram CJ stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In my opinion the effect of the words other than a High Court is

  precisely the same as if in place of them the Legislature had at the end of the section added

  these words this section does not apply to the High Court. There is no substantive enactment

  in that section with reference to the High Court, and all it does is to reserve the powers which

  existed in the High Court before, so that they are in no degree taken away. What the powers of the

  High Court were before it is unnecessary to consider, but whatever they were, they were reserved

  and they were in the same position after this section was passed as they had been in before; and

  inasmuch as it is not shown to us that, before the passing of this section, any power of revision

  existed in the High Court, that section did not, in my opinion, create any such power, and

  therefore, it appears that this section does not help the applicant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 This was cited with approval by Spenser-Wilkinson J in <i>Public Prosecutor v

Heng You Nang </i><nobr>[1949] MLJ 285</nobr>, a criminal appeal from Sessions Court. In this case, the Public

Prosecutor had applied against the acquittal of the respondent on charges connected with the alleged

importation of certain goods by the respondent. The appeal was dismissed. Subsequently, the Deputy

Public Prosecutor applied by motion that the court should hear further arguments and review its

judgment. Spenser-Wilkinson J referred to s 278 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Malaysia, that

provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">No Court, other than a Court of a Judge, having once recorded its judgment,

  shall alter or review the same: provided that a clerical error may be rectified at any time, and

  that any other mistake may be rectified at any time before the Court rises for the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">and stated that</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[the case of <i>Re Gibbons</i>] lays down the correct principle  that once a

  judgment in a criminal matter has been pronounced and signed it cannot be altered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This was significant, as Spenser-Wilkinson J, I think quite rightly, decided not

to follow the judgment of McElwaine CJ in <i>Goh Ah San &amp; 2 Ors v The King </i><nobr>[1938] MLJ 95</nobr>.

Spenser-Wilkinson J said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[In]  <i>Goh Ah San &amp; 2 Ors v The King </i><nobr>[1938] MLJ 95</nobr>,  McElwaine

  CJ having in open court dismissed the appeal of one appellant and allowed those of the other two

  subsequently, when he came to give his reasons therefor, allowed the appeal of the 1<sup>st</sup>

  appellant. The relevant portion of his judgment is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">This No 1 accused was not represented on the appeal before me, and when I

    dismissed his appeal, and though I had read the record, I did not appreciate the weakness of the

    case against him. I have had some doubts whether I am now <b>functus officio</b>, but no

    certificate of the result of the appeal has yet been prepared. I stated I would give my reasons

    for my decision, and now, having come to a conclusion favourable to the accused person I think I

    am justified in applying the principle in <b>Jones v Williams </b>41 JP 614 (referred to in <b>Rex

    v Manchester Justices- Ex parte Leaver </b>53 TLR 687) and in regarding myself as not <b>functus

    officio</b>. I therefore allow the appeal of No 1 accused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is to be observed that part of the learned Chief Justices decision was

  reached without hearing any argument upon the point and there is a possibility that this decision

  might not have been the same had his power to act as he did been seriously contested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 <i>Re Gibbons </i>and <i>Public Prosecutor v Heng You Nang </i>were cited with

approval, by the Supreme Court of Malaysia in <i>Ooi Sim Yim v Public Prosecutor </i><nobr>[1990] 1 MLJ 88</nobr>. Here, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges, for possession of a firearm and

ammunition. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to ten years imprisonment and six strokes of

whipping on the first charge and another three years on the second charge and ordered that both

terms of imprisonment are to run consecutively from and be backdated to the date of his arrest.

About two and a half months after the disposal of the case, the trial judge issued a corrigenda to

substitute the original order with a new one which had the effect of making both sentences run

consecutively, i.e. the appellant was to serve a total of 13 years imprisonment to take effect

from the date of his arrest. The appellant appealed against the order, contending that the two

sentences should run concurrently. Mohamed Azmi SCJ ruled that s 278 of the Criminal Procedure Code

of Malaysia did not empower the trial judge to substitute his judgment two and a half months after

it was recorded and delivered. As the judgment he gave was equivocal and capable of two

interpretations, the basic principle of criminal justice should apply in that the construction more

favourable to the appellant should be adopted rather than the substituted order subsequently made by

the trial judge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 However in <i>Wong Hong Toy </i>&amp; <i>Anor v Public Prosecutor </i><nobr>[1994] 2 SLR 396</nobr> at 408E, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the learned Wee Chong Jin CJ disagreed

with these authorities and instead, said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A plain reading of [s 217] shows that the High Court can alter or review its

  judgment. There is no reason to compel a restrictive interpretation, especially since we are

  concerned with a superior court of record, which is also the highest court of trial in criminal

  cases. We must give effect to the plain meaning of the words in the section. To ignore the words

  other than the High Court would be to render them otiose. In our opinion, [s 217] gives

  sanction to Lai Kew Chai J to alter the fine. It was necessary for him to do so to correct a

  mistake as to the maximum fine that could be imposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 In <i>Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor </i><nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 445</nobr> at 460, I agreed

with the approach taken by Petheram CJ in <i>Re Gibbons </i>and Spenser-Wilkinson J in <i>Public

Prosecutor v Heng You Nang </i>and Mohamed Azmi SCJ in <i>Ooi Sim Yim v Public Prosecutor</i>. With

respect and great deference, I departed from Wee Chong Jin CJs reasoning in <i>Wong Hong Toy.</i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 I took the opportunity in <i>Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor </i>to say at

 68:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">..upon a true construction of s 217, I did not think that it attempted any

  substantive enactment with regard to the High Court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">and at  69:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">.. In my view, the entire [s 217] might be read as if it did not apply to the

  High Court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, as I also said at  76 and 77:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">.. the powers conferred on the lower courts by s 217 must, by implication, also

  be available to the High Court in its appellate capacity Consequently, [the High Court has] the

  requisite power in altering the sentence of the appellant in the instance case, even though it was

  a substantive mistake, because it had not arisen for the day when the rectification was made. On

  this approach, it was also apparent that Lai Kew Chai J had the necessary powers to reduce the

  fine in the case of <i>Wong Hong Toy </i>since the mistake there was rectified before the court

  rose for the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 I made the order of 2 August 2001, allowing the applicant a period of two

weeks to settle his personal and work affairs, and commence serving his sentence on 16 August 2001.

To accede to this application would, in essence, entail altering my own order of 2 August 2001. With

my approach to s 217, as can be seen from the reasoning in <i>Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor</i>,

once the order is regarded as a judgment, I could not lawfully substitute my own order, some

two weeks after it had been made. It is thus necessary that I go on to consider if my order of 2

August 2001, allowing the applicant a period of two weeks to settle his personal and work affairs,

comes within the definition of judgment.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Judgment</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 The word judgment is not defined in the Criminal Procedure Code. The

Halsburys Laws of England, Hailsham Ed, Vol IX, paras 260-265 explains it as a final order in a

trial terminating in the conviction or acquittal of the accused. In <i>Chhotey Lal v Tinkey Lal </i>(1935)

AIR 815, the court regarded that an order in the nature of a judgment is one which is passed on full

enquiry and after hearing both parties.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 In <i>Re Balasundara Pavalar </i>(1951) AIR Mad 7, an order on a bail

application was regarded as nothing more than an interlocutory and tentative expression of the

conclusion as to whether a person should be set at large pending trial, or disposal of his appeal

and cannot be termed a judgment so as to attract the application of s 369 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure of India. Menon J stated that [(1951) AIR Mad 7 at 12]:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A judgment is one which finally acquits or convicts an accused person and any

  other order passed by an appellate court disposing of the appeal would include an order of remand

  or retrial. But it cannot be said that an order passed by an appellate court would include an

  interlocutory rejection of an application for bail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 Thus, by using the proper approach of analogy from decided cases from other

appropriate jurisdiction, an application to ask the court to exercise its discretion, that the

applicant defer serving his sentence, ought not to be treated as a judgment. Such an order cannot,

by any stretch of imagination, be regarded as a final order in a trial terminating in the conviction

or acquittal of an accused. The High Court, as an appellate court, has the power to review its own

such previous order.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 However, this still leaves the issue of when and in what circumstances the

High Court would consider a further extension of time before serving the sentence. It would be

impossible to lay down a clear-cut guideline. It is possible that during the period of extension,

the applicant may suffer from illness which necessitates treatment in hospitals or other places

where better facilities are available. It might be that a further extension would be justifiable as

the applicants close relative or a member of immediate family happened to suffer from serious

illness. Different conditions and circumstances could arise that would necessitate or justify an

order of further extension of time before serving the sentence. Ultimately, the court would be

guided by whether the interests of justice require that discretion be exercised to allow the

applicant a further period of time before he serves his sentence. At the same time, the court must

take a robust approach and ensure that the discretion not be abused by frivolous requests from the

applicant. The burden is always on the applicant to show and explain that the circumstances and

conditions are of such a dire and serious nature or of such urgency that they merit the exercise of

discretion by the court to grant a further period of time before he serves his sentence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 Thus, I concluded that the application for a further period of time before

serving the sentence of imprisonment is not a judgment. Therefore, there is nothing in law to

prevent the court which passed it from re-considering it or from entertaining a fresh application

for the same relief. However, in the circumstances, there was nothing in the applicants affidavit

that showed a valid reason for the court to exercise its discretion the second time to allow him a

further period of time, before serving his sentence. I thus dismissed the motion.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 Section 217(1) lays down a general prohibition against alteration of judgments

by the Subordinate Courts. Section 217(2) is an exception to this general prohibition, by

prescribing the limited circumstances, in which the Subordinate Courts could alter or review their

judgments. Rectifications by Subordinate Courts under s 217, could go beyond mere accidental slips

and omissions, the only restriction being that it must be corrected before the court rises for the

day, i.e. before the working day of the court ends. And as the powers conferred on the lower courts

by s 217 must by implication also be available to the High Court in its appellate capacity, the High

Court has such power to rectify the judgment, again, provided that it has not arisen for the day.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 I had decided on 2 August 2001 to grant an order that the commencement of the

applicants sentence begin on 16 August 2001. And faced with the present application on 17 August

2001, although I was not functus officio, and not deprived of the power to accede to the application

and alter my own decision of 2 August 2001, the applicant failed to come up with any valid excuse

for the court to exercise its discretion the second time to allow him a further period of time,

before serving his sentence.</p>
