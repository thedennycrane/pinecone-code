Order 18 r 19(1) of the ROC 2014 is the predecessor provision for O 9 r 16(1) of the ROC 2021 (addressing the striking out of pleadings). However, there is no directly equivalent provision to O 41 r 6 of the ROC 2014 (which addresses the striking out of affidavits) (see <span class="font-italic">Re X Diamond Capital </span>at [13]), in place of which there is now O 9 r 16(4) and O 15 r 25 of the ROC 2021 (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rules of Court – A Practice Guide (2023 Edition) </span>(Chua Lee Ming editor-in-chief) (Academy Publishing, 2023) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Rules of Court – A Practice Guide</span>”) at para 15.215). For convenience, O 18 r 19(1) and O 41 r 6 of the ROC 2014 read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Striking out pleadings and endorsements (O. 18, r. 19)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19.—(1)  The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Scandalous, etc., matter in affidavits (O. 41, r. 6)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.  The Court may order to be struck out of any affidavit any matter which is scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On a preliminary note, I observe that O 15 r 25 of the ROC 2021 makes no direct reference to the striking out of affidavits. Rather, the provision simply stipulates what an affidavit must and must not contain – <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> that an affidavit must contain only relevant facts, and must not contain “vulgar or insulting words unless those words are in issue in the action” or “anything that is intended to offend or to belittle”. In my view, the principles enshrined in O 15 r 25 may be subsumed within the wording of O 9 rr 16(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021, which provide respectively that the court may order an affidavit to be struck out on the ground that it is an abuse of process or it is in the interests of justice to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 While there are some differences between O 9 r 16(1) of the ROC 2021 and O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC 2014, they have the same effect, with the exception of O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) replacing O 18 rr 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2014 to incorporate the Ideals as set out in O 3 r 1 of the ROC 2021, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to do what the interests of justice require: <span class="font-italic">Tiger Pictures Entertainment Ltd v Encore Films Pte Ltd </span>[2023] SGHC 255 at [16], citing <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rules of Court – A Practice Guide </span>at para 09.051. Although they have not been retained under the ROC 2021, O 18 rr 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2014 have effectively been subsumed under O 9 rr 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021 (see Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice </span>(LexisNexis, 2023) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 9.16.2, 9.16.2A and 9.16.6). Pleadings (or parts thereof) which are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or which may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action, may be struck off as being either an abuse of process or against the interests of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Overall, the authorities pre-dating the ROC 2021 remain relevant in assessing the merits of a striking out application under the ROC 2021: <span class="font-italic">Leong Quee Ching Karen v Lim Soon Huat and others </span>[2022] SGHC 309 at [23], citing <span class="font-italic">Is</span><span class="font-italic">kandar bin Rahmat and others v Attorney-General and another </span>[2022] 2 SLR 1018 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat</span>”) at [17]–[19] and <span class="font-italic">Eurogreen Building Products Private Limited v Savourer Pte Ltd </span>[2022] SGMC 53 at [13]. For present purposes, it suffices to summarise the Court of Appeal’s holdings in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat</span> as regards the “abuse of process” and “interests of justice” grounds under O 9 rr 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the inquiry into what constitutes an abuse of process of the court includes considerations of public policy and the interests of justice, and signifies that the process of the court must be used <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and properly and must not be abused; the court will prevent improper use of its machinery and the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat </span>at [18], citing <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”) at [21]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the “interest of justice” ground gives effect to the court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice, such as where the claim is plainly or obviously unsustainable (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat </span>at [19], citing <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati 5 </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">These principles likewise apply to O 9 rr 16(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021, which adopt identical language to O 9 rr 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, O 9 rr 16(1) and 16(4) of the ROC 2021 are expressed in broader terms than O 18 r 19(1) and O 41 r 6 of the ROC 2014. In particular, the “interests of justice” ground under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) has been noted to be “a new provision which has no precedent … is residuary in nature and is intended to empower the court to terminate [an] action or dismiss a defence or make any other appropriate order if this outcome is necessary to achieve the interests of justice” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice </span>at para 9.16.6).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Nevertheless, the grounds of “abuse of process” and “interests of justice” under O 9 r 16 of the ROC 2021 should not be construed too widely. An overly liberal interpretation of the grounds under O 9 r 16 may invite a deluge of striking out applications and appeals arising out of these applications. The various rules and procedures under the ROC 2021 must be read and understood in light of the Ideals under O 3 r 1, which emphasise, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, fairness, efficiency, and practicality in court processes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Ideals are “akin to constitutional principles by which the parties and the Court are guided in conducting civil proceedings”: see Civil Justice Commission (“CJC”), <span class="font-italic">Civil Justice Commission Report </span>(29 December 2017) (Chairman: Justice Tay Yong Kwang) at para 3. Indeed, under O 3 r 1(3), it is mandatory for the court to seek to achieve the Ideals in all its orders and directions. While the CJC in formulating the Ideals recognised that all of the Ideals may not be achieved in every case – for example, “fair access to justice” in a certain case may be at odds with “expeditious proceedings” – the Ideals are to be applied conjunctively, as dictated by the circumstances of each case, and they serve as a guide to the court, rather than a formula to be followed: see Ministry of Law and the New Rules of Court Implementation Team, <span class="font-italic">Response to Feedback from Public Consultation on the Civil Justice Reforms: Recommendations of the Civil Justice Commission and the Civil Justice Review Committee </span>(11 June 2021) (Chairman: Justice Ang Cheng Hock) at para 16. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 To give effect to the Ideals in the context of striking out applications, the court should only allow striking out or expunging of irrelevant material where doing so would serve a broader purpose. Examples include removing scandalous allegations, substantially reducing the time and costs of trial or further proceedings, or preventing collateral attacks on the parties or their witnesses. This approach would best balance and effectuate the Ideals of fairness, efficiency, and practicality. If irrelevancy were the only criteria, parties might be encouraged to engage in satellite litigation over any material alleged to be irrelevant on matters peripheral to the case. That would cause delays in court proceedings, inefficiency in the use of court resources and an increase in costs, which would be contrary to the Ideals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 O 9 r 16, as well as O 15 r 25’s stipulation that an affidavit “must contain only relevant facts” (which as noted above at [14] may be subsumed within O 9 rr 16(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021), should be read in light of these observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I now apply these principles to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Offending Materials are irrelevant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Deng did not challenge, or offer contrary evidence to, AET’s case that he had taken possession of the Diamonds and did not respond to AET’s written demand that they be returned. The crux of the dispute was whether:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) AET owned the Diamonds, having purchased them from XDC; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) as pleaded in the Defence, XDC had only loaned the Diamonds to AET on the instructions or request of Wu and/or Ms Samantha, and AET was accordingly not entitled to their return.

Even if Wu was in control of AET or was otherwise able to influence it to commence proceedings against XDC, and even if it was beneficial to Wu for AET to bring this claim, that is not sufficient to establish a triable issue or some other reason for trial, particularly given Deng’s inability or failure to respond to the material issues.

</div> Deng offered no explanation as to how this action was still being used to “stifle XDC”, particularly as it was against him personally and not XDC. That Deng continues to argue the relevancy of the Offending Materials when the basis of his alleged concern has ceased to exist only underscores how contrived his arguments are. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Offending Materials should be expunged</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Offending Materials are not only irrelevant but are also of an offensive and scandalous nature, such that striking out is justified. The Offending Materials essentially seek to cast aspersions on Wu, Ms Samantha, and the management of Metech. They are relied on to show that Ms Samantha and the management of Metech are under the control and influence of Wu, who is neither a director nor a majority shareholder of the company. This implies that Ms Samantha and the management of Metech are not properly discharging their duties as officers of Metech and AET. Further, the Offending Materials assert, or are relied on to assert, that Wu is using his control and influence to cause AET to “fabricate” and pursue this action against XDC to stifle its claim against him in OC 9. This is a serious allegation of impropriety and breach of fiduciary duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Likewise, the allegation of a personal relationship between Wu and Ms Samantha is completely irrelevant and scandalous. In this regard, the adducing of the Email is particularly egregious and revealing of Deng’s motives. It was, on Deng’s own case,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Reply Affidavit of Deng Yiming (12 Jul 2023) (“DY-1”) at para 12.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> sent by an <span class="font-italic">anonymous </span>person and contained material which he could neither verify nor confirm. Its contents are completely unreliable. Indeed, Goh JC had in OA 148 (<span class="font-italic">Re X Diamond Capital</span> at [19]) ruled it to be inadmissible hearsay evidence, albeit in a different statutory context from the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I note that hearsay evidence contained in affidavits filed in applications for summary judgment is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>admissible – O 3 r 5(7) of the ROC 2021 provides that in all applications to the court in an action (which includes applications for summary judgment), supporting affidavits “may contain statements of information or belief with their sources and grounds clearly stated”: see <span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd v Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 885 (“<span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee</span>”) at [93], discussing the similar O 14 r 2(8) of the ROC 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, the sources and grounds for hearsay evidence must be <span class="font-italic">clearly stated </span>under O 3 r 5(7). As observed in <span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee </span>at [90], the phrase “sources and grounds” in provisions enshrining exceptions to the rule against hearsay refers to “sources for the information [deposed to]” and “[the deponent’s] grounds for the beliefs [deposed to]”. In respect of the Email, Deng states that his source is an “anonymous sender” and he provides no further grounds to support his belief in the contents of the Email.

</div> This cannot be considered as a statement of his sources and grounds for belief in respect of the Email. In this regard, Deng is relying on the Email for the <span class="font-italic">truth of its content</span>, and not to prove that it was received – hence, clearly stated “sources and grounds” for his belief are required, without which there is no basis for the information he seeks to rely on. Thus, the Email is inadmissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, the real purpose of the Offending Materials is to attack the characters of, and embarrass, Wu, Ms Samantha and/or the boards of Metech and AET, whether as an end in itself or to distract from the fact that Deng had no real defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Expunging the Offending Materials therefore serves the legitimate purpose of removing not just irrelevant material, but material which has been included to advance a collateral purpose of attacking or embarrassing Deng’s adversaries. It is clearly in the interests of justice to expunge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I also find that it is an abuse of process for Deng to include and rely on the Offending Materials, particularly as they had previously been expunged in OA 148. Deng’s argument that the issues in that application are “distinctly different” is a hollow and specious attempt to justify the unjustifiable, and a cynical excuse to continue his personal agenda.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, I make no order with respect to striking out paragraph 5 of Deng’s Defence. I note that the striking out of pleadings has more serious consequences than the striking out of affidavits (<span class="font-italic">X Diamond Capital </span>at [14]), and it is “only in plain and obvious cases” that this power should be invoked (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span> at [18]). In any event, all that paragraph 5 pleads is that Wu was a controller of Metech, AGT and AET and that Ms Samantha was appointed CEO of Metech and to the board of Metech, AGT and AET on Wu’s recommendation. While AET may disagree with those assertions, there is nothing inherently objectionable about them. They were also pleaded in response to paragraph 5 of AET’s Statement of Claim, which, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, introduced Metech and AGT, and pleaded that Ms Samantha was a director of both. It was therefore presented in the Defence as part of the factual background to the dispute. None of the other Offending Materials were pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 AET argues that paragraph 5 of Deng’s Defence was a “Trojan horse” which allowed the other Offending Materials to be introduced. But this acknowledges that the pleading is simply irrelevant without more. It is not in the interests of justice to strike out pleadings, which, on their face, do nothing more than briefly plead background facts. The expunging of the other Offending Materials is sufficient to deal with the mischief which AET complains of. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I therefore grant AET’s application to expunge the Offending Material save in respect of paragraph 5 of Deng’s Defence. Deng is to refile the relevant affidavits and submissions with the relevant Offending Material removed or redacted. The 1st Xu Affidavit is to be expunged in its entirety.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I also order the sealing of the affidavits filed in respect of SUM 1991. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I shall hear parties on costs. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hri Kumar Nair J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yam Wern Jhien, Bethel Chan Ruiyi and Tan Li Jie Stanley (Setia Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Zhulkarnain bin Abdul Rahim, Sean Chen Siang En, Shermaine Lim Jia Qi and Cheong Wei Wen John (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
