class="font-weight-bold">Introduction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 This case concerns two applications to set aside two related arbitral awards on the specific ground that the arbitral tribunal which heard both disputes lacked jurisdiction because there were no concluded contracts, and hence, no valid arbitration agreements between the parties. It arose from rather peculiar circumstances. At all times, the plaintiff was well aware of the arbitration. However, it initially elected to ignore the various arbitration notices and procedural orders by the tribunal altogether. It also refused service by courier of the pleadings and documents in relation to the arbitration which thereafter necessitated the engagement of Chinese lawyers to effect the service. Just before the commencement of the arbitration hearing, the plaintiff belatedly decided to take some interest in the arbitral process. It sought to obtain the same documents which had previously been served. It claimed to have difficulty locating the documents due to “an unavoidable internal handover” and its “network server’s problem”. It also appointed solicitors who wrote to the tribunal to seek an extension of time to file its submissions to challenge the tribunal’s jurisdiction. When the tribunal replied that the hearing would proceed as previously ordered with liberty to the plaintiff to apply for an adjournment at the commencement of the hearing, the plaintiff decided that it would not be able to attend the hearing as “there is little time for preparing to travel to Singapore”. As a consequence, it elected to limit its participation in the arbitration by submitting a brief letter to challenge the tribunal’s jurisdiction. The tribunal proceeded with the hearing and, having found that the contracts had indeed been concluded between the parties, assumed jurisdiction to hear both disputes. After due consideration of the evidence, it issued the two arbitral awards in favour of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff now seeks to present arguments which should rightly have been raised before the tribunal. Although the arguments strictly deal with the merits of the defendant’s claims as regards the existence of the two concluded contracts, the plaintiff should be entitled to advance them since the determination of this issue would have a direct bearing on the tribunal’s jurisdiction. However, having nailed its colours to the mast in asserting that there were no valid arbitration agreements because there were <span class="font-italic">no signed contract</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> between the parties, can the plaintiff pursue other arguments to challenge the existence of the concluded contracts or should it stand or fall from such election? This decision will examine the scope and nature of the court’s role in its <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> review of the tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction. In undertaking this <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> review, should the court be confined to examine the tribunal’s decision with reference only to the evidence before the tribunal?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff, Jiangsu Overseas Group Co., Ltd (“Jiangsu”), is a company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. Its business includes, among other things, the import and sale of raw materials such as steel, timber and chemicals.

Liu had asked about the shipment schedule, and for Herlene to provide him with the “selling price formula” by that day.

The three shipments of 20,000 metric tons each were to be shipped to Tianjin, China. Herlene attached a contract for the three shipments for Liu’s signature, and proposed to send the contract for the “balance 3 cargoes” once the details had been finalised.

In respect of the balance five cargos (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, under the Term contract), Concord pressed Jiangsu to load the August shipment and to issue the LC.

The award of such arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Two sub-issues arose in connection with Clause 19: first, whether the requirement under s 2A(3) of the IAA that an arbitration agreement be in writing (the “in-writing requirement”) was satisfied, and second, whether compliance with the condition precedent in Clause 19 – for the parties to settle the disputes amicably before referring the dispute to arbitration – was necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The tribunal ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear both Arbitration Nos 54 and 55. First, based on the negotiations between Jiangsu and Concord, as well as their “affirming conduct”, the tribunal found that there was a concluded and binding contract for one shipment, the terms of which were evidenced by the provisions of the Spot contract, and a concluded and binding contract for five shipments, the terms of which were evidenced by the provisions of the Term contract. Therefore, the in-writing requirement was satisfied for the arbitration agreements under the Spot and Term contracts. Second, the tribunal held that the condition precedent in Clause 19 was not enforceable.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I dismissed the applications. In my view, there must be good reasons beyond the existence of factual disputes to allow oral evidence and cross-examination. The court, in deciding whether to set aside an arbitral award, is fully competent to sift through the transcripts of oral evidence before the tribunal (see <span class="font-italic">AQZ</span> <span class="font-italic">v ARA</span> [2015] 2 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">AQZ</span>”) at [54]). I agree with the view expressed by Judith Prakash J that the existence of substantial disputes of fact as to whether a party had entered into the relevant arbitration agreement is not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> a sufficient reason to allow oral evidence and/or cross-examination (<span class="font-italic">AQZ </span>at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Nor is it a sufficient reason that, in this case, Jiangsu was not represented before the tribunal. Allowing the arbitration to proceed in its absence was entirely Jiangsu’s own choice and doing. Jiangsu would have had the chance to cross-examine Herlene and other material witnesses had it participated in the arbitration hearings. Ample notices and reminders were sent to Jiangsu. Having deliberately chosen not to do so, they should stand or fall by that strategy. I was also mindful that findings of fact by the tribunal are generally indisputable and, consequently, cross-examination is generally not resorted to in applications under O 69A of the ROC (see <span class="font-italic">Beijing </span><span class="font-italic">Sinozonto Mining Investment Co Ltd v Goldenray Consortium (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 1 SLR 814 at [52]). Besides, there is a substantial body of objective evidence including the exchange of correspondence between the parties to assist the court to determine this factual inquiry. The objective evidence speaks for itself. I did not think that cross-examination would be helpful in the limited context of the setting aside applications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Nevertheless, I granted Jiangsu’s alternative prayers for leave to file additional affidavits to deal with two specific points: (a) the minutes of the two meetings at Jiangsu’s office on 18 July 2013 and 8 August 2013; and (b) Jiangsu’s internal regulations for approving contracts with third parties. As explained in [63]–[71] and [89] below, I considered the fresh documentary and affidavit evidence adduced by Jiangsu for the purposes of the hearing though ultimately I did not find them to be material or relevant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Jiangsu’s application to set aside the Awards</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Jiangsu’s applications to set aside the Awards were based on s 24 of the IAA read with Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration set out in the First Schedule of the IAA (“Model Law”). Article 34(2) of the Model Law provides that an arbitral award may be set aside if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  the party making the application furnishes proof that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) a party to the arbitration agreement referred to in Article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of this State… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It is open to a party seeking to set aside an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration agreement was invalid to argue that no arbitration agreement was formed between them. This is because “the question of the existence of an arbitration agreement can be subsumed within the issue of the validity of an arbitration agreement” (see <span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v </span><span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal </span>[2014] 1 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">First Media</span>”) at [156]). There, the Court of Appeal was referring to Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law, which is a ground for refusing enforcement of an arbitral award, but its holding applies with equal force to a setting-aside application brought under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) given that both provisions are similarly worded. This was also the view adopted by Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">AQZ</span>, where she followed <span class="font-italic">First Media</span> and accepted that an applicant can seek to set aside an award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) on the basis that no valid arbitration agreement had been formed (at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Jiangsu’s argument that there was no valid arbitration agreement because it had not concluded the Spot or Term contracts with Concord therefore falls within the rubric of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Standard of review </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It is uncontroversial that, in an application to set aside an arbitral award on the ground that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the dispute, the court undertakes a <span class="font-italic">de novo </span>hearing of the arbitral tribunal’s decision on its jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">AQZ</span> at [49]). If the arbitration agreement is contained in the contract itself, and the validity of the arbitration agreement is challenged on the basis that no binding contract had been concluded, the validity of the arbitration agreement and the existence of a binding contract “stand or fall together” and the court can determine <span class="font-italic">both</span> issues on the basis of a full rehearing (see <span class="font-italic">Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. Ltd v Americas Bulk Transport Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 470 (Comm) at [35]–[36]). In determining whether the tribunal lacked jurisdiction, the tribunal’s own view of its jurisdiction has no legal or evidential value to the court (<span class="font-italic">First Media</span> at [163]), though this should not be taken to mean that “all that transpired before the [t]ribunal should be disregarded, necessitating a full re-hearing of all the evidence”, only that there is no fetter on the court’s fact-finding abilities (<span class="font-italic">AQZ</span> at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Jiangsu sought to adduce evidence to rebut the tribunal’s finding that the Spot and Term contracts had been validly concluded. As will be referred to later, this included Jiangsu’s internal regulations that contracts for multiple shipments needed board approval, which would allegedly go towards demonstrating that Jiangsu could not have entered into such a contract with Concord for six shipments. Having elected not to participate in the arbitration proceedings despite numerous reminders, should Jiangsu be precluded from putting forth such evidence which could and should have been brought before the tribunal? Counsel for Concord, Mr Jeya Putra, did not object to the <span class="font-italic">admissibility</span> of Jiangsu’s fresh evidence though he reserved his position as regards both weight and relevance. But I raised this question to both counsel at the start of the hearing because I thought this issue merited closer examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Whether there is any bar to adducing new evidence before a court tasked with reviewing an arbitral tribunal’s finding on jurisdiction is a question which has met with somewhat differing views in recent cases. In Singapore, two decisions of the High Court appear to have taken different positions. In <span class="font-italic">Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic v </span><span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments Ltd</span> [2015] 2 SLR 322<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Sanum</span>”), the court rejected the notion that a party has full latitude to adduce new evidence. I should observe that <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span> involved a challenge to an arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction though not in the context of a setting-aside application. The plaintiff referred the issue of the tribunal’s jurisdiction to the High Court under s 10 of the IAA and sought a declaration that the arbitral tribunal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the claims brought by the defendant. In support of this, it applied to adduce two diplomatic letters which had not been adduced before the tribunal. The defendant objected to their admission on the basis that they had not satisfied the conditions of admissibility in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> [1954] 1 WLR 1489. Edmund Leow JC noted that although the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> principles did not strictly apply, a party did not have “full unconditional power to adduce fresh evidence at will” (at [43]–[44]). Applying a modified <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test, he held that fresh evidence would only be admitted if: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the party seeking to admit the evidence demonstrated sufficiently strong reasons why the evidence was not adduced at the arbitration hearing;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the evidence if admitted would probably have an important influence on the result of the case though it need not be decisive; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the evidence had to be apparently credible though it need not be incontrovertible.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On the facts, all three conditions were satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the other hand, Prakash J observed in <span class="font-italic">AQZ</span> that there was nothing in O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC to restrict parties from adducing new materials which had not been placed before the arbitrator (at [59]). She held that O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) only required an applicant seeking to set aside an award to file an affidavit setting out the supporting evidence. Delay in adducing fresh evidence did not preclude its admissibility though it might affect the weight to be given to it, in addition to adverse costs orders (see [59], referring to <span class="font-italic">Electrosteel</span><span class="font-italic"> Castings Ltd v Scan-Trans Shipping &amp; Chartering Sdn Bhd </span>[2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 190). However, her comments were strictly <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> because in that case, there was in fact no attempt to rely on fresh evidence (at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The English decision in <span class="font-italic">Central Trading &amp; Exports Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Fioralba Shipping Company</span> [2014] EWHC 2397 is also germane to this issue. It involved a challenge to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal under s 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK). Having reviewed a series of decisions, Males J arrived at the conclusion that a court would not normally exclude relevant and admissible evidence even if it might cause prejudice to the other party in the context of a challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction (at [29]). He found that a party’s right to adduce evidence would be subject to the court’s control <span class="font-italic">via</span> the rules of procedure, and that such control would have to be exercised in accordance with established principles, “in particular the overriding objective and the interests of justice” (at [30]). A court did not have “unfettered discretion” to exclude relevant evidence, but might refuse to allow a party to produce documents selectively where that would prejudice the other party or if the evidence did not comply with the court’s rules for ensuring that evidence is presented in a “fair manner” (at [32]). In this regard, any failure by the parties to comply with the tribunal’s procedural orders on disclosure of documents might be a relevant consideration (at [33]). On the facts, Males J declined to allow the claimant to rely on evidence which it had failed to produce in response to the tribunal’s disclosure orders (at [41]). He also declined to allow evidence, such as hearsay evidence, which would not have been admissible under the English Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (at [44]–[47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The cases above illustrate that in the context of a setting-aside application, there appears to be no<span class="font-italic"> absolute</span> rule to exclude the admission of fresh evidence. The court has the discretion to rule on its admissibility or attach the appropriate weight to such evidence, and/or to make an adverse costs order against the applicant. However, it is important to bear in mind that the jurisdictional challenges in those cases arose from <span class="font-italic">contested </span>arbitration proceedings. Should the same principles apply in the context of an uncontested arbitration in circumstances where the applicant who seeks to adduce fresh evidence had deliberately elected not to participate in the entire arbitral process? This is an interesting point. Since this point was not actively argued by the parties and more importantly, since Mr Jeya Putra did not object to the admissibility of the fresh evidence adduced by Jiangsu, it is perhaps prudent to leave this point to be decided when the issue is properly contested in a subsequent case. I should add that the appeal against the decision in <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(which applied a modified <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test) is currently pending decision by the Court of Appeal. No doubt, this issue will receive some explicit exposition when the decision is eventually handed down by the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I will now address the merits of Jiangsu’s challenge proper.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable law as regards the validity of the contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For the purposes of a challenge under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law, the validity of the arbitration agreement is to be determined by “the law to which the parties have subjected it”, failing which it is to be determined by “the law of this State”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the law of Singapore (see s 3(2) IAA). The first limb applies the parties’ choice of law. The second is a default rule mandating the application of the law of the forum where the award is sought to be set aside. It applies only “in cases where the parties have neither expressly nor impliedly chosen the law governing the arbitration clause” (see Gary B. Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span><span class="font-italic">Vol III </span>(Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial </span><span class="font-italic">Arbitration</span>”) at 3201). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Neither Concord nor Jiangsu disputed that Singapore law is the applicable law to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement. That having been said, it may be useful to understand the proper basis for the application of Singapore law in this case – whether by the parties’ choice of law or by default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Concord submitted that where parties are in dispute as to the existence (or validity) of a contract, the dispute is to be construed in accordance with the law of the putative contract – the law of the contract as if it were valid.

</div> Concord relied on the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our opinion, a distinction ought to be drawn between a case where the parties are agreed that there is no agreement at all, and a case where the parties are in dispute as to the existence or validity of the agreement (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, due to fraud or misrepresentation). It is settled principle that, in the latter situation, the dispute as to the existence or the validity of the contract would be construed in accordance with the law that governs that contract as if the contract were valid … Such a rule makes good practical sense because otherwise it would mean that a mere allegation on the part of the defendant that there was fraud would suffice to neutralise the effect of the jurisdiction or choice of law clause in the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It has been observed that “a choice-of-law agreement is effective to select the law governing the arbitration agreement under [Article] 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) … even if the validity or existence of any agreement between the parties is denied” (Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> at 3200). An arbitration agreement is typically separable from the main contract – it is an agreement “independent of the other terms in the contract” (Article 16(1) of the Model Law). Ordinarily, therefore, if the main contract is invalidated by some vitiating factor, the arbitration agreement (and in this case the choice of law clause) is not invalid unless the vitiating factors directly impeach on the validity of the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Here, I would observe that Jiangsu and Concord never disputed the existence of Clause 19. It encompasses both the choice of Singapore law and the arbitration agreement. This clause was the very same clause which featured in the 6 June contract as well as the Spot and Term contracts. In substance, Jiangsu was denying any agreement to accept the six shipments of petroleum coke; it was not denying any intention to be bound by Clause 19. Significantly, when Jiangsu accepted the September shipment, it was content to use the Spot contract which likewise contained Clause 19. It is clear that the validity of the arbitration agreement is to be determined by Jiangsu and Concord’s choice of Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I turn therefore to examine whether the arbitration agreements were valid under Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contractual validity under the applicable law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I understood Jiangsu to be challenging the existence of the Spot and Term contracts on two discrete grounds: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Jiangsu did not reach any oral agreement with Concord for the purchase of the six shipments as evidenced by the Spot and Term contracts. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and in any event, there could not have been any oral agreement for the six shipments as this was contrary to Jiangsu’s internal rules and regulations, which Concord was aware of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I will address the arguments in reverse order since, when asked what her strongest argument was, Ms See Tow submitted that it was the second.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jiangsu’s internal regulations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 There are two “internal rules and regulations” which Jiangsu relied on (collectively “the internal regulations”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The internal regulation requiring approval by senior management</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Liu alleged in his affidavit filed on 24 March 2016 that under Jiangsu’s Regulations on the Execution of Business Contracts (“the approval regulations”),

</div> I note that this alleged regulation is not supported by any documentary evidence. Rather, Jiangsu merely asserted that it had been their “practice” to have separate contracts to govern each shipment of goods. In this regard, Jiangsu relied on the fact that for the 2012 shipments, a separate contract was concluded for each shipment.

This is because both contracts had their genesis in an agreement for six shipments, which was contrary to the single-shipment regulation. Further, Liu would have exceeded his authority in entering into the Spot and Term contracts, either because he did not obtain the requisite approval forms, or because his mandate was limited to entering into a contract for a single shipment at a time. These arguments in essence suggest that Jiangsu was under some “incapacity” at the time the contracts (and therefore the arbitration agreement) were entered into.

</div> Unless Concord was aware of them, the internal regulations would operate as no more than the subjective reservations of Jiangsu as to whether it could have intended to conclude the contracts with Concord. Such subjective reservations cannot deny the existence of a contract if, to all outward appearances, the parties have concluded the contracts (see [76] below). Furthermore, under Singapore law, even if Liu had acted outside his scope of authority, Jiangsu would still be bound by the contracts unless Concord had notice of Liu’s lack of authority (see <span class="font-italic">Banque</span><span class="font-italic"> Bruxelles Lambert and others v Puvaria Packaging Industries (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 736 at [21]–[22] and Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 7-086).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Therefore, the internal regulations would only assume relevance if Concord was cognisant of them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Concord was not aware of the internal regulations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69  In my view, Jiangsu is incorrect in alleging that Concord was aware of the internal regulations. First, there is simply no mention of the internal regulations in the correspondence between Jiangsu and Concord from May 2013 to November 2013. Nor is there any evidence that Herlene, who also negotiated the 2012 contracts, was aware of the approval forms at that time, which might make her failure to request such approval for the 2013 contracts questionable. There is also neither any factual nor legal basis for Jiangsu to suggest that because a separate contract was entered into for each of the 2012 shipments, it must follow that Jiangsu is somehow precluded by the internal regulations from entering into a contract for multiple shipments. As explained in [72] below, the evidence is to the contrary. Interestingly, the very first correspondence for this transaction began with an inquiry from Jiangsu for six shipments.  Consistent with the initial inquiry, the subsequent correspondence between the parties in the period May–November 2013 also proceeded on the basis that Liu had the authority to contract for six shipments on behalf of Jiangsu. He was after all an Assistant General Manager of Jiangsu.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Jiangsu sought to rely on Herlene’s witness statement in the arbitration in aid of its submission. Herlene recounted that, on or around 17 July 2013 when Concord had not yet received Jiangsu’s LC for the Spot contract, Liu informed her that Jiangsu’s management could not “approve a letter of credit with a US$5 million limit without an onbuyer in place.”

</div> I fail to see how this could possibly assist Jiangsu to make good its case that Concord was aware of the internal regulations <span class="font-italic">at the time when the contracts were entered into</span>. First, this information was only mentioned to Herlene on 17 July 2013 <span class="font-italic">after</span> Concord had sent Jiangsu the Spot and Term contracts. Second, it purported to explain Liu’s difficulty in obtaining approval for the LC. This is in fact consistent with the conclusion of the Spot and Term contracts. Why would Liu be seeking approval for the LC if there were no concluded contracts? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It did not escape my attention that Jiangsu conspicuously omitted to mention the internal regulations at the meeting of 18 July 2013 or 8 August 2013. If the internal regulations precluded such transactions or if Liu had failed to comply with the internal regulations or had no such authority, the meetings would have been the perfect setting to raise them particularly at the 18 July 2013 meeting which was attended by both the President and General Manger of Jiangsu. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Even if there was any restriction on the part of Liu to enter into the contracts for multiple shipments, it should not be assumed that Liu did not have the requisite authority to do so. In fact, the evidence before me suggests otherwise. Right from the outset of the negotiations on 23 May 2013 (see [5] above), multiple shipments were expressly contemplated in the email which emanated from Jiangsu’s broker. Further, throughout the entire negotiation process, multiple shipments were repeatedly mentioned and yet at no time did Liu hint that multiple shipments in a single contract were not permitted or that he had no such authority under Jiangsu’s internal regulations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Finally, at the meetings at Jiangsu’s office on 18 July and 8 August 2013, Jiangsu expressly acknowledged that it had contracted for six shipments in a single contract but requested the contract to be split into the Spot and Term contracts (see [88]–[89] below). These admissions by Jiangsu at the two meetings effectively demolished the allegation that Liu had no authority or that multiple shipments in a single contract were not permitted under the internal regulations. There is simply no merit or legal content whatsoever in Jiangsu’s ill-conceived reliance on the internal regulations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the parties concluded the Spot and Term contracts  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It may be useful to set out again Concord’s case on the two concluded contracts. Concord claimed that it had entered into an oral agreement on or about 30 May 2013 with Jiangsu for the sale and purchase of six shipments each of 20,000 metric tons of petroleum coke for shipment from Dumai, Indonesia to various ports in China. Initially, the transaction was to be split into two contracts, with three shipments of 20,000 metric tons each. This structure changed on or about 6 June 2013 into the 6 June contract for all six shipments. Finally, on or about 15 July 2013, at the request of Jiangsu, the structure underwent a further change, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the six shipments were split between the Spot contract and the Term contract. The Spot and Term contracts were reduced to writing and sent to Jiangsu for signature by an email dated 15 July 2013. It is common ground that Jiangsu did not sign either the Spot or Term contracts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Under Singapore law, an objective test is to be applied in deciding whether the parties have reached an agreement. In applying this objective test, the language used by one party, whatever his real intention may be, is to be construed in the sense in which it would be reasonably understood by the other (see <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The objective intention of the parties can be gleaned from their correspondence and relevant background, which includes the industry the parties are in, the character of the document containing the terms, and the course of dealing between the parties (see <span class="font-italic">R1 International Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Lonstroff AG </span>[2015] 1 SLR 521 (“<span class="font-italic">R1 International</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]). It follows that the subjective reservations of one party as to whether it is contractually bound cannot prevent the formation of a contract if, to outward appearances, parties have reached an agreement (see <span class="font-italic">Aircharter</span><span class="font-italic"> World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 440 at [30] and <span class="font-italic">Lim Koon Park and another v Yap Jin </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Bryan and another </span>[2013] 4 SLR 150 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Koon </span><span class="font-italic">Park</span>”) at [66]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 If parties are involved in continuing negotiations, it may be less useful to analyse the existence of the agreement in terms of whether an offer was made and accepted. It may be more appropriate to examine the whole of the documentary evidence and decide whether the parties did reach an agreement on all material terms (see <span class="font-italic">Projection Pte Ltd v The Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 798 at [16], following <span class="font-italic">Port Sudan Cotton Co v </span><span class="font-italic">Govindaswamy Chettiar &amp; Son</span>s [1977] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 5 at 10). If one approaches the issue of contract formation in this holistic manner then it follows, as the Court of Appeal has held, that lack of clarity on the exact circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the contract would not be an impediment to discerning that one was in fact concluded in the course of the parties’ continuing negotiations (<span class="font-italic">Lim Koon Park</span> at [75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Another important principle is that as long as there is “a set of essential terms which the parties may be bound by as a matter of law and on the basis of which they may act”, a contract may be formed even if parties are still negotiating some of the terms in the contract (<span class="font-italic">R1 International</span> at [52]). The crucial question is whether the parties, by their words and conduct objectively ascertained, have demonstrated that they intend to be bound despite the unsettled terms (see <span class="font-italic">Rudhra</span><span class="font-italic"> Minerals Pte Ltd v MRI Trading Pte Ltd (formerly known as CWT Integrated Services Pte Ltd)</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1023 at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">That Jiangsu did not sign the Spot and Term contracts does not prevent their formation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I should first dispose of Jiangsu’s initial defence to the claim, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Jiangsu did not formally indicate its assent by signing the Spot and Term contacts. The non-signing of the contracts cannot in itself be a bar to the formation of contract, for “the sterile formality of a signature is not always necessary in law to breathe life into contractual undertakings” (see <span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [55]). In <span class="font-italic">R1 International</span>, the Court of Appeal found that the fact that a party did not counter-sign and return the contract note did not mean that the unsigned contract note was not contractually binding (at [76]). Jiangsu’s allegation that it would not consider itself bound until its company seal had been applied fails for the same reason. Here, Jiangsu had refused to sign the Spot and Term contracts because it had not received any confirmed purchase orders from its own customers.

</div> Jiangsu had accepted three shipments but there was a possibility that it might not agree to the remaining three shipments (see [6] above). Hence, there may well have been a concluded oral agreement on 30 May 2013 for three shipments but perhaps not for six shipments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The correspondence between the parties did not end with Concord’s email of 31 May 2013.

The preamble to this contract clearly stated that Concord had “concluded the deal” with Jiangsu on 30 May 2013 and 6 June 2013. Further, and consistently with this, in Herlene’s internal update, she reported that Jiangsu had “confirmed the 6 cargoes” (see [7] above). Jiangsu said it would reply on 13 June 2013. At this point there is a gap in the email chain. Although it may not be possible to point to a precise moment when Jiangsu indicated its assent to the 6 June contract, its conduct after that date is entirely consistent with the inference that it had indeed given its assent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Jiangsu’s conduct after 6 June 2013 is consistent with the 6 June contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The following instances of Jiangsu’s conduct are consistent with the conclusion of the 6 June contract (see [8]–[9] above) </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 17 June 2013, Jiangsu’s broker sent an email to advise Concord on the laycan dates for the first two shipments.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 21 June 2013, Jiangsu informed Concord of the delivery date for the second shipment.

A reasonable person in Concord’s position would regard Jiangsu’s conduct as indicating that it intended to be bound by the 6 June contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In my judgment, the intention on both sides to be bound by the 6 June contract was still present when, on 15 July 2013, Concord sent the Spot and Term contracts for Jiangsu’s signature. Jiangsu had requested that the first shipment be governed by a single contract and the remaining five be governed by another contract. Concord acceded to Jiangsu’s request. The Spot and Term contracts superseded the 6 June contract and became the final landing point of the contractual arrangement for the six shipments. It bears mention that the Spot and Term contracts were the contracts which formed the subject matter of the arbitrations. However, as noted above at [10], the essential terms such as the quantity of each shipment, the quality of the petroleum coke, and the price had already been agreed, and remained the same throughout. Significantly, an amended LC was resent on 15 July 2013. As noted at [11] above, the contract reference number for the LC was in fact the Spot contract reference number: 1306/PDT/TERM/T144771. This supports Concord’s case that the 6 June contract was split into the Spot and Term contracts on 15 July 2013 at the request of Jiangsu to facilitate the issuance of the LC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The two meetings between Jiangsu and Concord confirm the existence of the oral agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As alluded to at [12] and [17] above, two meetings were held in Jiangsu’s office to discuss the status of the six shipments. It is of note that the meeting on 18 July 2013 was preceded by (a) a letter dated 17 July 2013 from Concord that Jiangsu was in breach of the Spot contract; and (b) an email dated 18 July 2013 from Concord to Jiangsu setting out the agenda for the meeting which included Jiangsu’s “clear position for the first shipment”, Jiangsu’s “steps to prepare the letter of credit” and Jiangsu’s advice as regards the “balance 4 cargoes”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The salient points which were discussed at the 18 July 2013 meeting have been summarised at [12] above. Jiangsu expressly acknowledged that it had “contracted [for] 6 cargoes in total” with Concord. It is indeed very telling that Jiangsu proposed to bear US$10 per metric ton as compensation to Concord. Given the volume of the contracted cargo, this would effectively translate into a proposal by Jiangsu to bear US$800,000 to US$1,200,000 of the losses.

</div> At the very least, even if the proposed compensation was only for the Spot contract, it would still be a substantial sum of US$200,000. There is no reason why Jiangsu would propose this generous compensation unless it accepted that it was bound by, and liable under, the Spot and/or the Term contracts. Liu’s explanation was that although Jiangsu was not contractually bound to accept the first shipment, it offered to bear the loss to “maintain the cordial business relationship” between the parties.

</div> Such an offer strikes me as highly improbable in the commercial context between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 At the meeting on 8 August 2013, Jiangsu admitted that it was liable to Concord under the Spot contract, and was taking steps to perform the Term contract (see [17] above). Further, consistent with the 18 July 2013 meeting, at the 8 August meeting, Jiangsu again acknowledged its difficulty to pay Concord’s claim for the Spot contract “at one go” and instead proposed compensation “via subsequent cargoes loading August to December” under the Term contract. It also proposed to Concord to “vary the premium for the cargoes loading in different months to reflect prevailing market conditions”, instead of having the same premium “apply for all 5 cargoes”. The purpose of this proposal was to average the premium to “+ 120”, which can only be a reference to the contract price (PACE + US$120) under the Term contract. To my mind, Jiangsu was attempting to ensure that the contract price for each of the five remaining shipments would approximate the contract price under the Term contract because it acknowledged its obligation to perform all five shipments under the Term contract. Jiangsu was trying to vary the terms of the Term contract. Crucially, Jiangsu informed Concord that the proposal to “vary” the premium came from its end customer, “Surun”. This indicated that Jiangsu was trying to vary the terms of the contracts with Concord in order to comply with the requests from its own end customer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The two meetings plainly showed that Jiangsu accepted that it was contractually bound to take delivery of the six shipments, as much as it tried to persuade Concord to release it from four of the shipments under the Term contract by offering some compensation. Liu claimed that, at the two meetings, he denied that Jiangsu had agreed to the six shipments.

</div> But both Liu and Zhang Xuexiang signed the minutes of the 18 July meeting. Notably, no denial of the Spot and Term contracts was recorded. In fact, it was the very opposite – the minutes recapped how Jiangsu had contracted for six shipments in a single contract at first but requested the contract to be split into the Spot and Term contracts (see [12] above). Moreover, it was Liu himself who sent the notes of the 8 August meeting to Herlene and Gary. It is certainly not open to Jiangsu to disclaim its own recording of the discussion at the 8 August meeting. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Jiangsu accepted the September and November shipments pursuant to the Term contract </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 There is no dispute that Jiangsu accepted and paid Concord for two shipments of petroleum coke each of 20,000 metric tons in September and November 2013. Undoubtedly, these shipments would have been made in performance of some contracts. According to Concord, these two shipments were part of the Term contract while Jiangsu claimed that they were shipped pursuant to two separate contracts independent of the Term contract. These are the two competing case theories for the acceptance of the two shipments. It must follow that if Jiangsu is unable to prove that there were two other contracts which were distinct from the Term contract, it stands to reason that the two shipments must have been performed pursuant to the Term contract which would in turn render it clear beyond peradventure that the Term contract was concluded between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 When Jiangsu wrote to the tribunal on 29 October 2014 to challenge the jurisdiction of the tribunal, it claimed that the contracts for the September and November shipments were the only two contracts which it had entered into with Concord. Although the contract reference numbers were provided to the tribunal, these two alleged contracts were not attached to the letter. Implicit in its letter to the tribunal is that it denied entering into the Spot and Term contracts with Concord. Liu, in his affidavit filed on 12 August 2015, claimed to have faxed the contract for the September shipment to Concord on 29 August 2013.

</div> Concord denied ever receiving these two alleged contracts. When pressed at the hearing whether Jiangsu was able to produce the fax transmission reports or any other evidence to support Liu’s allegation, Ms See Tow conceded that none could be produced. It is curious for Jiangsu to accuse Concord of deliberately withholding the disclosure of these two alleged contracts to mislead the tribunal, when it omitted to disclose them in its own letter to the tribunal to challenge its jurisdiction.  I find this allegation all the more egregious since there is no evidence that they were ever sent to Concord in the first place.  Accordingly, I reject Liu’s evidence that he had faxed over the alleged contracts for the September and November 2013 shipments to Concord.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It would appear (from [22]–[23] above) that Liu had unilaterally adopted the Spot contract previously sent on 15 July 2013 in order to obtain the LC for the September shipment. As for the November shipment, Jiangsu used the contract dated 10 October 2013 which Concord had sent for Jiangsu’s use in obtaining an LC (see [25] above). Both contracts were solely for the purpose of procuring the issuance of LCs. Jiangsu has exhibited the contracts for the September and November shipments which it claims to have signed and sent to Concord. The September contract is dated 15 July 2013 while the November contract is dated 10 October 2013. These are identical to the contracts it had used to obtain the LCs, save that both contain Jiangsu’s company’s seal and that the 15 July 2013 contract is signed. It seems therefore that Jiangsu signed and applied its seal to these contracts, which it had received for the purpose of opening the LCs, before supposedly sending them to Concord. However, I have found that they were in fact never sent to Concord. In my view, the September and November shipments were accepted pursuant to Jiangsu’s obligations under the Term contract. Even if I am wrong in treating these two shipments as shipments under the Term contract, it does not follow that the shipments were made pursuant to the two separate contracts as alleged by Jiangsu since these two contracts were never sent to Concord. At best, they would be of neutral probative value in deciding between the two competing case theories.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I find that the Spot and Term contracts were validly concluded between Jiangsu and Concord. Consequently, the arbitration agreements (Clause 19) in both contracts were valid and the tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the disputes in respect of Jiangsu’s breaches of the Spot and Term contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I therefore dismiss the applications in OS 730 and OS 731 with costs. As both applications cover the same facts and legal issues, I fix the costs for each application at $10,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed if not taxed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Steven Chong<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">See Tow Soo Ling and Chia Shengyou, Edwin (Colin Ng &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff;<br/>Pancharatnam Jeya Putra and Thuolase d/o Vengadashalapathy (AsiaLegal LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
