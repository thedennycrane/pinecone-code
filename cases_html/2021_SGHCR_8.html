The Property was sold to the Defendant, the late Mr Wee Tien Liang. However, the Defendant failed to complete the sale (“the Abortive Sale”) and the Plaintiffs eventually successfully sold the Property to another purchaser at a lower sale price (“the Successful Sale”). The Plaintiffs brought the present suit against the Defendant, claiming various heads of loss occasioned by the Abortive Sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Liability was entered against the Defendant for the Abortive Sale, with damages to be assessed. However, the Defendant passed away intestate before the trial on the assessment of damages (“the AD Trial”) took place. No letters of administration were made in respect of his estate, and his only contactable next-of-kin declined to be involved in his estate and in the present litigation. This gave rise to a preliminary issue because the framework in the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) did not appear to provide for how the matter may proceed in such a situation. After considering the submissions by Plaintiffs’ counsel and the helpful opinion provided by the Public Trustee’s Office, I exercised the inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court and ordered that the AD Trial proceed in the absence of the Defendant or his personal representative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Following the AD Trial, I awarded damages to the Plaintiffs, assessed at a net total of $242,112.58 (after taking into consideration the Defendant’s deposit of $260,000). I provide, in this judgment, the reasons for my decision on the preliminary issue as well as on the assessment of damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Plaintiffs were the joint owners of the Property. On 1 March 2018, the Plaintiffs issued an Option to Purchase (“the OTP”) to the Defendant. Clause (1) of the OTP stated that the sale and purchase of the Property was subject to the Law Society of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 2012 (“Conditions of Sale”). The sale price was $5.2million, and the sale was to be completed by 21 May 2018. The Defendant paid $52,000 for the OTP. On 15 March 2018, he further paid the option exercise fee of $208,000. The total deposit paid towards acquisition of the Property was therefore $260,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 18 April 2018, the Defendant’s then-solicitors wrote to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors, requesting that completion be postponed to 6 June 2018. On 15 May 2018, the Defendant’s then-solicitors wrote again, requesting a further postponement of completion to 31 August 2018. On 31 May 2018, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors served the Defendant with a notice to complete the sale within 21 days of the notice (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>by 21 June 2018). On 21 June 2018, the Defendant’s then-solicitors again requested an extension of time to complete the sale by 10 September 2018. On 26 June 2018, Plaintiffs’ solicitors replied, indicating that the Plaintiffs had decided not to agree to any variation or extension to complete the sale. The sale was therefore aborted, and the Plaintiffs issued a fresh option to purchase to a new set of buyers on 26 October 2018, at the sale price of $4.8million. The sale of the Property was completed on 11 January 2019 (“the Successful Sale”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural History </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiffs brought the present suit on 11 April 2019, claiming that the Defendant’s failure to complete the sale had resulted in the Plaintiffs suffering loss and damage, including – amongst other things – a reduced sale price. Taking into consideration the deposit of $260,000 paid towards the acquisition of the Property, the Plaintiffs claimed a total net loss of $301,943.33. The Plaintiffs subsequently revised this figure (see [11] below).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 24 June 2019, the Plaintiffs filed an application under O 14 of the Rules of Court (“the Summary Judgment Application”), seeking summary judgment for the sum of $301,943.33 or, alternatively, for interlocutory judgment to be entered against the Defendant with damages to be assessed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Summary Judgment Application was heard on 19 August 2019. At the hearing, Plaintiffs’ counsel urged the court to enter judgment on liability, and to grant certain parts of the quantified claims, while leaving the remaining parts for the AD Trial. In this regard, Plaintiffs’ counsel pointed out that the dispute was as to quantum but not liability. He conceded that there were certain valid points raised by Defendant’s then-counsel in respect of some of the sub-claims, but suggested that the court could order the Defendant to pay the sum of $140,000 up front, being the difference between the loss of sale price (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>$400,000) and the deposit already paid (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>$260,000).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Defendant’s then-counsel resisted the Summary Judgment Application. He argued that there was a possibility that if the Plaintiffs are found not to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate their loss, the Plaintiffs’ claim for the loss of sale price may be less than $400,000. As such, he contended that the court was precluded from granting judgment with damages to be assessed because the court was not in a position to decide whether the Plaintiffs had discharged their duty to mitigate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The court found that (a) the Plaintiffs had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case and produced the necessary evidence in support of their claim for breach and/or repudiation of contract; and (b) the Defendant had failed to raise any triable issue in relation to his liability arising from the breach of contract, the only issues raised being purely those relating to damages. As such, the court granted judgment to the Plaintiffs with damages to be assessed. The court declined to order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiffs the sum of $140,000 upfront because the Plaintiffs’ mitigation of loss was still in issue, and instead ordered that this issue be reserved for determination at the AD Trial. The court also reserved issues of costs to the court hearing the AD Trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiffs subsequently amended their Statement of Claim to take into consideration some of the points raised at the Summary Judgment Application. They claimed a revised total net loss of $303,714.71 (after taking into consideration the deposit of $260,000), quantified as follows: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Loss of sale price of $400,000.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Property agent’s commission arising from the Successful Sale, amounting to $102,720.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Legal fees incurred due to the Abortive Sale, amounting to $2,782. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Bank interest on the mortgage loan incurred by the Plaintiffs from 21 June 2018 to 11 January 2019 (“the Holding Period”), amounting to $20,275.27.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Opportunity cost of earning interests on the proceeds from the sale of the Property (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>$2,625,148), calculated at the interest rate of 1.88% per annum during the Holding Period, amounting to $31,639.87.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) Other incidental losses during the Holding Period, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pro-rated property tax of $4,208.15, mortgage insurance of $552.62 and costs of water and electricity used in the Property of $1,536.80. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The AD Trial was fixed in April 2020. However, the Defendant passed away shortly before the AD Trial was scheduled to take place. Defendant’s then-counsel sought time to obtain instructions from the Defendant’s family, including whether someone would be obtaining letters of administration of the estate.

</div> It turned out that Defendant’s then-counsel was unable to obtain any instructions from the Defendant’s family over an extended period of time. On 21 May 2020, Defendant’s then-counsel informed the court that they were unable to ascertain if anyone would obtain letters of administration of the Defendant’s estate.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 9 September 2020, the Plaintiffs took out an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application under O 15 r 7(2) (“the Substitution Application”) for the Defendant’s brother to be appointed the representative of the Defendant’s estate for the purposes of the proceedings, and for the proceedings to be carried on as if the Defendant’s brother had been substituted for the Defendant. The court ordered that the Substitution Application be served on the Defendant’s brother. The service of papers proved to be a time-consuming task. Plaintiffs’ counsel repeatedly sought adjournments due to his difficulties in effecting service on the Defendant’s brother. At the third hearing of the Substitution Application on 4 January 2021, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the court that he was considering other options such as seeking the consent of the Public Trustee to be appointed in this matter. At the fourth hearing on 1 February 2021, Plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that based on his research, the Public Trustee would not intervene in the present matter, and sought more time to find a solution. At the fifth hearing on 15 March 2021, Plaintiffs’ counsel withdrew the Substitution Application.

</div> He explained that the Rules of Court did not provide for a situation where the defendant had passed away post-commencement of proceedings, where no letters of administration were granted. Given the foundational importance of the preliminary issue and the absence of any adversarial countercheck on the position taken by Plaintiffs’ counsel, I directed Plaintiffs’ counsel to furnish researched submissions to assist the court on the preliminary issue. After considering the submissions, and given the paucity of cited authorities, I directed Plaintiffs’ counsel to seek the opinion of the Public Trustee’s Office on the alleged “large lacuna”. The Public Trustee’s Office provided a helpful and substantive response. In gist, the Public Trustee’s Office opined that there was indeed a “lacuna in the law… which would necessitate the Court [exercising] its inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court, to grant the plaintiffs an order for the assessment of damages hearing in absence of the Defendant or his personal representative”.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Upon careful study of the provisions of the Rules of Court, specifically O 15 rr 6A, 7 and 15 thereof, I agreed with Plaintiffs’ counsel and the Public Trustee’s Office that none of the provisions provided for the situation in the present case. To elaborate: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) O 15 r 6A relates to proceedings against estates. O 15 r 6A(1) deals with a situation where a cause of action “would have lain” against a person, and that cause of action “survives” the death of that person. In such a situation, “the action may, if no grant of probate or administration has been made, be brought against the estate of the deceased”. O 15 r 6A(3) provides that where an action is commenced against a person who was deceased as at its commencement, it “shall be treated… as having been commenced against his estate in accordance with paragraph (1), whether or not a grant of probate or administration was made before its commencement”. Had O 15 r 6A applied to the present case, the Public Trustee could have been appointed to represent the deceased’s estate (see O 15 rr 6A(4) and 6A(6)). However, a plain reading of O 15 r 6A suggests that the rule was intended to apply where the intended defendant is deceased <span class="font-italic">as at the commencement of proceedings</span>; this was, indeed, also the view taken by the Public Trustee’s Office.

</div>
</div>
</div> O 15 r 6A therefore does not directly provide for the present situation where the Defendant was alive as at the commencement of the suit (and, indeed, has already progressed past the finding of liability to the assessment of damages).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) O 15 r 7 relates to a situation where a party’s death occurs <span class="font-italic">after </span>proceedings have already commenced. O 15 r 7(1) provides that where a party to an action dies but the cause of action survives, the action does not abate by reason of the party’s death. O 15 r 7(2) provides that where the interest or liability of a party is “assigned or transmitted to or devolves upon some other person”, the court may order “that other person” to be made a party to the action and the proceedings to be carried on “as if he had been substituted for the first-mentioned party”. In <span class="font-italic">Teo Gim Tiong v Krishnasamy Pushpavathi (legal representative of the estate of Maran s/o Kannakasabai, deceased)</span> [2014] 4 SLR 15, the Court of Appeal emphasised (at [50]) that (i) the effect of O 15 r 7(2) is that “only a personal representative may be substituted for the deceased person”, this being “fundamental to the purpose of the rule”; and (b) the phrase “that other person” refers to the person to whom the interest or liability in the pending proceeding has been “assigned or transmitted to or devolve[d] upon”. O 15 r 7 is inapplicable in the present case because there is no personal representative and no known person upon whom the interest or liability of the Defendant is “assigned or transmitted to or devolve[d] upon”. This was, indeed, the very reason that Plaintiffs’ counsel had withdrawn the Substitution Application.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) O 15 r 15 relates to a situation where a deceased person had an interest in an existing court action but was not a party to that action. This is clear from a plain reading of O 15 r 15(1). It is useful to also refer to <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy v Soo Ah Choy </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 822, where the High Court explained (at [22]) that O 15 r 15(1) was directed at the situation where “after an action had been started and both plaintiff and defendant were litigating it, it became apparent that a deceased person <span class="font-italic">who was neither the plaintiff nor the defendant and thus not a party to the litigation </span>had an interest in the subject matter of the litigation and therefore his estate should be represented in the action” (emphasis added). O 15 r 15 does not apply to the present case because the deceased person is, in fact, the Defendant who is already a party to the litigation. As the Public Trustee’s Office put it, “a plain reading of [O 15 r 15] suggests that it does not apply as this rule facilitates the representation of an estate in a proceeding to which it was, hitherto, not a party”.

During the examination-in-chief, Mr Bauer clarified that the Plaintiffs had inadvertently overstated the claim on property agent’s commission – specifically, the Plaintiffs ought to have claimed only $51,360 (instead of $102,720), being the amount that they had paid as vendors of the Property. As the Defendant was deceased and unrepresented, I posed a series of questions to Mr Bauer. These questions arose from a combination of my queries on the evidence before me as well as arguments raised by Defendant’s then-counsel at the hearing of the Summary Judgment Application.

</div> In the circumstances and for the avoidance of doubt, I order that the Plaintiffs are entitled to forfeit and keep the deposit of $260,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I now turn to address each of the heads of claim in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss of sale price</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Condition 15.10(a) of the Conditions of Sale provides that if on any resale contracted within one year after the scheduled completion date the vendor incurs a loss, the purchaser must pay to the vendor as liquidated damages the amount of such loss. Here, the Successful Sale was completed on 11 January 2019, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, about eight months after the initial scheduled completion date of the aborted sale. As the Plaintiffs suffered a loss of $400,000 (being the difference between $5.2million and $4.8million), Plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that the Defendant had to pay this amount to the Plaintiffs as liquidated damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The main issue that Defendant’s then-counsel had raised at the Summary Judgment Application was whether the Plaintiffs had sufficiently mitigated their losses when selling the Property at $4.8million. Defendant’s then-counsel argued that notwithstanding Condition 15.10(a) of the Conditions of Sale, the Plaintiffs had to discharge their duty to mitigate and had failed to do so (see [9] above). In response, Plaintiffs’ counsel took the position that (a) Condition 15.10(a) of the Conditions of Sale in and of itself contractually entitled the Plaintiffs to the loss in the Property’s sale price, and (b) in any event, the Plaintiffs had reasonably mitigated their losses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Unfortunately, and perhaps because this was not eventually required at the Summary Judgment Application, neither set of counsel fleshed out in detail how the common law duty to mitigate interacted with Condition 15.10(a) of the Conditions of Sale. I therefore directed that Plaintiffs’ counsel address the issue in his written submissions after the AD Trial. Again, Plaintiffs’ counsel merely asserted that the Plaintiffs were contractually entitled (pursuant to Condition 15.10(a) of the Conditions of Sale) to be paid the loss of sale price “regardless of any alleged issue pertaining to the duty to mitigate”,

</div>
</div>  spending the majority of his submissions touching on the law concerning mitigation of loss and his contention that the Plaintiffs had reasonably mitigated their losses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the absence of comprehensive legal arguments on the interface between the common law duty to mitigate and Condition 15.10(a) of the Conditions of Sale, and given the focus of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s submissions, I proceed on the basis that the duty to mitigate applies in the present case. The key legal principles are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the defaulting party must properly plead and prove that the aggrieved party had failed to fulfil his duty to mitigate loss (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Yip Holdings Pte Ltd v v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd </span>[2011] SGHC 227 (“<span class="font-italic">Yip Holdings</span>”) at [23]). In relation to pleadings, the defaulting party has to plead “matters of materiality” relating to the alleged failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate loss, with “as much particularity as would be required in the circumstance” (<span class="font-italic">Yip Holdings </span>at [24]). <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the defaulting party bears the burden of proving that the aggrieved party had failed in the duty to mitigate (see <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1154 (“<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span>”) at [25], recently cited in <span class="font-italic">JTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2020] 2 SLR 1256 at [250]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, in relation to the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny in assessing whether an aggrieved party’s conduct in mitigation was reasonable, it should be kept in mind that the burden on the part of the defaulting party is “ordinarily one which is not easily discharged” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [25]). The courts have sought to ensure that “the standard of reasonableness required of the aggrieved party will not be too difficult to meet” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [31]), and there is “certainly support for the view that the court should adopt a generous approach in assessing the aggrieved party’s conduct in mitigation” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [43]). This is because the duty to mitigate may “appear to be an unfair obligation to impose on the aggrieved party in relation to a breach of contract (in that the defaulting party is to blame for the breach of contract)” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>at [31]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>also agreed with the oft-cited observations in <span class="font-italic">Banco de Portugal v Waterlow and Sons, Limited </span>[1932] AC 452 (“<span class="font-italic">Banco de Portugal</span>”) at 506, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the sufferer from a breach of contract finds himself in consequence of that breach placed in a position of embarrassment[,] the measures which he may be driven to adopt in order to extricate himself ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the party whose breach of contract has occasioned the difficulty. It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but <span class="font-italic">such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held [to be] disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken</span>. [emphasis added by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span>]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>further explained that the observations in <span class="font-italic">Banco de Portugal </span>were made in response to the defaulting party’s argument that the aggrieved party should have taken some other action which would have further reduced the loss occasioned. On this point, the Court of Appeal cautioned that the court should not adopt too stringent a standard in enforcing the duty to mitigate against an aggrieved party, because “the court is not … the best-equipped arbiter of economic efficiency and the options available to the aggrieved part at the material time” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>at [44]). It is important to bear in mind that the court should determine the issue of “whether the mitigation measures taken by the aggrieved party were reasonable”, rather than the issue of “whether the aggrieved party took the best possible measures to reduce its loss” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the present case, the Defendant did not plead <span class="font-italic">any</span> particulars whatsoever in relation to his allegation that the Plaintiffs had breached their duty to mitigate losses. The Defendant merely pleaded bare allegations that the Plaintiffs were “put to strict proof” that they had adequately discharged their duty to mitigate their loss, and that the Plaintiffs “have not taken reasonable steps in their discharge of their duty of mitigation”.

They therefore do not provide compelling evidence in demonstrating the effect of market forces on the sale price of the Property following the Abortive Sale. In particular, the two articles did not actually support the Defendant’s assertion that the Property was not sold for the best possible price. This is because the 7.9% increase in property prices reported in both articles clearly referred to the overall increase in property prices <span class="font-italic">for the entirety of 2018</span>.

Indeed, the evidence before me demonstrates that the Plaintiffs had taken reasonable steps to mitigate their losses. While I am unable to agree with Plaintiffs’ counsel’s submission that the loss in sale price “clearly could not be averted no matter what steps were taken” (see [28] above), that is – in any event – not the standard that the Plaintiffs are held to. As noted at [25(c)] above, the court is called to determine “whether the mitigation measures taken by the aggrieved party were reasonable”, and not “whether the aggrieved party took the <span class="font-italic">best possible measures to reduce its loss</span>” (emphasis added).

Mr Bauer accepted that the calculation was erroneous, and explained that the $4,208.15 figure was derived from a calculation between the period from 22 May 2018 (being the day after the original completion date) to 11 January 2019, instead of the pleaded Holding Period.

</div>
</div> Despite the absence of documentary evidence, I find it reasonable to award a sum representing the pro-rated mortgage insurance for the Holding Period given the oral evidence from Mr Bauer that the Plaintiffs had paid the mortgage insurance. There was no reason for me to disbelieve Mr Bauer’s testimony in this regard, and in any event, the amount in question did not appear unreasonable. However, I am unable to rule out that a calculation error (akin to that in relation to the pro-rated property tax (see [38] above) and opportunity costs (see [41] below)) may have affected the claimed figure of $552.62. As such, I award to the Plaintiffs $481.77 (being a pro-ration of $552.62) for the head of claim relating to mortgage insurance during the Holding Period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Plaintiffs claimed costs of water and electricity used in the Property of $1,536.80, as evidenced in utilities bills from June 2018 to December 2018. At the AD Trial, I queried Mr Bauer on the relatively high utilities bill despite the fact that the Property was not occupied for six months. Mr Bauer explained that the major use of electricity was for the swimming pool filter, which had to be run “between 8 to 10 hours a day, which is lower than the recommendation, but sufficient to maintain the appearance of the pool”.

</div> While he recognised the inaccuracy of the 1.88% figure, he explained that he had done his best to obtain a reasonable figure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In response to my query on whether the Plaintiffs had indeed invested the sale proceeds following the Successful Sale, Mr Bauer testified that they had indeed invested money into Australia property and other investments. He further explained that the interest rate on his Australia property was “about 4% plus at the relevant time”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I am satisfied on the evidence before me that the Plaintiffs would have obtained some form of financial benefit had the Abortive Sale been completed on 21 June 2018. In relation to the interest rate to be applied in quantifying the opportunity cost, I decline to apply the rate of 1.88% per annum, for three reasons: (a) there is no evidence before me that the Plaintiffs would have been able to obtain a fixed deposit rate that is closer to the “priority banking preferential rate” (of 1.9% per annum) than the standard promotional rate (1.8% per annum); (b) the 1.8% per annum rate was a <span class="font-italic">promotional</span> rate that, in any event, was not available during the Holding Period; and (c) the Holding Period would not have met the tenor requirement for the promotional rate (even if the promotional rate was available and applicable). I therefore apply a discount on the interest rate for calculating opportunity cost. All matters considered, I award opportunity cost at the rate of 1.5% per annum on $2,625,148 for the Holding Period, which works out to $22,008.09. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the foregoing reasons, I award damages to the Plaintiffs assessed at a net total of $242,112.58 (after taking into consideration the deposit of $260,000).
