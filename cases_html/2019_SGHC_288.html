In its view, the “proper context” was that AIL entered into the Agreement because PEM was unable to repay the outstanding loans owed to AIL.

</div> The Agreement was meant to embody a “turnaround plan” in which AIL would take an equity stake in APTSA and, in the process, receive dividends which it would use to repay the outstanding sums owed to it. In exchange, AIL would agree to the novation of the 2013 and 2014 loans. This would discharge PEM of its outstanding liabilities and extinguish Mr Kam’s liabilities under the personal guarantees. Given the “proper context”, AIL submitted that both parties could not have intended for the liabilities of PEM and Mr Kam to be extinguished on the date of Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Text before context </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 My analysis begins with the language of the Agreement. There are several reasons why the text of the Agreement does not support Mr Kam’s interpretation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, Clause 5(d) of the Agreement reads “AIL <span class="font-italic">shall </span>novate its existing USD 1,000,000 loan with interest to ARI. ARI shall be responsible for this loan and interest, meaning that repayment shall be when dividends distributed (to AIL) upon a successful turnaround, shall be applied to settling the loan”. One of the definitions of the word “shall” provided by the <span class="font-italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> is a modal verb which is used to express the <span class="font-italic">future</span> tense. The example provided in relation to this is “this time next week I <span class="font-italic">shall </span>be in Scotland”. <span class="font-italic">Black’s Law </span><span class="font-italic">Dictionary </span>likewise defines “shall” as a future-tense verb, as in “the debtor shall then be released from all debts”. In this case, the word “shall”, in the context in which it appears, implies that novation would take place in the future. If parties had intended for novation to take place immediately, phrases such as “AIL novates the loan...” or “by this Agreement, AIL novates the loan” would have been used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, Clause 5(d) itself, on closer reading, provides that novation takes place only after dividends have been distributed to AIL upon a successful turnaround (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a future event). Thus, although the first line of the clause is silent on <span class="font-italic">when</span> novation should take place, the second sentence of Clause 5(d) goes on to state that “ARI shall be responsible for this loan and interest, <span class="font-italic">meaning that repayment shall be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">when</span> dividends distributed (to AIL) upon a successful turnaround, shall be applied to settling the loan” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 At this juncture, it is worth highlighting briefly the nature of novation as it assists in the task of interpreting Clause 5(d). A contractual liability, such as an obligation to repay an outstanding loan, cannot be transferred unilaterally and requires a novation: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore –</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 80.431. When a contract is novated, the old agreement is extinguished and a new contract is formed with new or substituted parties (or in some cases, between the same parties): <span class="font-italic">Fairview Developments Pte Ltd v Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 318 at [46]. Having regard to the nature of novation, the phrase “ARI shall be responsible for this loan and interest” is an obvious reference to the legal effect of novation. Spelled out, this legal effect is that the “substituted party” to the contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ARI, will assume PEM’s liabilities under the 2013 and 2014 loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Having stated that ARI “shall be responsible for [the] loan and interest” (this referring to the legal effect of novation), the second sentence of the clause goes on to explain <span class="font-italic">when </span>this effect, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the novation, kicks in: “<span class="font-italic">…meaning that </span>repayment shall be <span class="font-italic">when </span>dividends distributed (to AIL) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">upon a successful turnaround</span>” [emphasis added]. The use of the clarificatory phrase “meaning that” preceding the phrase “repayment shall be <span class="font-italic">when</span>” suggests that parties intended for the latter part of this clause to explain <span class="font-italic">when</span> novation was to take place. Thus, the second sentence of Clause 5(d) clarifies that novation takes place at the time when dividends are distributed to AIL upon a successful turnaround of PT ARI.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third, the interpretation that novation takes place upon the successful turnaround of PT ARI is supported by Clause 4(c) of the Agreement. The clause states that “ARI reserves the right to terminate the turnaround plan should it not work out”. Accepting Mr Kam’s interpretation that novation takes place “immediately” would render ARI’s right of termination nugatory. This is because ARI would immediately be burdened with the liabilities under the two loans. This having happened, it would become pointless for ARI to exercise its right of termination were it “not [to] work out” as it would be saddled with liability <span class="font-italic">regardless</span> of what transpired after the Agreement. This does not appear to be what the parties’ objectively intended. Instead, ARI’s right of termination is consistent with the interpretation that novation (to ARI) is contingent on the successful turnaround of PT ARI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Fourth, Clause 5(d) must be considered in the light of Clause 5(e). Like Clause 5(d), Clause 5(e) speaks of novation. The material part of Clause 5(e) states “AIL agrees to novate the loan and interest from PEM to ARI, <span class="font-italic">and </span>hereby agrees that PEM be shut down <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> without further liabilities…<span class="font-italic">after </span>all liabilities of PEM have been discharged”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Mr Kam relied on the use of the word “immediately” in  Clause 5(e) to argue that novation takes place “immediately” in September 2015. On closer scrutiny, it is clear that the word “immediately” cannot be interpreted to mean “instantaneously”. This is because the phrase stipulating that PEM is to be shut down “immediately” goes on to say that it is only to be shut down “<span class="font-italic">after </span>all liabilities” have been discharged. The language of Clause 5(e) therefore, plainly understood, does not support Mr Kam’s interpretation that novation takes place “immediately” in September 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In any case, I am of the view that the word “immediately” attaches to the second phrase and not the first. A natural reading of the entire Clause 5(e) indicates that the word “immediately” refers to when PEM is to be shut down and not when “AIL agrees to novate”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Finally, the entire Clause 5 (consisting of its various sub-clauses) supports AIL’s case that novation takes place only after certain conditions are satisfied. At the outset, I note that the title of Clause 5 states “Debt Restructure”. This is the subject-matter of the entire clause. Clause 5(a) reads “Post this exercise, the ‘Existing Shareholder Group’ (excluding ARI) shall be responsible for the loans outstanding to creditors”. In light of the title of Clause 5, the use of the word “exercise” must be a reference to the “debt restructuring exercise”. Following from this, Clause 5(b) goes on to state the manner in which the debt is to be restructured: “Loans are to be re-negotiated (achieve substantial haircuts) and restructured such that any dividends distributed (to the Existing Shareholder Group) upon a successful turnaround, shall be applied to settling the loans.” This clause in particular, together with Clauses 5(d) and 5(e), evidences the parties’ objective intention that PEM’s liability under the loan agreements was never meant to cease immediately in September 2015. Instead, the parties’ intention, gleaned objectively from a holistic consideration of Clause 5, was for PEM’s liability to be extinguished (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for novation to take place) only when dividends from APTSA were distributed to ARI upon a successful turnaround of PT ARI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Similarly, there are several reasons why Mr Kam’s interpretation of Clause 5(e) cannot stand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Like Clause 5(d), Clause 5(e) stipulates that “the personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] <span class="font-italic">shall</span> also be dissolved with immediate effect”. The use of the word “shall”, in the context in which it appears, indicates that the dissolution of Mr Kam’s personal guarantees is to take place in the future.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The manner in which the entire Clause 5(e) is worded also makes apparent that several events must <span class="font-italic">first</span> take place <span class="font-italic">before</span> the personal guarantees are discharged. These are as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, dividends must be paid out to ARI (upon a successful turnaround of PT ARI). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, AIL novates the loan and interest from PEM to ARI. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, PEM is to be shut down immediately after all its liabilities have been discharged. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, Mr Kam’s personal guarantees are to be discharged at the <span class="font-italic">same time</span> that PEM is shut down. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Clause 5(e) states “<span class="font-italic">as per Clause 5(d), </span>AIL agrees to novate the loan and interest from PEM…”. However, given that Clause 5(e) is to be read subject to Clause 5(d), which properly construed, provides that novation takes place only <span class="font-italic">after</span> dividends are paid out to ARI by APTSA (upon a successful turnaround of PT ARI), the very <span class="font-italic">first </span>event which must take place is the dividend payment by APTSA to ARI. It is the payment of dividends that triggers novation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Thereafter, AIL novates the loans from PEM to ARI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Next, PEM is to be shut down. It is clear that this step must follow after the <span class="font-italic">novation</span>, as shut-down is to take place only “after all [its] liabilities…have been discharged”. PEM’s liabilities cannot conceivably be discharged until after novation has taken place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 After Clause 5(e) states “…that PEM be shut-down immediately without further liabilities in accordance with the laws of Singapore after all liabilities of PEM have been discharged”, it says that “the personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall <span class="font-italic">also</span> be dissolved with immediate effect”. The use of the word “also” indicates that the dissolution of Mr Kam’s guarantees is to take place at the same time as PEM’s shut-down. Interpreting “the personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall <span class="font-italic">also</span> be dissolved with immediate effect” in the context of the Clause 5(e), as well as the chronology of events which it entails, strongly implies that the words “with immediate effect” should not be interpreted to mean “instantaneously”. Thus, the discharge of liabilities was not intended to take place immediately in September 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Finally, just as the word “immediately” was not intended by the parties to be interpreted to mean “instantaneously” (see above at [37]), the same can be said about the words “with immediate effect”. That both “immediately” and “with immediate effect” are to be given the same meaning is bolstered upon reading Clause 5(e) in its entirety. Reading the phrases “…that PEM be shut-down immediately without further liabilities in accordance with the laws of Singapore after all liabilities of PEM have been discharged…” and “the personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">also</span> be dissolved with immediate effect” [emphasis added] together, it becomes apparent that the words “immediately” and “with immediate effect” are to be given the same interpretation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In summary, based on a textual analysis of the Agreement: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) novation is to take place after dividends have been paid out to ARI, upon the successful turnaround of PT ARI; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the personal guarantees are to be discharged at the same time as when PEM is shut down (after all its liabilities have been discharged). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Context </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 AIL urged the court to bear in mind the “proper context” of the Agreement.

</div> Both of them agreed on a “turnaround plan”, although it is disputed which party proposed it. This was the plan eventually embodied in the Agreement. ARI was to inject capital into PT ARI through APTSA by way of a convertible loan. In exchange, ARI was to be given fixed shareholdings in APTSA.

</div> The emails show that Mr Kam was seeking to assuage AIL’s fears concerning the outstanding loans and soliciting its help (through Mr Chang) to improve PT ARI’s financial state.

</div> and solicited AIL’s investment.  This led to a meeting between the parties on 24 July 2015 (which forms the subject of Mr Kam’s defence of an oral agreement that I shall address later). Emails were then exchanged between AIL and Mr Kam’s representatives, which eventually concluded in the signing of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The above background leads me to the following conclusions. It is evident that throughout the negotiating process and the signing of the Agreement, both parties were always acting in their self-interest. The “turnaround plan” embodied in the Agreement was intended as a “win-win” solution for the various parties involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 One of AIL’s key motives was to secure repayment of the outstanding loans. It was always intended that these loans would be repaid, albeit through a circuitous mechanism. Dividends would be paid out to ARI from APTSA (upon a successful turnaround of PT ARI) and these dividends would be used to satisfy the outstanding debt. Another possible motive was a potential return on its investment in PT ARI through acquired shares in APTSA.  Turning to Mr Kam, if the turnaround plan was successful, PT ARI (through the borrowing entity, PEM) would no longer be liable to repay the outstanding loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Having understood the parties’ respective motives, it flies in the face of commercial common sense for AIL to enter into the Agreement only to “immediately” give up the only form of security it had, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Kam’s personal guarantees, as well as novate the loans to ARI, in exchange for nothing in return. Accepting Mr Kam’s proposed interpretation (on both the novation and guarantee issues) would mean that AIL was practically “forgiving” the debt of an arms-length commercial counterparty. No reason was provided by Mr Kam on why this might have been done in the circumstances. Further, applying Mr Kam’s interpretation would mean that there would no longer be any incentive for Mr Kam to ensure the successful turnaround of PT ARI. With PEM and his own liability discharged, there would be nothing left to do. This is a commercially insensible result which, from the evidence available to me, does not appear to be what the parties objectively intended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 This is also not a situation where “the parties were aware of the absurd result that might ensue from the contractual terms, but nevertheless proceeded to enter into the contract in question”: <span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant </span>at [32]. Both parties are sophisticated men of business, and have conducted themselves on an arms-length basis. Mr Kam described himself as an investor or entrepreneur, running companies that focus on real estate in Japan, Australia and Thailand.

</div> Meanwhile, Mr Chang also appeared to me to be an investor capable of protecting his commercial interests. There is no objective evidence which might reveal that the parties were aware that a commercially illogical result was likely to result from the contractual terms (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, both novation and the discharge of Mr Kam’s guarantees taking place immediately) but still proceeded to enter into the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Relevance of the email correspondence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Mr Kam relied on several correspondence to support his interpretation of the Agreement. I will deal with each of them in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The first email was sent by Ms Tan to Mr Tin on 27 July 2015. It contains a draft copy of the Agreement, which has a clause stating that “Since [AIL] is responsible for its own loan, the 100% shares [which were held in Mr Kam’s name on behalf of APTSA] shall be transferred to AIL or its representative to hold in name on behalf of APTSA”. Mr Kam did not explain how this clause in the draft Agreement supports his proposed interpretation of the Agreement. I am also cognisant that this clause was eventually removed from the final version of the Agreement and cannot, therefore, be treated as reflecting the objective intention of the parties under the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The second email was sent by Mr Tin on 25 August 2015. It contained a draft version of the Agreement. There is an additional phrase “…agreed to novate the loan agreements from PEM to APTSA” in the draft. This phrase does not assist Mr Kam as APTSA is not even the party to which the loans are to be novated to under the final Agreement. In any case, the phrase entirely omits any mention on when novation is to take place and therefore does not shed light on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The final email was sent by Ms Tan to Carol Pang (an employee of AIL) on 29 October 2015. The email contains two typographical amendments to the draft Agreement. After the amendments, the relevant clause is the same as the equivalent clause in final version of the Agreement, which is that “repayment [of the loan] shall be when dividends [are distributed to AIL]”.

In the circumstances, the email does not throw further light on the parties’ intention under the Agreement.  Furthermore, as the email is evidence of post-contractual conduct, it must be viewed with utmost scrutiny and concern (see <span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corinna </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1083 at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Like the first email, the second email does not assist Mr Kam’s case.

This was intended as a response to an earlier email to Ms Tan on 29 October 2015 stating “Hi [Ms Tan], [could] you help us <span class="font-italic">draft a simple novation agreement</span>?” [emphasis added].

Further, there was no follow-up by Mr Kam or any of his representatives after 18 November 2015 confirming that the personal guarantees had been discharged. This was yet another indication that Mr Kam never genuinely believed that the personal guarantees had dissolved, whether on 24 July 2015 or subsequently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It must also be borne in mind that the alleged oral agreement was said to have been formed on 24 July 2015. In this regard, the correspondence immediately following the meeting on 24 July 2015 would be particularly illuminating on the existence of the oral agreement.  The emails that were sent out after 24 July 2015 referred to many matters which related to the “joint venture” between the parties. For instance, the email sent out by Mr Tin to Ms Tan on 2 September 2015 referred to PEM’s outstanding loan, the contracting parties to the Agreement, as well as queries on when APTSA would inject the funds into PT ARI.

I noted above that the objective of the Agreement was for parties to rescue PT ARI from its financial problems (see at [53]), so that it could repay its outstanding loans (which were owed through PEM as the borrowing entity). I also held that it would have been commercially insensible for AIL to give up its only form of security, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the personal guarantees, in exchange for nothing. Similarly, it would have been illogical for AIL to give up its only form of security simply for Mr Kam to procure APTSA to enter the “joint venture”. In this regard, I agree with Mr Chang’s evidence that it would be illogical for him to release his leverage over Mr Kam in respect of PT ARI’s turnaround.

This is not an instance where it is possible to apply a presumption of reliance as a “commonsense inference” (<span class="font-italic">Lim Koon Park </span>at [54]). On the contrary, the evidence shows that AIL had compelling commercial reasons for entering into the Agreement, in particular to secure repayment of the substantial sums owed to it, and would have entered into the Agreement even if it had known about the CAL loan.

However, the closing of this agreement shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise result in a merger to deprive ARI of the right to sue the Company for breach of warranty in respect of any matter warranted, whether or not ascertained by ARI prior to closing:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) [APTSA] has made full and fair disclosure in all material respects of any matter that could reasonably be expected to affect ARI’s decision to purchase the Shares on the terms set out in this agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.

Clause 1.3(f) clearly states that the obligation is for <span class="font-italic">APTSA</span> to make “full and fair disclosure”, not Mr Kam. AIL did not suggest that this clause could be interpreted to include Mr Kam owing a duty of “full and frank disclosure”. As Mr Kam owes no duty of full and frank disclosure pursuant to Clause 1.3(f), he could not possibly have committed a breach of warranty under the said provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Equally unsustainable is AIL’s claim for breach pursuant to Clause 11 of the Agreement. The clause provides that Mr Kam shall warrant that the Group’s (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>PEM, PT ARI and APTSA) financial statements are fairly disclosed to <span class="font-italic">ARI</span>. In its submissions, AIL failed to cite evidence that the Group’s financial statements were not<span class="font-italic"> </span>disclosed to <span class="font-italic">ARI</span>. Also, AIL did not cross-examine Mr Kam on his alleged failure to fairly disclose the Group’s financial statements to <span class="font-italic">ARI</span>. Given that there is no evidence of a failure to disclose matters to <span class="font-italic">AR</span><span class="font-italic">I</span>, I find that Mr Kam did not breach Clause 11. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103  The preamble to the Appendix provides that Mr Kam shall warrant the accuracy of the “…detailed info provided in Appendix ‘Loan Status’” and “…detailed info provided in Appendix ‘Financial statements’”. Unfortunately for AIL, it failed to raise anything in the evidence which was false vis-à-vis the “detailed info” provided in the parts titled “Loan Status” or “Financial Statements” under the Appendix. AIL’s main argument in support of its claim for breach of warranty was premised on Mr Kam’s failure to disclose certain loan agreements involving PEM. Ultimately, this had to be tied explicitly to some information which was contained in the parts titled “Loan Status” and “Financial Statements” in the Appendix. AIL failed to do this. In the premises, there is no evidence that Mr Kam breached the term in the Appendix. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Promissory Estoppel  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Kam relied on three representations made by AIL in support of his estoppel argument: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Clause 4 of the Agreement accompanied by ARI’s subsequent action of disbursing US$320,000 to PEM.

Clause 4 simply describes part of the turnaround plan which was intended by both parties to rescue PT ARI from financial trouble. The significant part of the turnaround plan described here is the injection of US$750,000 into APTSA in the form of a “convertible loan”. Mr Kam also pointed to the fact that there was a subsequent disbursement of US$320,000 from ARI to PEM after the Agreement was signed. I take him to be saying that this was an implied representation that AIL would no longer call on the personal guarantees given by Mr Kam. Far from carrying this implication, I find that ARI’s disbursement of US$320,000 simply shows that it had sincerely intended to satisfy its obligations under the Agreement. In any case, I see no logical reason why <span class="font-italic">ARI’s </span>disbursement of money to <span class="font-italic">PEM </span>would mean that <span class="font-italic">AIL </span>was representing that it would no longer call on <span class="font-italic">Mr </span><span class="font-italic">Kam’s </span>personal guarantees. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second representation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Clause 5(e) of the Agreement contains the term, “(t)he personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall also be dissolved with immediate effect”. I have already determined that the phrase “immediate effect” cannot be interpreted to mean the personal guarantees are discharged on the date on which the Agreement was signed. Given this interpretation, Clause 5(e) is not a “clear and unequivocal” representation that Mr Kam’s guarantees will be discharged as of the date of the signing of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Mr Kam submitted that AIL’s failure to demand repayment also constituted a “clear and unequivocal representation” from AIL that his guarantees would be discharged on the date the Agreement was signed.

This is one of the requirements set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction </span>at [61].

Unfortunately for Mr Kam, he failed to present any evidence from which I could infer such knowledge.
