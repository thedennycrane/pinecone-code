</div> and b) that there was difficulty in determining the value of the wife’s assets, which included a house in Indonesia and income from the wife’s business clients in Indonesia.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The husband was represented at the divorce ancillary matters hearing.   On 11 February 2015, he obtained final judgment.  The wife acted in person both at the hearing and when filing her Notice of Appeal (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 7 April 2015).  She did not apply to stay execution of the 4 February 2015 order.  She subsequently engaged counsel to represent her on appeal and notice of this appointment was given on 24 June 2015.  The husband was, on appeal, represented by counsel from a different law firm as his previous counsel had left practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 21 August 2015, when I gave my decision, counsel informed me that the matrimonial flat had already been sold with the net sales proceeds distributed as per the 4 February 2015 order.  I was later informed that completion of the matrimonial flat had been effected on 28 May 2015 pursuant to an option for purchase granted on 17 March 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I left undisturbed the District Judge’s order for each party to retain assets in their own names.  As noted above (at [2]), I varied the order for the net sales proceeds of the matrimonial flat to be divided in the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the husband.  As the net sales proceeds had already been distributed in the ratio of 80:20 in favour of the husband, I directed him to pay an additional 25% of the net sales proceeds to the wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As was done by the District Judge, I did not ascribe a value to the wife’s house in Indonesia to be added to the matrimonial pool.  I adopted the same approach when dealing with the net sales proceeds of the previous matrimonial flat.  As detailed later, these, as well as other factors, were considered in the round such that I did not deem it necessary to make any additions to the matrimonial pool for division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The husband, by a subsequent letter of 1 September 2015 from his counsel, argued that the 21 August 2015 order was not workable as he did not have cash to pay the additional 25% of the net sales proceeds to the wife as he only had $71,712.80 left (after buying a 3-room HDB flat, spending on a holiday to Thailand, paying car accident excess, repaying $15,000 loan to his parents, etc) with anticipated further expenses of $25,000 on renovation and furnishings for his new flat.  I found no merit in this submission.  The husband knew of the wife’s appeal filed on 7 April 2015 before completion of the sale of the matrimonial flat on 28 May 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I proceed now to detail the methodology which I utilised in arriving at my computation.  In the light of the recent authority of <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>, I will explain my methodology with reference to the framework that was expounded in that decision.  In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>, the Court of Appeal<span class="font-italic"> </span>elaborated upon a three-step process which should be utilised.  First, the court should ascribe a ratio representing each party’s respective direct contributions towards the acquisition and/or improvement of the matrimonial assets.  Secondly, the court will ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s respective indirect contribution to the well-being of the family.  An average will then be reached based on both these ratios.  Thirdly, if there are compelling reasons to do so, further adjustments may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions (see <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [22] and [36]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 1: Ascertaining the direct contributions of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I first computed the value of all the assets which formed part of the matrimonial pool.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Value of the  matrimonial flat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The parties’ only joint asset was the matrimonial flat.  I adopted the District Judge’s findings that: a) the net equity of the matrimonial flat was $505,591.65; b) the husband’s direct financial contribution towards the matrimonial flat (through use of his CPF funds) was $224,055; c) the wife’s contribution (through use of her CPF funds) was $7,000; and d) the husband’s alleged $39,000 cash contribution was not to be counted as this could have come from the sales proceeds of the parties’ previous matrimonial flat in Depot Road.  The ratio of parties’ direct financial contribution to the matrimonial flat was therefore 97:3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assets in the parties’ sole names</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The assets in each of their sole names were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">The husband’s assets</span> were valued at $221,941.  This figure included the amount of $148,362.25 in the husband’s CPF account.  Although the District Judge had used a different figure of $18,234.48 for his CPF funds, I was of the view that this figure was not correct.

This is not to say that I did not take into account the value of the other assets in arriving at my eventual decision.

The $150,000 was increased to $200,000 on 17 September 2008, when the husband deposited another $50,000 which was attributed to initial profits.

</div>  I found that the wife is the beneficial owner of a property in Jakarta, where her family stays.  Her account was that she initially wanted to buy a house from a personal friend, pegged at a friendly price of $100,000, towards which she had paid $9,000.  There was no proper paper work.  She did minor renovations (about $20,000) before the daughter was born in 2006.  As her $9,000 payment was less than the rental income that her friend could have made in the last 8 years, her share of the house would have been very small.  As she was now struggling with money, she intended to return the house to her friend, once she returned to Jakarta and after finding rental accommodation.

The wife’s greater flexibility in working from home on her business (set up in 2002), albeit that she would also go to Indonesia, would mean greater contribution on her part in the non-financial areas on the home front and in the care and development of their daughter, more so after October 2011, when parties lived separately.  I noted the finding of the District Judge on each party’s indirect contribution in paragraphs 14 to 16 of her Grounds of Decision.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I attributed a ratio of 25:75 as between the husband and wife respectively for their indirect contributions to the matrimonial flat.  I reached the above ratio on the basis of several facts.  The wife was the main caregiver for their daughter and carried out her business from home albeit with some overseas travel to Indonesia.  Whatever the reason for the wife’s departure from the matrimonial home in October 2011, there was no denying that she continued then with the care of their daughter, for whom she has care and control.  This was consistent with the District Judge’s finding that the bulk of the direct and indirect financial contribution to the marriage came from the husband.  The District Judge found the wife to be a dedicated mother, who took good care of the daughter and was clearly the main caregiver.  For the daughter’s sake, the wife had attended Montessori classes and had even tried to learn Chinese to coach her daughter; she taught the daughter to read and write; she accompanied the daughter for her classes; and she designed and built the daughter’s giant play pen with the list going on.  After she left the matrimonial home in October 2011, she became the daughter’s main emotional support.  The District Judge also found that in other aspects, the wife had contributed towards the aesthetics and comforts of the home, turning the home into a place more comfortable than a “5-star hotel.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On the basis of equal weight being attached to the direct and indirect contributions to the matrimonial flat (the direction contribution to the matrimonial flat being in the ratio of 97:3 as noted above at [17]), this yielded an overall ratio of 61:39 with respect to the matrimonial flat.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 3: Adjustment to percentage contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As alluded to earlier, at this stage of the analysis, I took into account the fact that the parties were to hold their respective assets in their own names and that the husband had a far greater amount of assets being held in his name as compared to the wife. I also took into consideration the relative strength of the adverse inferences to be drawn against both the husband and wife for their respective under-declaration of assets. I also considered that the husband had enjoyed a period of rent-free occupation of the matrimonial flat since October 2011 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the wife’s departure) and that he had received rental income of $16,000 for the matrimonial flat during the period of February to November 2013.

For the sake of clarity, I would add that if I had considered the rest of the assets with the matrimonial flat at the first two steps of the analysis instead of at the final step, I would have arrived at the same ratio for the division of the matrimonial flat (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 55:45 in favour of the husband).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 If I had considered the matrimonial pool as a whole, I would have attributed an indirect contribution ratio of 60:40 in favour of the wife.  Based on the direct contribution ratio of 98:2, in favour of the husband, to the entirety of the matrimonial pool (see above at [20]), this would have yielded an overall split of 69:31 for the matrimonial pool.  That would mean that the wife would have been entitled to $226,361 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 31% of the total assets valued at $730,198).  Since I was minded to allow parties to retain the assets in their respective names, I would have deducted the sum of $2,666 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the value of the wife’s declared assets) to reach a figure of $223,695.  This figure would amount to 44% of the matrimonial flat which was valued at $505,591.  In those circumstances, I would have had no qualms rounding up the wife’s share in the matrimonial flat to 45% as I was of the view that this percentage reflected a just and equitable division of the matrimonial flat. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Based on the above reasoning, I made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the division of the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial flat should be varied from 80:20 to 55:45; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the District Judge’s order for each party to retain assets in their own name should be upheld.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I gave no order as to costs since, as noted above at [2], I had only allowed the appeal against the District Judge’s decision in part. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Foo Tuat Yien</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">D Rani (instructed) and Alagappan S/O Arunasalam</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">(A Alagappan Law Corporation) for the appellant/wife;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">Aye Cheng Shone (M/s A C Shone &amp; Co) for the respondent/</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">husband </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
