        Seow Zhixiang AR:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application for specific
                    discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The applicant is the main contractor and
                    occupier of a worksite at Balmoral Crescent. In the main action, the applicant
                    and two other companies are being sued by the estate of a worker who was crushed
                    to death by a metal frame which fell while it was being lifted by a crane. The
                    proximate cause of the accident was the snapping of a steel wire rope carrying
                    the metal frame. The rope was seized by the Workplace Health and Safety
                    Inspectorate of the Ministry of Manpower, who commissioned MATCOR Technology
                    &amp; Services Pte Ltd (“MATCOR”) to prepare a report (“the
                    MATCOR report”) relating to tests conducted on the rope.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The applicant seeks specific discovery of the
                    MATCOR report. The other parties in the main action have written to the
                    applicant to express their support for its position but are not formally
                    interested in this application. The Ministry of Manpower resists the application
                    on the basis of (i) the official communications privilege found in s 126(1)
                    of the Evidence Act (Chapter 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and (ii) litigation
                    privilege. There was no dispute, and I accept, that the MATCOR report is
                    essential to the first defendant’s case (and indeed the main action). But
                    that is no answer to a valid assertion of privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Official communications privilege</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Section 126(1) of the Evidence Act provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Official communications</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>126</b>. —(1) No public officer shall be
                        compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence when
                        he considers that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Court of Appeal has held in <em>Zainal bin Kuning v Chan Sin Mian</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 858 at [32] that, when the s 126(1) official
                    communications privilege is asserted, “it is for the court to decide
                    whether the communication in question was made to the public officer in official
                    confidence and it is for the officer concerned to decide whether public
                    interests would suffer by the disclosure of the communication”. On the
                    facts, the Court of Appeal accepted that the relevant documents were
                    communicated in official confidence and held that the <em>bona
                        fide</em> determination of the relevant officers that the public
                    interest would suffer by their disclosure was sufficient to establish the
                    privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the present case, Mr Goh Chin Keong, a
                    senior assistant director of investigations in the Workplace Health and Safety
                    Inspectorate, deposed in support of the Ministry’s assertion of the
                    official communications privilege in relation to the MATCOR report, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The MATCOR report was commissioned by the Occupational Safety &amp; Health
                        Inspectorate, MOM, so that its Investigating Officers can benefit from the
                        expert advice concerning the cause of the accident and decide where the
                        criminal liability for the accident lay. The MATCOR report forms part of the
                        Investigation Papers, and the MATCOR report was furnished to MOM in official
                        confidence. The MATCOR report is not intended to facilitate the gathering
                        and collation of evidence for the benefit of private litigants in the
                        pursuit of their private interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a broad public interest in facilitating investigations and having
                        the swift apprehension and punishment of offenders for worksite accidents,
                        in order to maintain public safety. Furthering this public interest requires
                        MATCOR to be forthcoming and candid in its report to the Occupational Safety
                        &amp; Health Inspectorate, MOM. The MATCOR report includes the opinions and
                        comments of the expert which are confidential in nature and made to assist
                        public officers in determining the causal and liability issues for the
                        worksite accident for the purposes of criminal investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant [<em>ie</em> the applicant] was the occupier of the premises when the
                        accident happened, making it a potential accused person. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        Defendants, who are the suppliers of the crane and steel wire rope
                        respectively, are also potential accused persons. Disclosure of the MATCOR
                        report is against the public interest as it breaches the confidentiality of
                        the MATCOR report which forms part of the Investigation Papers. For the
                        above reasons, I strongly believe that the public interest would suffer if
                        the MATCOR report commissioned by and furnished to the Occupational Safety
                        &amp; Health Inspectorate, MOM, were to be disclosed in the present
                        matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Counsel for the applicant did not dispute that
                    the MATCOR report was made in official confidence. Instead, he argued that
                    public interest against disclosure, as stated by Mr Goh, was outweighed by
                    the public interest in the administration of justice, which militates in favour
                    of disclosure. In support of his argument, counsel referred to the decision of
                    the district court in <em>Re E (guardianship of an
                        infant)</em> [2003] SGDC 84.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Now, I accept that, under s 126(1), the
                    relevant public officer does not have an unfettered discretion to determine that
                    the public interest would suffer by the disclosure of the relevant
                    communications. As the Court of Appeal held in <em>Chng Suan Tze
                        v Minister for Home Affairs</em> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 at
                    [86], “the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to
                    the rule of law. All power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the
                    courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power.”
                    Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <em>Zainal bin Kuning v Chan
                        Sin Mian</em> (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>) was careful to state that the
                    determinations of public interest in that case were made <em>bona
                        fide</em>. More generally, I would say that the court can review the
                    legality of a determination of public interest under s 126(1) on the usual
                    grounds known to administrative law. Certiorari will not issue if the
                    proceedings were not made under Order 53 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), but the court can nevertheless
                    disregard an illegal assertion of public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       But the argument made by counsel for the
                    applicant does not go towards the legality of Mr Goh’s determination.
                    It goes towards the merits of Mr Goh’s determination, which are
                    within Mr Goh’s discretion. Therefore, unless Mr Goh’s
                    determination was irrational in the <em>Wednesbury</em>
                    sense, and this is hardly the case, I cannot review the same, but must instead
                    accept it for the purposes of s 126(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I do not think that <em>Re
                        E</em> (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>) assists the applicant. In that case, the
                    learned district judge applied the common law balancing test in deciding whether
                    or not to compel Singapore Immigration and Registration to give discovery and
                    answer interrogatories, and concluded that the public interest in maintaining
                    the confidentiality of information pertaining to national defence and internal
                    security outweighed the public interest of the administration of justice in the
                    disclosure of evidence. Unlike in this case, the s 126(1) privilege was not
                    asserted. This is critical, because the s 126(1) privilege does not, as
                    shown above, depend on a balancing test by the court, but on the determination
                    of the relevant public officer. So <em>Re E</em> is wholly
                    distinguishable. Also, I should add, with great respect, that the balancing test
                    applied in <em>Re E</em> appears to be inconsistent with
                    the s 126(1) privilege and may, to the extent of the inconsistency, have
                    been repealed by virtue of s 2(2) of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I initially had some doubts as to whether
                    Mr Goh was the correct officer to make the determination that the public
                    interest would suffer by the disclosure of the MATCOR report. Under
                    s 126(1), the officer who makes the determination must be the officer to
                    whom the relevant communication was made. There was nothing in his affidavit to
                    show that the MATCOR report was made to Mr Goh. However, counsel for the
                    Attorney-General pointed out that the MATCOR report was commissioned by the
                    Workplace Health and Safety Inspectorate and made to it, and argued therefore
                    that Mr Goh, as a senior assistant director of the Inspectorate, was a
                    proper officer under s 126(1). I accept this argument. A communication can
                    be made to a group of officers or a single officer. In the case of the former,
                    any officer in the group with the necessary authority can make the relevant
                    determination under s 126(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I therefore hold that the s 126(1)
                    official communications privilege was validly asserted over the MATCOR
                    report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Litigation privilege</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Litigation privilege was examined by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ),
                        Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2007] 2 SLR(R) 367. The Court of Appeal held (at [67]) that
                    litigation privilege at common law was envisaged by s 131 of the Evidence
                    Act, and not inconsistent with ss 128 and 131 of the same Act read together. It
                    also set out the two elements of litigation privilege. First, there must be a
                    reasonable prospect of litigation. Secondly, the legal advice must be taken for
                    the dominant purpose of anticipated or contemplated litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     If I may say so respectfully, the Court of
                    Appeal was right to specify in that litigation privilege in our law is based on
                    ss 128 and 131 of the Evidence Act, for otherwise the privilege would be
                    inconsistent with the Evidence Act, under which evidence is admissible if
                    relevant, unless specifically excepted: <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 239.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the facts, Mr Goh deposed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I verily believe that the MATCOR report is privileged from disclosure as
                        it is protected by litigation privilege. As the
                            1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants are potential accused persons,
                        the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Inspectorate commissioned MATCOR
                        Technology &amp; Services Pte Ltd to prepare the MATCOR report in reasonable
                        contemplation of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I have considerable difficulty in seeing how
                    ss 128 and 131, which form the basis of litigation privilege in our law,
                    would apply to the MATCOR report. Now, ss 128 and 131 provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Professional communications</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>128</b>. —(1) No advocate or solicitor
                        shall at any time be permitted, unless with his client’s express
                        consent, to disclose any communication made to him in the course and for the
                        purpose of his employment as such advocate or solicitor by or on behalf of
                        his client, or to state the contents or condition of any document with which
                        he has become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of his
                        professional employment, or to disclose any advice given by him to his
                        client in the course and for the purpose of such employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Confidential communications with legal
                            advisers</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>131</b>. No one shall be compelled to disclose
                        to the court any confidential communication which has taken place between
                        him and his legal professional adviser unless he offers himself as a
                        witness, in which case he may be compelled to disclose any such
                        communications as may appear to the court necessary to be known in order to
                        explain any evidence which he has given, but no others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">MATCOR is certainly not an advocate or a solicitor for the purposes of
                    s 128, or, unless the term is stretched beyond recognition, a legal
                    professional adviser for the purposes of s 131. Can the two sections be
                    extended beyond their language? I rather doubt so, given the scheme of the
                    Evidence Act, where evidence is admissible if relevant, unless specifically
                    excepted. At any rate, a full analysis would be rather involved and quite
                    unnecessary on the facts, given my finding that the s 126(1) privilege
                    applies to the MATCOR report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I also have considerable difficulty with the
                    proposition, advanced by counsel for the Attorney-General, that litigation
                    privilege, as it is understood in civil proceedings, applies in exactly the same
                    way to criminal proceedings, for which the MATCOR report was commissioned. If
                    this is right then all material made in the course of criminal investigation
                    would be caught by the privilege. This is a very broad proposition, and not
                    supported by precedent or practice. Now, it can be argued that litigation
                    privilege in civil law applies to the discovery of investigative material in
                    civil proceedings but not the disclosure of the same investigative material in
                    criminal proceedings, which would be governed by the rules of criminal
                    procedure. But this would raise larger issues about the nature and scope of
                    litigation privilege and, once again, a full analysis would be rather involved
                    and quite unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I therefore express no concluded opinion on
                    litigation privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I therefore dismiss the application on the
                    ground that Mr Goh had validly asserted the official communications
                    privilege in s 126(1) of the Evidence Act in respect of the MATCOR
                    report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel agreed that the Attorney-General was
                    entitled to costs regardless of the outcome. I so order, and fix costs at
                    $1,200, including disbursements.</p>
