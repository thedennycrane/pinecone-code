<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">1.        The first

appellant, Thongthot Yordsa-Art (‘Thongthot’), and the second appellant,

Dornchinnamat Yingyos (‘Dornchinnamat’), who are both Thai nationals, were

jointly tried and convicted of the following charge:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">You, Thongthot Yordsa-Art and Dornchinnamat Yingyos, are

    charged that you, on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of June 2001, between 10.00 p.m. and

    12.00 midnight, at a vacant lot of land off Pioneer Road North, Singapore, together with 4

    other unknown males were members of an unlawful assembly whose joint common object was to

    cause grievous hurt to one Saenphan Thawan (male/23 years), and while you were a member of

    the said assembly, you and/or one or more of the members committed murder by causing the

    death of the said Saenphan Thawan, an offence which you knew to be likely to be committed

    in the prosecution of the common object of the assembly and you have by virtue of section

    149 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) committed an offence punishable under section 302 of

    the Penal Code.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2.        The trial

judge imposed the death sentence on both the appellants.</font></p>
<p align="center" xmlns=""><font size="3"> <b>A. BACKGROUND</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3.        The

deceased, Saenphan Thawan (‘Yaou’), apparently wielded a measure of influence in

an area off Pioneer Road, not far from Kian Teck Road, where a small community of Thai

workers lived. He was in control of gambling, prostitution and the sale of drugs in the

area, which is referred to by Thai workers as ‘Kian Teck’, a name which will,

for convenience, be used in this judgment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4.        Ten days

before Yaou was killed, Thongthot’s girlfriend, Wena Awaburt (‘Wena’), went

to Kian Teck with a female friend, a Thai prostitute. While Wena was seated on a discarded

bed in Kian Teck, Yaou approached her. He was not pleased to find her at Kian Teck and

showed his displeasure by telling her ‘not to do a man’s job’. He then

pointed a knife at her and warned her that he would arrange to have her raped and silenced

if she was seen in the area again. Wena left in tears and reported the incident to

Thongthot, who lived with a number of other Thai workers in a squatter settlement in a

forested area off Jalan Bahar.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5.        Thongthot

was angered by Yaou’s treatment of Wena. Within a few days, he went with six other

men to Kian Teck to look for Yaou. According to him, the purpose of this trip to Kian Teck

was to ask Yaou to apologise to Wena. However, they did not manage to find Yaou.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6.        A few days

later, Thongthot was informed that Yaou was sighted in Kian Teck. On 2 June 2001, he

assembled another group of men to confront Yaou. This group included the second appellant,

Dornchinnamat, and four other Thai men. The six men gathered at Jalan Bahar for drinks

from 6 pm onwards and left for Kian Teck by taxi at around 10 pm. They were armed and

their deadly arsenal of weapons, which were concealed in umbrellas, included knives,

parangs, a long sword and a variety of metal chains.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">7.        After

arriving at Kian Teck, Thongthot and his men managed to locate Yaou, who was with his

girlfriend, Namphakdee Thapanee (‘Nam’). During the confrontation, Yaou tried to

flee from Thongthot and his gang but he was soon cornered and killed by them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8.        A

pathologist, Dr Paul Chui, gave evidence that the injuries inflicted on Yaou were

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause his death. He pointed out that there

were at least three injuries, each of which was sufficient to result in Yaou’s death.

An injury at the back of Yaou’s head was particularly gruesome. The wound was so deep

that Yaou’s brain and spinal cord were cut.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<ol start="2" type="A">
<li><p align="center"><font size="3">THE TRIAL</font></p></li></ol></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9.        At the

trial, the prosecution asserted that Thongthot, Dornchinnamat and their gang went to Kian

Teck on 2 June 2001 with the common object of causing grievous hurt to Yaou. As such, it

was submitted that they and the other four men in their gang were members of an unlawful

assembly by virtue of section 141 of the Penal Code, which provides, inter alia, as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an

  ‘unlawful assembly’ if the common object of the

  persons        composing that assembly is –</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c)    to commit any mischief or criminal

  trespass, or other offence.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10.      The prosecution also

asserted that the members of the unlawful assembly knew that if their common object was to

be achieved, it was likely that Yaou would be killed. In view of this, it was submitted

that Thongthot and Dornchinnamat were guilty of murder because of section 149 of the Penal

Code, which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful

  assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of

  that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every

  person who, at the time of committing that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is

  guilty of that offence.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11.     Both Thongthot and

Dornchinnamat admitted that they were part of the gang which confronted Yaou and killed

him on the evening of 2 June 2001. However, they denied that the common object of their

gang was to cause grievous hurt to Yaou. Thongthot, who admitted that he stabbed Yaou,

said that his object was merely to teach Yaou a lesson by getting him to apologise to his

girlfriend, Wena. As for Dornchinnamat, who admitted in his statements to the police that

he participated in the attack on Yaou, he asserted that the incriminating parts in the

said statements were not interpreted to him by the Thai interpreter and did not reflect

what he had told the police. He also said that when the statements were read to him before

he signed them, he did not pay attention as he was under physical and mental stress.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The trial judge’s decision</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12.        The trial

judge said that the main issues before him were whether or not Thongthot and Dornchinnamat

and their gang went to Kian Teck on 2 June 2001 with the common object of causing Yaou

grievous hurt and whether or not the members of the gang knew that Yaou’s death would

be a likely result of what they would do in pursuit of their common object. He did not

believe that Thongthot and his gang merely wanted Yaou to apologise to Wena. He was

convinced that Yaou’s assailants went to Kian Teck fully and dangerously armed to

cause serious and grievous harm to Yaou. He thus accepted that Thongthot and Dornchinnamat

were members of an unlawful assembly and proceeded to consider the effect of section 149

of the Penal Code.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13.        The trial

judge noted that Thongthot admitted in court that he stabbed Yaou with a knife although he

claimed that this was done to ‘stop Yaou from running’, a claim which could not

be believed. He also took into account the fact that Dornchinnamat had confessed to having

played a role in the killing of Yaou and rejected his assertion that he did not

incriminate himself in his statements to the police. The trial judge said that it was

unnecessary for him to re-enact every blow struck during the murder ‘for it does not

matter who struck first, or who struck most or who struck the hardest’. What was

important was that the unlawful assembly had the common object of causing grievous hurt to

Yaou and that its members knew that the pursuit of their common object was likely to

result in Yaou’s death. As Yaou was killed, he held that it was evident from section

149 of the Penal Code that Thongthot and Dornchinnamat had committed murder, an offence

punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font size="3">C. THE APPEAL</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14.        The main

thrust of the appellants’ case was that the trial judge erred when he held that they

wanted to exact revenge on Yaou and that they carried weapons to Kian Teck so that

grievous hurt could be caused to Yaou. Thongthot reiterated that he and the other members

of his gang only intended to extract an apology from Yaou and not to kill him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">15.        It cannot

be disputed that Thongthot and Dornchinnamat and the other members of their gang were, by

virtue of section 141 of the Penal Code, members of an unlawful assembly as there was

ample evidence at the trial that their common object was to cause grievous hurt to Yaou.

The remaining issue before us concerns the application of section 149 of the Penal Code to

the circumstances of this case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">16.        The

meaning of the term ‘common object’ has been considered by the courts on

innumerable occasions. In <i>Chandran v Public Prosecutor, </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6259&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 265</a>, 269, this

court noted as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Section 149 does not require proof of a pre-arranged

  plan and a common intention which a

  prosecution            involving s

  34 of the Code would require. The ‘common object’ under s 149 of the Code must

  not be confused with the ‘common intention’ under s 34 of the Code. Though they

  both deal with what may be called ‘constructive liability’ for crime, it is

  important to see the distinction and the way both sections operate.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">In <i>Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor</i>, Lord Sumner at

  p 7 said:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">There is a difference between object and intention, for

  though their object is common, the intentions of several members may differ and indeed may

  be similar only in the respect that they are all unlawful while the element of

  participation in action which is the leading feature of s 34, is replaced in s 149, by

  membership of the assembly at the time of the committing of the offence. Both sections

  deal with combinations of persons who become punishable as sharers in an offence.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">17.        In our

view, the trial judge cannot be faulted for holding that the appellants and the other

members of the unlawful assembly knew that it was likely that Yaou would be killed when

they acted in pursuit of their common intention to cause him grievous hurt. The appellants

tried to downplay the significance of their deadly arsenal of weapons by asserting that

the weapons were only intended for self-defence. However, it is evident from the

circumstances of the case and the ferocity of the attack on Yaou that this could not have

been the case. If the weapons had indeed been carried by the appellants and the other

members of the unlawful assembly for self-defence, Yaou would not have been killed. After

all, Thongthot testified that Yaou was unarmed and outnumbered and that he was running

away when he was savagely attacked. When questioned, he said as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">           

Q.    So when he got up to run away, he ran away alone?</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">           

A.…. <u><i>[H]e was alone</i></u>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">           

Q.     And he was not carrying any weapons?</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">           

A.     When he got up, <u><i>I don’t see him carry anything</i></u>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">           

Q.     You were at [Yaou’s] side. That means Yaou was not

attacking you when you stabbed him?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">           

A.     No, <u><i>he was running</i></u>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">18.        Thongthot

also shed some light on the common object of the unlawful assembly. When cross-examined,

he said as follows:</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">           

Q.     Wouldn’t [it] have been better to just let Yaou run away?</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><u>
<p></p></u><font size="3">            

A.     <u>You think it’s better if he runs and the others chase

after him and kill him</u>?</font></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">                   

Don’t you think that I … better … stop him?</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">            

Q.    … you think they would have killed him?</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">            

A.     The thing happened was Rang carried a long sword and I

can’t tell what was going to happen when Rang

chased                       

after Yaou at the dark area.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><u>
<p></p></u><font size="3">           

Q.    <u>But you were worried he could have killed Yaou</u></font></i>?

<u xmlns=""><i>

A.    </em><i><u>Yes, your Honour</u>…</i></font><u xmlns="">

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">

<p align="justify"><font size="3">A.    … <i><u>even I can stop

  [them], there were three more that I do not know where they were. They might</u>  

  <u>attack</u> <u>Yaou as well</u></i>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">19.        When

considering the effect of section 149 of the Penal Code in relation to ‘an offence

committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of

that assembly’, it did not escape our attention that all the members of the unlawful

assembly played a part in killing Yaou. Thongthot testified that after he stabbed Yaou

twice, the other members of the unlawful assembly surrounded Yaou and Dornchinnamat

slashed Yaou’s head with great force. Another member of the unlawful assembly then

slashed Yaou on the neck. Dornchinnamat corroborated this evidence when he said that the

other members of his group continued to attack Yaou after he had slashed Yaou on the head.

In these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the assailants knew that it was likely

that their actions in furtherance of their common object of causing Yaou grievous hurt

would result in his death. We thus saw no reason to interfere with the findings and

verdict of the trial judge.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3"> <u><i>The second appellant’s other grounds of

appeal</i></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">20.        Before

concluding, reference will be made to the second appellant’s other grounds of appeal,

which, in our view, had no merit whatsoever. Dornchinnamat asserted that portions of his

own statements to the police and the confession of his co-accused, Thongthot, who

implicated him in the murder of Yaou, should not have been relied upon by the trial judge.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">21.        

Dornchinnamat’s statements to the police will first be considered. As has been

mentioned, he retracted substantial portions of these statements during the trial. He

claimed that the retracted portions of the statements in question did not reflect what he

actually said and that he did not pay attention when his statements were read to him by

the Thai interpreter, Tasneeporn.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">22.        It is

trite law that the retraction by an accused of his confession of guilt does not prevent

the confession from being relied on if the judge believes that it is the truth. (See, for

instance, <i>Yap Sow Keong v Public Prosecutor </i>[1947] MLJ 90 and <i>Ismail bin UK

Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor </i>[1972-1974] SLR 232). The trial judge had reason to

believe that Dornchinnamat was telling the truth when he confessed that he had played a

part in the killing of Yaou. Dornchinnamat’s two long statements were made nearly two

weeks after he was arrested and each of the two-day sessions ended by around 2.15 pm. Both

SSgt Daniel Teo, who recorded the statements, and the Thai interpreter, Tasneeporn,

testified that the recorded statements were made by Dornchinnamat and that he was invited

to amend any part of the statements before acknowledging that they were correct. The

interpreter is an independent party and has no reason to fabricate evidence. Furthermore,

as Dornchinnamat knew that he was facing a capital charge, it is most unlikely that he was

not paying attention when his statements were read to him. We thus agreed with the trial

judge that Dornchinnamat’s confession may be relied upon as evidence of his guilt.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">23.        As for

Dornchinnamat’s assertion that the confession of his co-accused, Thongthot, should

not have been given any weight by the trial judge, the courts have, on numerous occasions,

considered whether or not a confession of an accused may be used against a co-accused. In <i>Chin

Seow Noi v Public Prosecutor </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7883&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 135</a>, this court reiterated that the

conviction of an accused can be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his

co-accused if the confession establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is

guilty. In the present case, there was no incentive for Thongthot to lie about

Dornchinnamat’s role in the murder of Yaou. He had already admitted that he was part

of the gang that took Yaou’s life and his account of the events at Kian Teck on the

evening of 2 June 2001, including the fact that Dornchinnamat slashed Yaou on the head, is

consistent with Dornchinnamat’s own admission in his statements to the police and

with the eye-witness account by Yaou’s girlfriend, Nam. As such, the trial judge was

entitled to take into account Thongthot’s evidence that Dornchinnamat played a role

in the killing of Yaou.</font></p>

Thongthot and Dornchinnamat did not establish that the trial judge erred in finding them
