</div> I am of the view that it would nevertheless have been clear to her that what she provided was contrary and very detrimental to the plaintiff’s alleged position of the Loan. It would also have been obvious to her that this involved a large sum of money. Moreover, she was the one in charge of handling the plaintiff’s accounts. I find it hard to believe that she would simply follow Chan’s instructions, when it was directly contradictory and harmful to her own company’s position, without proof from Chan of the Defendant’s Loan.

According to Chan, sometime around November 2016, he was concerned about recording the Defendant’s Loans. He made an appointment with James. He met with James and Winnie at the plaintiff’s office on 17 November 2016. Chan and James discussed and recorded the Defendant’s Loans and the repayments made by the plaintiff to the defendant up to that date. This led to Winnie’s 17 November 2016 email enclosing the Statement of Account.

There was nothing stopping Winnie from doing the simple task of opening up the attachment sent to her from Wang, to verify that it was the correct document that stated the correct information. In any event, Wang herself testified that Winnie did not give her any instructions to change the template that was being used, which characterised the payments from the plaintiff as repayments to the defendant.

</div> There was no change of personnel, since Li said he was involved in the Project from the beginning and was also in charge of the conduct of this Suit. There is no satisfactory explanation for the three different bases of claims made by the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Neither is there any good explanation for why the plaintiff would have considered there to be a security deposit placed with the defendant. It is the plaintiff’s case that Chua and Li knew of the Loan in early 2015. It is also Chua’s evidence that he prepared ten payment vouchers in 2015 and 2016, at around the time the monies were transferred from the plaintiff to the defendant, which were described as “Company loan to SLH Development”, although they were not counter-signed by Chan. It is also Winnie’s evidence that around November 2016, Chua, Li and James had told her that the monies transferred to the defendant were part of the Loan and not repayments for the Defendant’s Loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Yet despite their alleged awareness of the existence of the Loan since early 2015, and despite Chua’s claims that he took concrete steps in 2015 and 2016 to record the Loan, the plaintiff did not pursue its initial claim against the defendant on the basis of the Loan. Instead, the plaintiff first sought $1.19m from the defendant as payment of unpaid amounts from the agreed contract sum. It then asserted that there was a security deposit placed with the defendant, that should be repaid to the plaintiff. In March 2021, Li testified in his affidavit filed in response to the Defendant’s application to set aside default judgment which had been entered in this matter, that:

It was James who asked for the cheques to be cash cheques, as he said that he needed to pay contractors and he could not wait. Chan, as signatory of the defendant’s bank account, would prepare a cash cheque for the requested amount. Ong and Chan would proceed to a United Overseas Bank branch to cash the cheque in. James would then receive the cash. The plaintiff would at the same time issue a cheque to the defendant for a certain amount, with which it would be able to repay Chan. The plaintiff would raise a Project Claim after works were done. After the defendant made payment of the Project Claim, the defendant would bank in the cheque that had been issued by the plaintiff, as partial payment of the aggregated loan amounts.

</div> Chan testified that he was initially a little uneasy giving cash and was also concerned about whether the cash advances would be repaid. However, as he was given a cheque by the plaintiff in return, this served as a set-off of the advances he gave against the progress claims.

</div> He also became more assured after the first repayment cheque cleared and thus continued to make the cash advances. He did not keep proper records as the defendant only comprised of him, and he did not have any staff. He did however ask James for a record of the advances made, which resulted in the 17 Nov 16 Email and the 17 Nov 16 Account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Chan testified that James later helped him with the renovation for his bungalow. While the value of that work did not equate with the remainder of the debt, he appreciated James’ willingness to work towards repayment of the debt. He also testified that he was conscious that the plaintiff’s bid was lower than other main contractors who had tendered for the Project.

</div>
</div> He accordingly treated James’ work on the bungalow as sufficient repayment of the remainder of the Defendant’s Loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I find that Chan’s explanation satisfactorily addresses the questions posed by the plaintiff about his mode of providing the loans to James. It is undisputed that Chan operated without assistance. He had his own system of organising things, and his own approach to checks and balances. The plaintiff submits that Chan’s claims are not credible as he did not keep proper record of the loans he made, but on Chan’s evidence, he had asked James for a list of the loans made to the plaintiff. This led to Winnie’s email enclosing the 17 Nov 16 Account, which was signed by James and contained the plaintiff’s company stamp. This serves effectively as Chan’s record of the loan. While the transfers in Chan’s payment vouchers do not entirely match the payments reflected in the repayment schedule sent by Winnie, the fact that almost every transfer matches, supports Chan’s evidence that he had provided such monies as a loan to the plaintiff. As set out above, it is also important that James himself, who was the person in charge on the plaintiff’s side, had signed off and put the company stamp on the 17 Nov 2016 Account that Winnie emailed to Chan. In doing so, the plaintiff was affirming that the repayments were for a loan made to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiff highlights that the defendant’s financial statements for 2015 to 2017 do not indicate any loans from the defendant to the plaintiff and submits that this supports the plaintiff’s case that there was no Defendant’s Loan. Chan’s explains that the loan monies “came from company accounts from director account”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was from his own money which does not belong to the company.

</div>
</div> It is undisputed that the defendant is a company that is wholly owned by Chan. It is dependent ultimately on personal funding by Chan. Where he provides loans to facilitate the business of the defendant, it is within his power to subsequently reclaim such monies from the defendant. In my view, Chan has provided an acceptable explanation for why he did not record the Defendant’s Loans on the defendant’s financial statements. That James chose to make the repayments back to the defendant (rather than Chan personally) and titled the 17 Nov 16 Account as repayment for advances made to the plaintiff in relation to the Project, reinforces Chan’s evidence of the Defendant’s Loan.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The plaintiff also submits that the relationship between Ong and Chan is suspicious, and it is likely that Ong took the monies advanced by Chan, rather than James or the plaintiff. Ong denies ever having taken loans from Chan. Chan also asserts that he has never provided personal loans to Ong. During cross-examination of Ong, the plaintiff referred Ong to a schedule of payment titled as “Ong Pang Heng Daniel Personal Loans”. Wang testified that this schedule was prepared by her. She did not know if there were loans from the defendant to Ong. She simply saw that the monies in the transactions in this schedule was not received by the plaintiff, and the payment vouchers showed that Ong received the monies, so she grouped them into another table. The schedule titled “Ong Pang Heng Daniel Personal Loans” hence does not constitute documentary evidence that Ong took personal loans. There is thus no evidence that Ong took the monies documented in Chan’s payment vouchers, beyond the plaintiff’s pure speculation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Chan was an evasive witness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff submits that Chan is not a reliable witness as he tends to be evasive and tailor his evidence. I do not find this to be so. Chan is 76 years old and is hard of hearing. He uses a hearing aid. Counsel for the defendant had highlighted this before the cross-examination began and asked that questions be put to Chan slowly and clearly.

</div> Li thus filed a police report. As of the date of the parties’ closing submissions, no charges or legal proceedings has been brought against Chan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The defendant takes the position that Chan had not perjured himself at trial. Any inconsistencies in his responses to counsel for the plaintiff’s questioning about the alleged perjury is explainable by Chan’s elderly age and hearing disability, as well as his clear confusion by the questions, as seen from the transcript.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Even if the plaintiff’s case on this is taken at its highest, and Chan is eventually found guilty of the alleged perjury, I find that it does not affect the assessment of the evidence regarding the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Preliminarily, the fact that a witness has lied on one or two points does not mean that all of their evidence must be rejected.

In the present case, I find that Chan’s evidence regarding the existence of the Defendant’s Loan and the absence of the Loan is strongly supported by the plaintiff’s own documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 More importantly, even if Chan perjured in respect of whether he saw Ong or spoke to him on the morning of the hearing, that does not mean that the Loan existed. Even before Chan’s evidence is considered, I find that the plaintiff’s case is already substantially undermined by its own documentary evidence. This is further compounded by the inconsistencies in the evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses about its claim and the Loan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Assessing the evidence on the whole, I find that the plaintiff has not proven that it extended the Loan to the defendant. Instead, the evidence clearly shows that the payments from the plaintiff were a repayment to the defendant for monies advanced to the plaintiff from the defendant. Consequently, the issue of a presumed resulting trust, raised by the plaintiff, does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff had garnished the defendant’s bank account, for the total sum of $86,355.33.
