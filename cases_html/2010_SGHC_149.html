        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant company, Refco (Singapore) Pte
                    Ltd, was incorporated in February 1984 and went into members’ voluntary
                    liquidation on 30 November 2006. The plaintiff, Tan Hup Thye, was an
                    employee of the defendant from the time of its incorporation up to
                    4 December 2005. Starting out as an executive vice president, the plaintiff
                    became managing director of the defendant in November 1986, a position that he
                    held up to 4 December 2005. Thereafter, he remained a director of the
                    defendant until the liquidation proceedings started. The defendant was part of a
                    group of companies which I shall call “the Refco Group”. Its
                    immediate holding company was Refco Global Holdings LLC but its ultimate
                    shareholder was Refco Inc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 4 December 2005, the defendant’s
                    business was transferred to Man Financial (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Man
                    (S)”) as part of a sale and transfer of some of the businesses belonging
                    to companies in the Refco Group. Pursuant to the sale and transfer of the
                    defendant’s business, the plaintiff was offered and accepted employment
                    with Man (S) on 5 December 2005. This employment was, however, terminated
                    on the same day pursuant to a termination agreement which also contained a
                    generous termination package for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff’s claim herein is for bonus
                    entitlements from the defendant which he alleges that he is entitled to in
                    respect of his employment with the defendant from 1 March 2005 (the
                    beginning of the defendant’s financial year) to 4 December 2005. The
                    claim is for a total sum of $1,460,442.03. This sum is made up as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     a sum of $1,412,759.00 for the seven
                        months from 1 March 2005 to 30 September 2005;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     a sum of
                        $47,683.03 for the months of October and November 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff has put forward two bases for his
                    claim. They are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     The claim for the sum of $1,412,759
                        is based on the specific sum approved and declared as the plaintiff’s
                        bonus in a Board of Directors’ resolution passed on 3 December
                        2005 (“the December Resolution”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     The bonus sum of $1,412,759 is also
                        allegedly a contractual entitlement of the plaintiff. This contractual
                        entitlement extends to the further sum of $47,683.03 for the months of
                        October and November 2005. The plaintiff says that the bonus payable to him
                        is from bonus accrued in the defendant’s accounts in the course of the
                        defendant’s financial year. Allegedly, the bonus was accrued based on
                        a bonus formula of 30% of net profits before tax adjusted for cost of
                        capital (“the Bonus Formula”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant’s position is that the
                    plaintiff is not entitled to the moneys he is claiming. This is on the basis
                    that first, the plaintiff has no contractual rights to the sums he is claiming
                    and second, that he is not entitled to claim bonuses on the basis of the
                    December Resolution because the resolution is allegedly invalid or,
                    alternatively, the declaration of bonuses under the December Resolution was in
                    breach of the plaintiff’s fiduciary duties owed to the defendant. Further,
                    the defendant is also, by way of a counterclaim, claiming damages and/or an
                    indemnity against the plaintiff for losses arising out of the plaintiff’s
                    breach of fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At all material times, the defendant was in the
                    business of providing securities dealing services and broking services in
                    financial futures contracts, foreign exchange and commodities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As of August 2005, the board of directors of the
                    defendant comprised:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Philip Roger Bennett
                            (“Mr Bennett”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Santo Charles Maggio
                            (“Mr Maggio”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Keith Tay Ah Kee
                            (“Mr Tay”).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Maggio held the position of Chief Executive Officer of two
                    other companies in the Refco Group while Mr Bennett was the Chairman and a
                    director of the defendant from April 1984. Until 1998, Mr Bennett was the
                    chief financial officer of Refco Group Ltd (another company in Refco Group) and
                    from then, he held the post of president and chief executive officer of Refco
                    Group Ltd. Mr Tay was an independent director who had been appointed in
                    1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In August 2005, the Refco Group was restructured
                    and a company called Refco Inc was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In
                    October 2005, Refco Inc announced that it had discovered a receivable of about
                    US$430m owing to it which Mr Bennett had not disclosed. Mr Bennett and
                    Mr Maggio were subsequently charged in the United States for securities
                    fraud. As a consequence of the announcement, Refco Inc’s share price fell
                    and on 17 October 2005, Refco Inc filed for and secured bankruptcy
                    protection in the United States.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Later in October 2005, AlixPartners LLC was
                    retained by Refco Inc to, <em>inter alia</em>, assist with
                    the potential sale of Refco Inc’s businesses, including the defendant.
                    AlixPartners LLC appointed KordaMentha, an Australian firm, to oversee the Refco
                    Group of companies’ subsidiaries in Asia, including the defendant. As
                    regards the defendant, David Winterbottom (“Mr Winterbottom),
                    Cameron Duncan and John Mouwad were appointed by KordaMentha to oversee
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 16 November 2005, Robert Dangremond
                    (“Mr Dangremond”) was appointed interim CEO of Refco
                    Inc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 13 November 2005, it was agreed that
                    Man Financial Inc would acquire the business of the Refco Group, including the
                    defendant, pursuant to the terms of an acquisition agreement (“the
                    Acquisition Agreement”) of that date made between Man Financial Inc as
                    the buyer and various members of the Refco Group, including the defendant, as
                    sellers. As regards the defendant, it was agreed that the defendant’s
                    assets and business operations were to be taken over by Man (S) on
                    5 December 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the meantime, the plaintiff had informed
                    Mr Winterbottom of his intention to make bonus payments to the
                    defendant’s employees, at the very latest by 26 October 2005. The
                    next month, the defendant’s board sought a legal opinion from the
                    defendant’s lawyers, Messrs Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“RT”), as
                    to whether its employees were legally entitled to be paid bonuses prior to and
                    as part of the orderly winding down of the business of the defendant. The legal
                    opinion was issued on 18 November 2005 and the plaintiff considered that it
                    supported the view that the defendant was entitled to pay the staff bonuses
                    prior to and as part of an orderly transfer of the defendant’s business to
                    Man (S) as long as the employees satisfied the bonus criteria.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 21 November 2005, a board meeting was
                    held. The plaintiff attended the meeting in person and Mr Tay attended it
                    via teleconference. Two other employees of the defendant were in attendance. At
                    this meeting, a resolution was passed (“the November resolution”),
                    approving the payment of bonus to the defendant’s employees totalling
                    $6,485,094. Later that same day, the plaintiff received an e-mail from Refco
                    Inc’s general counsel, Dennis Klejna, telling him not to make any bonus
                    payment without the approval of the Refco Inc board. On 22 November 2005,
                    other representatives from Refco Inc, including Mr Dangremond, told the
                    plaintiff not to make the bonus payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 3 December 2005, the defendant’s
                    board of directors held a meeting (“the December meeting”) at
                    which they, <em>inter alia</em>, passed a resolution
                    (“the December Resolution”) approving the allocation of bonuses to
                    individual employees as per a detailed bonus list. This list set out the amount
                    of bonus payable to each of the defendant’s employees including the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 4 December 2005, Laurence
                    O’Connell (“Mr O’Connell”) from Man (S) informed
                    the plaintiff that he should not communicate the November and December Board
                    Resolutions to the employees of the defendant. The plaintiff suggested that Man
                    (S) provide a specific assurance in its letters to the employees that Man
                    Financial Inc would honour applicable bonus entitlements.
                    Mr O’Connell agreed to this suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 5 December 2005, Man (S) took over the
                    business of the defendant and subsumed it within its own business. Pursuant to
                    the Acquisition Agreement, a transfer agreement was entered into and the
                    defendant’s employees were transferred to Man (S). On the same day, the
                    employment of the plaintiff and some of the senior members of his management
                    team was terminated by Man (S).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The main issues as framed by the plaintiff
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the plaintiff is entitled to
                        his bonus payments pursuant to the December Resolution;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether, in the alternative, the
                        plaintiff is contractually entitled to his bonus payments;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the
                        plaintiff was in breach of his fiduciary duties and duties of fidelity owed
                        to the defendant and therefore liable for payments made by the defendant
                        pursuant to settlement agreements with its
                ex-employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Claim under the December Resolution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff’s position is that the
                    December Resolution approved the specific bonus payments to each of the
                    defendant’s employees as set out in a bonus list presented to the board.
                    The plaintiff says that notice of the December meeting was duly given to all
                    directors and the meeting was attended by the plaintiff and Mr Tay who
                    formed a quorum and passed the December Resolution. The December meeting was
                    duly minuted and the minutes are evidence of what was decided at the meeting.
                    Accordingly, the defendant has an obligation to pay the plaintiff his bonus as
                    contained in the bonus list and approved by the board in the December
                    Resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant’s position is that the
                    plaintiff is not entitled to rely on the December Resolution because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no quorum at the December
                        meeting; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     the December Resolution was not in the best interests of the defendant and
                        the plaintiff had therefore acted in breach of his fiduciary duties when he
                        passed the December Resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 6.0 of the minutes of the December
                    meeting reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6.0     DECLARATION OF BONUS</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">David Yeow explained to the Board that there were case law precedents
                            in the UK that bonus payment was not discretionary but was a contractual
                            entitlement although the employee’s contract said that it was
                            discretionary. Such case law should be taken into account due to the
                            statutory provision that case law precedents in the United Kingdom would
                            form part of the laws of England.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Board having reviewed the legal opinion received from Rajah &amp;

                            contractual obligation on the part of the Company but that the Company
                            needed to determine the quantum of bonus on a reasonable basis, after

                            (Exhibit 2) received no response objecting to what was proposed
                            therein; the board resolved that consistently with past practice and the
                            performance criteria applied bonus be paid to the employees of the
                            Company as at 3 December 2005 based on the profits earned by the
                            Company (combined with profits earned by Refco Investment Services Pte
                            Ltd) for the period 1 March 2005 to 30 September 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Board also resolved:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">That the specific bonus payable to each employee set out in
                            Exhibit 3 be notified to the liquidators of the Company (following
                            its voluntary member’s winding up after the sale and completion of
                            its transfer of business to Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd) for the
                            liquidators [<em>sic</em>] follow up action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the December Resolution invalid by reason of conflict of interest
                and insufficient quorum?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant pointed out that as a director
                    of the defendant, the plaintiff was statutorily required to act honestly at all
                    times and to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties. He also
                    owed the defendant fiduciary duties to act <em>bona
                        fide</em> in its interest, not to place himself in a position of
                    conflict <em>vis-à-vis</em> the defendant and to exercise
                    his powers for their proper purposes. The submission was that in approving the
                    December Resolution which provided for bonus to be paid to himself as well as to
                    other employees, the plaintiff had breached these duties and had placed himself
                    in a position of conflict.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendant relied on Article 83 of its
                    Articles of Association (“the Articles”) which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A director shall not vote in respect of any contract or proposed contract
                        with the company in which he is interested, or any matter arising thereout,
                        and if he does so vote his vote shall not be counted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It submitted that as the issue of bonus payments was a matter arising
                    out of or related to the plaintiff’s contract of employment, he was
                    prohibited from voting on his own bonus. The defendant cited <em>Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver</em> [1967] 2 AC 134 and
                        <em>Furs Ltd v Tomkies</em> 54 CLR 583
                        (“<em>Furs Ltd</em>”) in support of the
                    proposition that the law does not allow a director to make use of his position
                    to obtain a profit for himself. In <em>Furs Ltd</em>, the
                    Australian High Court had stated that a director shall not obtain for himself a
                    profit by means of a transaction in which he is concerned on behalf of the
                    company unless all the material facts are disclosed to the shareholders and the
                    shareholders approve such profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the defendant submitted,
                    the plaintiff had used his position as the managing director of the defendant to
                    cause the passing of the December Resolution which declared that the plaintiff
                    was to be paid the sum of $1,412,759 in bonus. Refco Inc, the defendant’s
                    ultimate shareholder, had hitherto expressly instructed the plaintiff that no
                    bonuses were to be paid out. Thus, if the plaintiff were allowed to rely on the
                    December Resolution to claim bonus, he would have made use of his fiduciary
                    position to secure an unauthorised gain for himself. Further, there was no
                    quorum at the meeting. Since the Articles required two directors to be present
                    and the plaintiff’s attendance could not be counted in the quorum since
                    under Article 83, he was not entitled to vote. In this respect, the
                    defendant relied on <em>In re Greymouth Point Elizabeth Railway
                        and Coal Company Limited</em> [1904] 1 Ch 32 <em>(</em>“<em>In re
                    Greymouth</em>”) where it was held that a quorum of directors meant
                    a quorum competent to transact and vote on the business before the
                board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Dealing with the issue of conflict of
                    interest, the plaintiff submitted that the no conflict rule was only relevant if
                    he had placed himself in a position where there was an actual or substantial
                    possibility of a conflict between his personal interest and his duty to act in
                    the interest of the company. The test to be applied was whether a reasonable man
                    looking at the relevant facts and circumstances would think there was a real and
                    sensible possibility of conflict. In this case, the plaintiff had been a
                    director and managing director of the defendant for more than 20 years and had
                    constantly been fine-tuning the remuneration structure and policy of the
                    defendant. Under the remuneration policy introduced for the financial year
                    ending 1996, the plaintiff determined the bonus payable to individual employees
                    including the plaintiff himself. The plaintiff had made decisions on bonus
                    payments throughout the period for all staff members and he could not be in a
                    position of conflict simply because the management decision that he was making
                    also benefited him. The plaintiff had testified that the December Resolution had
                    benefited more than 200 employees of the defendant and since it was a vote in
                    relation to an existing contractual relationship, it did not create a new
                    contract or new entitlement. To him, it was a vote in the normal course of
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff also submitted that
                    Article 83 was not applicable because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     Article 83 did not prevent a
                        director from voting in respect of a matter in which he had an interest but
                        only in respect of a contract or proposed contract in which he was
                        interested. The decision of the board to quantify the specific amount of
                        bonus to be paid to the defendant’s employees could not be a contract
                        or proposed contract with the defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     During cross-examination, Mr Winterbottom
                        had taken the position that the contract mentioned in Article 83 would
                        be “the contract constituted by the resolution”. This position
                        was inconsistent with the defendant’s case that there was no
                        contractual obligation to pay its employees bonuses. Also, the resolution
                        could not be a contract because there was no offer and
                    acceptance;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     While
                        the plaintiff had an interest in the November and December Resolutions, this
                        was also the case for all decisions taken by the plaintiff in respect of the
                        defendant’s employment matters as the plaintiff was himself an
                        employee. If the defendant was right then all decisions taken by the board
                        in which the plaintiff participated concerning the defendant’s
                        employees over the previous 20 years would be called into
                    question;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     Based on
                        the past practices of the defendant, it could not be refuted that the board
                        had vested the plaintiff with the authority to allocate the bonus payments
                        to the employees. No resolutions had been passed prior to 2005 to approve
                        the bonus payments and therefore it was illogical to say that if the same
                        issue was placed before the board in a formal meeting, the plaintiff could
                        not vote on it because of Article 83. By vesting the authority in the
                        plaintiff, the board had accepted that the plaintiff could decide on the
                        bonus allocation of all employees including himself; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_e"></a>(e)     The fact that the plaintiff was also
                        receiving the bonus under the December Resolution was disclosed to the
                        board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I take a different view on Article 83
                    from that of the plaintiff. The article prevents a director of a company from
                    voting on a contract or proposed contract with the company or “any matter
                    arising thereout” if he is interested in the same. The addition of the
                    words “any matter arising thereout” makes it plain that the
                    prohibition does not relate only to contracts or proposed contracts which are
                    currently before the board but also relates to matters which arise from
                    pre-existing contracts. As the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant, there
                    was a contractual relationship between him and the defendant which governed his
                    employment and one of the terms of this contractual relationship concerned the
                    remuneration to which the plaintiff was entitled from time to time. Looked at
                    from this perspective, the question of whether a bonus was payable to the
                    plaintiff for the period from March to September 2003 and if so what the amount
                    of the same should be, would plainly be a matter arising out of a contract in
                    which the plaintiff had an interest. Accordingly, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, the plaintiff was prohibited from voting on his bonus and,
                    since in the event, he did vote, that vote should not have been
                counted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It should also be emphasised that the
                    plaintiff’s bonus entitlement was not simply an incidental part of the
                    bonus declaration. The bonus list provided for a total sum of $6,485,097 to be
                    distributed as bonus among more than 180 employees in the defendant’s
                    offices in Singapore and elsewhere. Of this amount, the plaintiff was to receive
                    $1,412,759.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the case of <em>In re
                        Greymouth</em> cited in [23] above, Farwell J was faced with a
                    situation where a board meeting attended by three directors had approved the
                    issue of debentures to two of them. The company’s articles were very
                    similar to those before me in that they provided for a quorum of two and that
                    directors could not vote on matters relating to “contract, operation,
                    business, or office” in which they were interested and if they did so
                    vote the vote should not be counted. The judge held (at [34]) that the meaning
                    of the article relating to quorum was that the two directors to form the quorum
                    for the despatch of business had to be two directors who were capable of voting
                    on the business before the board; otherwise the article would be idle. As two of
                    the three directors who purportedly attended the meeting were not capable of
                    voting on the question of giving security to themselves, there was no quorum and
                    no valid resolution for the issue of the debentures to them. The case has stood
                    for the proposition that directors who are not capable of voting on any question
                    before the board cannot be counted as part of the quorum of the board for that
                    purpose for more than 100 years. Although it is a first instance decision, I
                    think that it is correct in principle since allowing directors with an interest
                    in a proposed contract to form part of the quorum of a meeting even though they
                    cannot vote on the issue before the meeting would permit the purpose of articles
                    like Article 83 to be negated or undermined. If the articles specify a
                    certain quorum for a meeting, that means that the basic element for the
                    constitution of the meeting is the attendance of that specified number of
                    persons being persons who are able to discuss and vote on the issues before the
                    meeting. Otherwise there would be no point in specifying a quorum at all. It is
                    worth pointing out that a company is free to decide how to regulate itself and
                    the articles of the defendant could very well have provided that a director may
                    vote in matters in which he is interested. In this case, however,
                    Article 83 did not take that path.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff’s argument that there was
                    no breach of Article 83 because Mr Winterbottom had testified that the
                    “contract” referred to in Article 83 was the “contract
                    constituted by the resolution” cannot be sustained. Mr Winterbottom
                    as a lay person was not in the position to interpret the legal meaning of
                    “contract” in Article 83. The interpretation of
                    Article 83 is a question of law not fact and I agree with the
                    defendant’s submission that the plain and ordinary meaning of the words
                    “contract … with the company” must include a
                    director’s contract of employment with the company. Article 83 was
                    designed to prevent a director (as a fiduciary) from breaching the rule against
                    self-dealing. In the English case of <em>Neptune (Vehicle Washing
                        Equipment) Ltd v Fitzgerald</em> [1996] 1 Ch 274
                        (“<em>Neptune</em>”), Lightman J
                    stated the law thus at 279:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A director of a company owes a fiduciary duty to the company to act bona
                        fide in the best interests of the company and to prefer its interests to his
                        own where they conflict. If a director on behalf of the company enters into
                        any arrangement or transaction with himself or with a company or firm in
                        which he is interested, that arrangement or transaction may be set aside
                        without inquiry as to whether the company has suffered thereby (“the
                        self-dealing rule”); but it is a defence to such a claim that the
                        shareholders of the company have consented to the transaction, and if the
                        articles of association of the company provide that a director may vote in
                        matters in which he is interested the self-dealing rule is excluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clearly, the plaintiff was interested in a bonus arrangement under
                    which he would gain substantial extra remuneration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff argued that it could not be
                    refuted that the defendant’s board had vested the plaintiff with the
                    authority to allocate the bonus payments for its employees. Prior to 2005, no
                    resolutions had ever been passed to approve the bonus payment. It therefore did
                    not stand to reason that if the same issue was placed before the board in a
                    formal meeting, the plaintiff could not vote on it because of Article 83.
                    By vesting the authority in the plaintiff, the board had accepted that he could
                    decide on the bonus allocation of all employees, himself included.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff cited the case of <em>Golden Harvest Films Distribution (Pte) Ltd v Golden Village
                        Multiplex Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 940 for the
                    proposition that where articles are silent it may be possible to invoke past
                    practices to “fill in the gaps” (at [46]). He submitted that
                    where:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     a director has been authorised to
                        carry out a certain act on behalf of the company in which he has an
                        interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        director’s interest is known to the Board and its shareholders;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        director has been carrying out the act for many years;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">these factors constitute relevant past practices which should be taken into
                    account when determining the applicability of Article 83. The plaintiff had
                    been allocated his bonus under the remuneration policy in force since 1996 and
                    it would be wrong to ignore this fact now and rely on an excessively literal
                    interpretation of Article 83.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The evidence, however, showed that the
                    question of bonus had not gone to the board prior to 2005 because during the
                    preceding years, the plaintiff had always consulted with Mr Bennett on the
                    bonus to be allocated to the employees and had only proceeded with such
                    allocation after he obtained Mr Bennett’s approval. There was no
                    precedent for the December Resolution and the defendant had not established a
                    practice which ignored the provisions of Article 83 and permitted the
                    plaintiff to vote in favour of his own bonus payment. The plaintiff during
                    cross-examination admitted that during the period from 1996 to 2005, he had
                    consistently sought approval from the defendant’s shareholders to pay
                    bonuses for those years. The documentary evidence showed that at the end of each
                    financial year, the plaintiff would write to Mr Bennett seeking his
                    approval before the specific bonus amounts were paid out. The plaintiff also
                    agreed that when he sought Mr Bennett’s approval for the bonus
                    formula, he had consulted Mr Bennett in his capacity as a
                    shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The passage from <em>Neptune</em> cited at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above
                    states plainly that the shareholders can exempt an officer of the company from
                    compliance with the rule against self-dealing. During the years when the
                    plaintiff consulted with Mr Bennett on the bonus allocation, this is what
                    happened. The applicability of Article 83 did not need to be considered. It
                    was only after Mr Bennett was no longer able to represent the shareholders
                    and Mr Dangremond as the shareholders’ representative instructed him
                    not to pay bonus that the plaintiff had to consider a different route for
                    approval of bonus payments. That was when the December Resolution was passed and
                    Article 83 came into play. I find therefore that there was no practice in
                    the defendant that provided for the strict terms of Article 83 to be
                    ignored if a director’s resolution had to be passed to approve a bonus
                    payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the December Resolution in the defendant’s best
                interests?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Assuming that I am wrong in concluding that
                    Article 83 applied to the December Resolution, I must consider whether that
                    resolution should be invalidated on the basis that the plaintiff acted in breach
                    of fiduciary duties when he passed it. The main question to determine here is
                    whether the December Resolution was passed in the best interests of the
                    defendant. As stated earlier, the defendant’s shareholders had not
                    consented to any payment of bonus. In fact, on 22 November 2005, the
                    plaintiff had written to Mr Dangremond to seek the consent and approval of
                    Refco Inc “as the Manager of our holding company Refco Global Holdings
                    LLC” to make bonus payments to the employees for the period 1 March
                    2005 to 30 September 2005. On 23 November 2005, Mr Dangremond
                    instructed the plaintiff that he was not to make any payment of bonus and that
                    there was “no room” to discuss the issue as the Refco Inc board
                    would not approve the payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The defendant argued that when a company is
                    solvent, the interests of the shareholders of the company should, generally, be
                    regarded as the interests of the company. Where the company is to be sold, the
                    interests of the company would even more acutely reflect the interests of the
                    shareholders, particularly where the shareholders are in financial trouble. This
                    is because the very purpose of the sale would be to ensure that the assets to be
                    distributed to and among the shareholders are maximised. Accordingly, it
                    submitted that Refco Inc’s interests were at all material times
                    representative of the defendant’s interests and that when the plaintiff
                    failed to follow Refco Inc’s directions that no bonuses were to be paid,
                    he failed to act in the best interests of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the case of a private company like the
                    defendant, which has been set up for commercial purposes, what are in its bests
                    interests must generally be assessed with regard to what actions would enable
                    the company to carry on its business efficiently, profitably and legally. Such
                    actions would generally include paying adequate remuneration, including bonus,
                    to capable staff. The conclusion of the Acquisition Agreement changed the
                    situation in relation to the defendant because the purpose of that agreement was
                    for the defendant to sell its business to Man Financial. Thereafter the actions
                    that would be in the best interests of the defendant were those actions that
                    would promote the smooth conclusion of the sale and assist the defendant in
                    meeting its legal obligations under the Acquisition Agreement. There would be no
                    need to pay bonus to retain staff unless doing so would further the sale or
                    avoid unprofitable litigation. In the absence of such a need, the
                    defendant’s main interest would lie in procuring that after the completion
                    of the sale it would have as much cash in its account as possible to be
                    available to its shareholders on its voluntary winding up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Acquisition Agreement provided in
                    s 8.1(d) that each of the parties would not “make any commitments to
                    pay on or after the Closing Date any bonuses or other benefits to employees of
                    the Business other than in the ordinary course of business”. The
                    defendant was thereby under a contractual obligation not to pay bonuses to its
                    employees except in the ordinary course of business. The December Resolution was
                    not passed in the ordinary course of business as the general policy of the
                    defendant was to declare and pay bonuses only after the end of its financial
                    year. At the time of the December Resolution, the 2005/2006 financial year had
                    not ended yet. Thus, the passing of the resolution, if it created an obligation
                    to pay bonuses to the employees of the defendant, would cause the defendant to
                    be in breach of the Acquisition Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff argued that the objection as to
                    timing was misconceived and that the December Resolution did not authorise the
                    payment of any bonuses before the end of the financial year. The December
                    Resolution had provided that the bonus was to be notified to the liquidators of
                    the defendant for the liquidators’ follow up action. The defendant was
                    placed in members’ voluntary winding-up on 30 November 2006 and this
                    date was well after the end of the defendant’s financial year on 28
                    February 2006. Based on the December Resolution, the defendant would only need
                    to pay the bonuses after 30 November 2006. The plaintiff’s argument
                    misses the point because, as noted above, the defendant in the ordinary course
                    of events decided whether to declare a bonus (and if so how much) after the end
                    of the financial year. The ordinary practice of the defendant was that if it
                    decided to declare a bonus, it would do so for the entire financial year unlike
                    the December Resolution which accelerated the bonus payment and declared bonuses
                    only for seven months. Further, the plaintiff could not have believed that the
                    bonuses declared by the December Resolution were payable only after the end of
                    the financial year because, in his claim herein, he had prayed for interest to
                    be paid to him on the amount of his bonus “from 4 December 2005
                    until payment”. There was no basis to make a claim for interest from
                    4 December 2005 if, in the plaintiff’s opinion, the bonus was only
                    payable after 28 February 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     When Man Financial learnt about the December
                    Resolution, its Mr O’Connell informed the plaintiff that he should
                    not notify the employees of the defendant of the December Resolution and warned
                    him:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please be advised that we are insistent that you must not take this
                        action, and, that if you do take such action you are acting in breach of the
                        obligations of Refco under the Agreement, against the interests of the Refco
                        estate and Man Financial. Further, by taking this action you will put in
                        serious jeapardy [<em>sic</em>] the intention to close
                        the Singapore transaction to-day as intended …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is therefore my view, that by procuring the
                    passing of the December Resolution, the plaintiff <em>prima
                        facie</em> put the defendant in breach of the Acquisition Agreement
                    and this was an action that could not be in the interests of the defendant. I
                    must immediately add a caveat to the foregoing opinion. If the defendant was
                    contractually obliged to pay its employees bonuses, then it would be highly
                    arguable whether it was in the defendant’s interests to take action to
                    fulfil that obligation even though it caused a breach of the Acquisition
                    Agreement because otherwise the defendant would have been in breach of its
                    contracts with its employees and open to suit by them. I have to consider
                    whether there was such a contractual obligation. If there was, it would be
                    difficult to state categorically that the passing of the December Resolution was
                    not in the defendant’s best interests. The issue of contractual liability
                    is also important as it is the second basis of the plaintiff’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Before I leave this point, I should avert to
                    the plaintiff’s reasons for passing the December Resolution. In his
                    affidavit of evidence in chief, the plaintiff stated several bases for passing
                    the December Resolution:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Acquisition Agreement
                        “imposed an obligation to preserve the current business organisation
                        of the Defendant” (at para 79);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     “[N]early all employees were unhappy,
                        restive and apprehensive about the takeover” of the defendant by Man
                        (S) (at para 78);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     He “strongly felt that the Defendant’s
                        management had a duty and obligation to honour the salary and bonus
                        entitlements due to the employees who had worked hard to produce the record
                        performance for the year 2005” (at para 79(1));
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     The legal
                        opinion of the defendant’s then solicitors, RT, was that “the
                        employees of the Defendant are entitled to be paid bonus[es] so long as they
                        satisfy the bonus criteria, the Defendant was entitled to pay the bonus[es]
                        prior to and as part of an orderly transfer of its business to Man
                        [(S)]” (at para 80(1)(ii)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The points made by the plaintiff, except for
                    the last, do not establish that the December Resolution was in the best
                    interests of the defendant. First, whilst there was a general obligation under
                    the Acquisition Agreement to preserve the current business organisation of the
                    defendant, this could not be read to allow a flouting of the obligation not to
                    pay bonuses. Second, the plaintiff did not bring any evidence to show that
                    nearly all the employees were “unhappy, restive and apprehensive”
                    about the takeover of the defendant or how the passing of the December
                    Resolution would have made any difference to this. Sections 8.17(a) and (b) of
                    the Acquisition Agreement imposed an obligation on Man Financial to make a
                    general offer of employment to the defendant’s employees on terms of
                    remuneration and other benefits that were comparable to the same enjoyed by such
                    employees prior to the closing. The apprehension which the defendant’s
                    employees were feeling could have been dealt with to some extent at least by
                    publicising this obligation on the part of the purchaser. The plaintiff in fact
                    did this and he himself testified as to the steps he had taken to get Man (S) to
                    reassure the staff of the defendant regarding bonus payments if they remained in
                    Man (S)’s employ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Apart from the plaintiff’s own efforts,
                    the evidence showed that Man (S) had, prior to the passing of the December
                    Resolution, assured the defendant’s employees that it would honour its
                    obligations under sections 8.17(a) and (b) of the Acquisition Agreement. On
                    28 November 2005, Man (S) sent an e-mail to all the defendant’s
                    employees stating that Man Financial wanted to put their minds at rest over the
                    issue of bonuses and assured them that it would honour “all applicable
                    bonus entitlements in the normal course at the relevant time of year”. I
                    note that, in the event, this promise was kept in the case of all employees who
                    remained with Man (S) after the end of the 2006 financial year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As for the plaintiff’s feelings
                    regarding the duties of the defendant’s management, those were irrelevant
                    to a consideration of whether bonus payment would be in the defendant’s
                    best interests. The final point regarding the legal opinion of RT is something
                    that I will consider below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s contractual entitlement to bonus</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I will first set out the plaintiff’s
                    case on this issue. It was common ground that the plaintiff did not have a
                    written employment contract with the defendant. His pleaded case was that the
                    defendant’s employees, himself included, were entitled to bonus payments
                    by reason of “the Defendant’s policy, practice and/or
                    conduct” and that this was an “express and/or implied term of the
                    employment contracts of the Defendant’s employees, including the
                    Plaintiff”. He therefore relied on evidence of the practice of the
                    defendant as represented by its bonus payments over the years and by various
                    correspondence and memoranda to show that it was a term of his contract that he
                    was entitled to be paid bonuses on the basis of a profit sharing policy which
                    was always part of his employment contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The plaintiff stated that the remuneration
                    policy of the defendant was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant’s remuneration
                        policy was based on the principle of revenue and profit
                    sharing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The policy
                        was fine-tuned from one based purely on commission payouts to one where
                        commission payouts were combined with low base salaries;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even under the
                        old remuneration policy based on commission payouts, the employees of the
                        defendant had an in-principle entitlement to the total commission payouts
                        but it was the management (represented by the plaintiff) who had the
                        discretion to decide how to allocate the total commission payable among the
                        various employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In 1996, the defendant adopted a bonus formula
                    (“the Bonus Formula”) based on 30% of pre-tax profits adjusted for
                    cost of capital. The Bonus Formula was announced to all employees of the
                    defendant in a memorandum dated 23 January 1996 issued by the plaintiff. This
                    memorandum stated, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>

                    treasury, and Ms Tan Hwee Chin (“Ms Tan”), its finance
                    manager, that bonus based on the Bonus Formula accrued in the accounts of the
                    defendant on a monthly basis. He noted that Mr Winterbottom had agreed that
                    an accrual would mean that the company treated the item as a legal obligation.
                    Ms Tan had also confirmed that in the defendant’s quarterly filings
                    with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the monthly filings with the
                    Singapore Exchange, the bonuses were treated as liabilities and declared as
                    such. Ms Tan stated too that during her employment with the defendant, the
                    bonus declared by the company was consistent with the bonus policy told to her
                    by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiff said that his right to share in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff emphasised that the table showed
                    that bonus payments formed a significant component of his remuneration. The
                    bonus component went up to a high of 82.8% in 2005 including the bonus paid for
                    the defendant’s financial year ended 28 February 2005, because the
                    defendant was particularly profitable in that year. The plaintiff argued that
                    the table made it apparent that bonus had to be an integral part of his annual
                    remuneration as excluding bonus would render such remuneration to be not
                    commensurate with his position and responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiff also called various former
                    employees of the defendant to testify in relation to the plaintiff’s case
                    on the contractual entitlement to bonus. Among these were Mr Jeremy Ang who
                    had been employed by the defendant from 1984 to 2005 ending up as head of
                    commodity derivatives and also executive vice president. He stated that while he
                    worked with the defendant, it had always paid bonus on the principle of revenue
                    and profit sharing. In the mid 1990s, the Bonus Formula was introduced. Of the
                    30% of the profits allocated to bonus, 20% was allocated to the front office
                    while ten percent was allocated to the back office. The Bonus Formula was a
                    minimum formula and the defendant had, on numerous occasions, paid its employees
                    bonuses which exceeded the allocated sum based on the 30% formula. All employees
                    of the defendant had an expectation that bonus would be paid and bonus was in
                    fact paid every year except for 2005 when the defendant was taken over by Man
                    (S).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Ms Sheila Krishnan, head of audit and
                    compliance, who worked for the defendant from 2001 to 2006 testified that the
                    defendant’s remuneration policy was based on the principle of profit
                    sharing which was a characteristic of the broking business. During her
                    employment, she received bonus payments in April or May each year after the end
                    of the defendant’s previous financial year in February. Her understanding
                    of the defendant’s remuneration policy was that the employees were
                    entitled to bonus payments so long as the company made profits for that year but
                    the quantum of the bonus paid was dependent on the performance of the individual
                    employee and his/her department. Ms Ang Yang Noi Judy, the human resource
                    manager of the defendant from 1987 to 2005, gave evidence as to how the bonus
                    was arrived at. The amount of bonus payable to each employee would be decided by
                    the plaintiff in consultation with the department heads using a bonus worksheet
                    prepared by Ms Ang. When the bonus payment had been finalised, she would
                    prepare two documents: the bonus listings and the bonus summary sheet setting
                    out the proposed bonus payable to each employee. These documents were then sent
                    to Mr Bennett.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The plaintiff also considered it significant
                    that various officers of Man Financial had in November and December 2005
                    informed the defendant’s staff that Man Financial would honour applicable
                    bonus entitlements. For example, Mr Daniel Yeo, managing director of Man
                    Financial, had informed the defendant’s ex-employees on 8 December
                    2005 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any <em>applicable bonus entitlements</em> that would
                        have been due to you at the relevant time after Refco’s year end if
                        you had remained an employee of Refco will be computed using the same
                        methodology as used by Refco in previous years and payable in April 2006 in
                        accordance with the normal course of your employment with Refco.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Plaintiff’s emphasis]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ms Ang, who stayed on after the takeover, confirmed that she was
                    paid bonus in April 2006 by Man (S) as were other ex-employees of the defendant
                    who continued to be employed by Man (S). The bonus that was paid by Man (S) was
                    the same amount as per the bonus summary sheet and bonus listing for the seven
                    months ending 2005 which Ms Ang had prepared on the plaintiff’s
                    instructions while still working for the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff submitted that the actions of
                    Man Financial and Man (S) showed that they recognised the bonus entitlements of
                    the defendant’s employees and the defendant’s obligation to pay such
                    bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The defendant’s position was that there
                    was no contractual entitlement to bonus because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     Where written employment contracts
                        were issued by the defendant, those contracts stated expressly that bonuses
                        were discretionary;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     From 1 April 2005, the terms of the defendant’s Employee
                        Policy and Practice Manual (“the Manual”) were incorporated as
                        part of the defendant’s employees’ terms of employment and the
                        Manual stated that the defendant’s wage policy regarding bonuses was
                        that they were discretionary. The defendant cited the following passage from
                        the Manual:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Refco pays employees on the basis of the market value for the job
                            based on the employee’s qualifications, experience and expected
                            performance. In addition, employees receive annual discretionary bonus
                            and/or profit sharing bonuses determined on the basis of the performance
                            of the employee and his/her business unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     Contrary to the
                        plaintiff’s position that the defendant’s employees had a
                        contractual entitlement to a guaranteed bonus on the basis of the
                        defendant’s previous “policy, practice and/or conduct”,
                        the actual policy, practice and conduct of the defendant showed that bonuses
                        had been paid on a discretionary basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff was not able to establish an
                    express contractual entitlement to bonus. The documentation produced showed that
                    the defendant did not want to be tied down on bonus entitlements. In fact, the
                    defendant was able to show that in many instances, it had employed personnel on
                    the basis that bonus payments were discretionary. The plaintiff himself had
                    signed off on letters of appointment that stated expressly that bonus payments
                    would be discretionary. For example, on 20 April 2001, the defendant issued
                    a letter of appointment to one Ms Chan Hien Leng Dorothy and in that letter
                    it was specifically provided that “[d]epending on the company’s
                    performance, any bonus payment will be at the discretion of the company”.
                    Another letter of appointment, this one issued on 29 October 2003 to
                    Mr Chua Chiam Siang Jordan, stated that he would be able to participate in
                    “any discretionary bonus” arrangement that may thereafter be in
                    force. Both these letters were signed by the plaintiff. The express terms of the
                    letters showed that when it came to bonus entitlements, the defendant was not
                    willing to confer such entitlements in black and white. As the managing director
                    of the defendant, the plaintiff was careful to ensure that the letters of
                    appointment did not contradict the defendant’s intentions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Manual was consistent with the policy
                    disclosed in the letters of appointment referred to above. As cited above at
                        <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>, it referred expressly to the
                    “annual discretionary bonus”. Although the Manual was introduced
                    only in April 2005, it formed part of the conditions under which all employees
                    (including the plaintiff) were employed by the defendant. Indeed, it is clearly
                    stated in the Foreword to the Manual that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All employees will be required to adopt and adhere to the contents of the
                        manual as company policy. You will sign off and acknowledge on a separate
                        acknowledgement letter as having read, understood and agreeing to abide by
                        the contents of the manual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff was obviously aware of the contents of the Manual
                    although in court he tried to play down his understanding of the
                same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The documentary evidence in the form of the
                    Manual and the letters of appointment being so clearly against the express
                    provision of contractual bonus, it is not surprising that the plaintiff’s
                    submissions on this issue concentrated on establishing that the “policy,
                    practice and/or conduct” of the defendant was completely contrary to what
                    had been written and established a contractual entitlement that the documents
                    sought (ineffectually, from the plaintiff’s viewpoint) to deny. There are,
                    however, a number of difficulties in relation to the argument that the
                    defendant’s policy, practice and/or conduct was that the employees enjoyed
                    a contractual entitlement to bonus payments according to the Bonus
                    Formula.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The witnesses called by the plaintiff
                    supported his position that the defendant had shared its profits with its
                    employees through its Bonus Formula. As the defendant pointed out, however, the
                    principle of an employer’s sharing of profits with its employees does not,
                    in itself, lead to the conclusion that these employees are contractually
                    entitled to these payments. An employer can exercise its discretion annually to
                    pay out good bonuses in a competitive industry year after year, but that does
                    not transform such payments into a contractual entitlement, whether as to the
                    granting of the bonuses or the quantum. The plaintiff’s own actions in
                    sending out letters of appointment to new employees which specifically indicated
                    the discretionary nature of the bonus payments must indicate his own awareness
                    that a practice cannot be so easily transformed into a contractual
                    entitlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The heart of the plaintiff’s case on the
                    contractual entitlement basis is that there was an agreed formula, the Bonus
                    Formula, which governed the bonus payouts. He pleaded that by a fax dated
                    26 December 1995 he had proposed the Bonus Formula to Mr Bennett and
                    by his reply of 4 January 1996, Mr Bennett had agreed to the same.
                    However, the language of the 4 January 1996 letter indicates that
                    Mr Bennett’s agreement to the use of the Bonus Formula was only for
                    the financial year ended 1996. Mr Bennett said, <em>inter
                        alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for your telephone call today. In confirmation of our
                        discussions you may proceed to pay an additional S$255,000 in respect of the
                        bonus pool for the year ending February 28, 1995.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>As far as the current year arrangements are
                            concerned</em>, we agree that the bonus pool shall equal 30% of
                        adjusted pre-tax profits. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the evidence it could also be gathered that rather than the bonus
                    each year being determined by the Bonus Formula, it was determined by
                    Mr Bennett. The first example is that given above. In addition to what he
                    said in January 1996, on 17 April 1996, in relation to the same bonus,
                    Mr Bennett stated that “we [meaning the shareholders] retain the
                    right to adjust this formula (and reduce the pool)” and also said that
                    nothing could be confirmed unless “we have formally agreed on the numbers
                    and advised this to you”. The plaintiff himself cited another example of
                    Mr Bennett’s overriding discretion in relation to the bonuses paid
                    out for the financial year ended February 2005. In November 2004,
                    Mr Bennett had written to him and asked that the bonus payable to the Forex
                    department be reduced and in the event the bonus paid to that department was
                    reduced from 30% to 20%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The evidence also showed that whilst there may
                    have been a policy to generally aim to pay out 30% of profits in bonus, this was
                    not cast in stone since the bonus payments sometimes varied. During the trial,
                    the plaintiff confirmed that the bonus paid by the defendant for the financial
                    years ended February 2004 and February 2005 was less than 30% of the
                    defendant’s adjusted pre-tax profits. In the case of the financial year
                    ended February 2004, the bonus paid out was 28.98% of the profits whilst the
                    following year, bonus amounted to 24.08% of the profits. It would therefore
                    appear that the Bonus Formula was a guideline by which provisions were made by
                    the defendant for bonus payments at the end of its financial year, should it
                    exercise its discretion to make such payments. The defendant was financially
                    prudent in making such provisions but the act of doing so did not mandate
                    payment out of the entirety of the sums that had been provided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiff contended that bonus accrued
                    monthly because the defendant’s management accounts recorded bonus
                    provisions on a monthly basis. During cross-examination, however, the plaintiff
                    agreed that for the year ended February 2005, there was a variance between what
                    was provided for as bonus in the management accounts and what was eventually
                    paid out. It was put to him that the amounts which he said accrued on a monthly
                    basis as bonus payments to the defendant’s employees were not necessarily
                    what was paid out to them in total and he agreed. The fact that bonus did not
                    accrue monthly was also shown by the fact that bonus was always paid after the
                    end of the financial year and would not ordinarily be paid out to an employee
                    who left the defendant’s employment before the end of any financial year.
                    This was admitted by the plaintiff who conceded that payment of bonus to
                    employees who left during the financial year was only made on a case-by-case
                    basis and was a matter for him as managing director to decide in his
                    discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The evidence also showed that far from simply
                    determining what bonus was payable according to the Bonus Formula and paying
                    that sum out after the end of each financial year, the plaintiff invariably
                    sought Mr Bennett’s approval. At trial, the plaintiff admitted that
                    he sought such approval from Mr Bennett in the latter’s capacity as
                    the representative of Refco Inc. At the end of each financial year, the
                    plaintiff would write to Mr Bennett seeking his approval before the
                    specific bonus amounts were paid out. The plaintiff also admitted that over the
                    period from 1996 to 2005, he had consistently sought approval from the
                    defendant’s shareholders to pay bonus. If the plaintiff and the other
                    employees of the defendant had been contractually entitled to bonus, there would
                    have been no need to seek approval for payment of the same. This evidence also
                    established that the amount of bonus to be paid by the defendant had to be
                    approved, ultimately, by Mr Bennett; it was not fixed by the Bonus
                    Formula.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Regarding the submission that Man Financial
                    recognised the bonus entitlements of the defendant’s employees, the
                    evidence does not support the same. The language used by Man Financial to the
                    employees was “applicable bonus entitlements”. That was a neutral
                    phrase and did not indicate that Man Financial had agreed that there was a
                    contractual obligation to pay bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiff raised a further argument for me
                    to take into consideration if I was to find that the bonus payment was a
                    discretionary matter. He argued that even if such was the case, such discretion
                    had to be exercised in a reasonable manner and not capriciously, irrationally or
                    in bad faith. In support of this proposition, the plaintiff cited three first
                    instance English cases <em>viz</em>, <em>Clark v BET Plc Ltd and another</em> [1997] IRLR 348
                        (“<em>BET</em>”); <em>Clark v Nomura International plc</em> [2000] IRLR 766
                        (“<em>Nomura</em>”) and <em>Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald International</em>
                    [2003] IRLR 756 (“<em>Horkulak</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In <em>BET</em>, in the
                    context of a term which provided that the employee’s salary “shall
                    be reviewed annually and be increased by such amount if any as the board shall
                    in its absolute discretion decide”, the court held (at [10]) that this
                    created a contractual obligation to provide an annual upward adjustment in
                    salary and (at [11]) “if the board had capriciously or in bad faith
                    exercised its discretion so as to determine the increase at nil and therefore to
                    pay Mr Clark [the employee claimant] no increase at all, that would have
                    been a breach of contract”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>Nomura</em>, the
                    plaintiff was a senior equities trader who had been dismissed by the defendant
                    employer. The plaintiff claimed his bonus under a discretionary bonus scheme
                    which was based on individual performance. The plaintiff was not awarded any
                    bonus during the three-month notice period while other senior employees were
                    awarded substantial bonuses. The court held, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the employer was in breach of contract for not
                    awarding the plaintiff a discretionary bonus for the nine-month period prior to
                    his dismissal during which he had earned profits for the company,
                    notwithstanding that the contract provided for a discretionary scheme. The court
                    proceeded to hold (at [80]) that the employer’s decision to award a nil
                    bonus to an employee who had earned substantial profits for the company was
                    plainly perverse and irrational and did not comply with the terms of the
                    employer’s discretion. In <em>Horkulak</em>, the
                    perverse and irrational test was rejected and when considering whether an
                    employee who had been, in effect, wrongfully dismissed, was entitled to recover
                    a discretionary bonus, the court held that the right approach was that the
                    employer had to exercise its discretion reasonably and in good faith. In a
                    judgment that reversed the decision at first instance only in terms of quantum
                    of damages, <em>Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald
                        International</em> [2004] 1 RLR 942, the Court of Appeal
                    held (at [30]) that there would be an implied term that there should be genuine
                    and rational exercise of such discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     These three English cases show that the
                    English position is not yet settled since there is still a difference of opinion
                    as to the correct test to be applied. The English authorities do, however,
                    appear to be leaning in favour of regulating the way in which an employer
                    exercises his discretion in relation to the payment of bonus and against holding
                    that the discretion is an absolute one. The position in Singapore, however, is
                    not the same as the English one. In <em>Latham v Credit Suisse
                        First Boston</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30, the Court of Appeal
                    set out the principles that must guide me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In that case, the appellant, Latham, had
                    brought an action against the respondent company claiming, amongst other things,
                    that he was wrongfully dismissed and that the respondent owed him a guaranteed
                    bonus of almost US$2m. Latham’s case was premised primarily on the
                    argument that the company had promised him a guaranteed bonus during
                    negotiations prior to his employment. Latham’s appeal against the
                    dismissal of his claim was unsuccessful. On the facts, the Court of Appeal
                    considered that it was unlikely that the company’s representative had
                    promised him such a bonus. The Court of Appeal went on to discuss whether Latham
                    would have been entitled to a discretionary bonus if he had not been dismissed
                    from the company. The relevant clause of Latham’s employment contract
                    stated that “a bonus may be paid to you at the end of each calendar year,
                    based on Company profitability and your performance during the
                    year”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Court opined that in the circumstances a
                    bonus payment would be entirely discretionary. Even if Latham had continued to
                    be employed at the company, he would not have had a legal right to claim a bonus
                    from the company. At [71] – [72] the Court stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    In our view, it would be wrong to allow an employee
                            in Latham’s position to lay claim to a discretionary bonus on a
                            proper construction of his employment contract when his services were
                            terminated even before his bonus was properly declared. In both
                                <em>Walz v Barings Services Ltd</em>, a
                            preliminary hearing before the English Industrial Tribunal, and
                                <em>Bajor v Citibank International plc</em>
                            (Queen’s Bench Division, 19 February 1998, unreported), the
                            plaintiffs were employed in an industry in which the employees operated
                            within a ‘bonus culture’ in which bonuses were very commonly
                            and even invariably paid. However, both plaintiffs were held not to be
                            entitled to claim the bonus as a matter of contractual obligation after
                            being dismissed, even if they were wrongfully dismissed as in the case
                            of <em>Bajor v Citibank International plc</em>. In
                                <em>Walz v Barings Services Ltd</em>, this was
                            so even though the bonus had already been announced by the respondents.
                            It was held there that, as the bonus was totally discretionary, there
                            was simply no obligation to pay. Announcing it did not convert the
                            payment of the bonus into a contractual obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    Latham’s situation was akin to the plaintiffs
                            in these two cases. Unless the bonus had been expressed to be
                            guaranteed, an employee in Latham’s position could not claim to be
                            legally entitled to a bonus, the granting and quantum of which are
                            entirely at the discretion of the employer. While he might have hoped
                            for a bonus if he had indeed remained in the employ of CSFB, the fact
                            remained that, even then, he would not have been able to claim to be
                            entitled to a bonus as of right as it was entirely at the discretion of
                            CSFB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I find that the plaintiff had no contractual
                    right to bonus because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     his employment contract did not
                        contain any term guaranteeing bonus payments;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     the evidence did not support the
                        plaintiff’s assertion that the defendant’s policy, practice
                        and/or conduct was that bonuses were guaranteed and calculated based on the
                        Bonus Formula; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     the discretion vested in the defendant as to whether to pay bonus or
                        not was an absolute discretion not fettered in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The issue to be considered in relation to the
                    defendant’s counterclaim is whether the plaintiff was in breach of his
                    fiduciary duties and duties of fidelity and is therefore liable for the payments
                    made by the defendant under settlement agreements with its
                ex-employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The defendant’s case in this regard is
                    that there was no basis for the December Resolution to have been passed
                    as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant’s employees,
                        including the plaintiff, had no contractual entitlement to guaranteed bonus
                        payments;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        defendant’s shareholders had expressly instructed the plaintiff not to
                        make bonus payments;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Acquisition Agreement only allowed payment of bonuses in the
                        ordinary course of business;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_d"></a>(d)     there was no evidence of any risk that the
                        defendant’s employees would not transfer over to Man (S) on the
                        closing date; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_e"></a>(e)     the legal opinion relied upon by the plaintiff was premised on
                        insufficient facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first four of the above points
                    have already been discussed and I have found that they have been
                    established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I now turn to the legal opinion which was
                    issued by RT. The plaintiff sought to rely on this to justify the declaration of
                    bonuses pursuant to the December Resolution. This legal opinion was given on the
                    basis of instructions which Ms Sheila Krishnan gave to RT. In so doing,
                    Ms Krishnan relied on facts conveyed to her by the plaintiff. In her
                    testimony, Ms Krishnan confirmed that RT had not been advised that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     the bonus provision in the
                        management accounts was not always the same as the amounts eventually paid
                        out at the end of the financial year; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     the defendant’s shareholder’s
                        approval was always sought before bonus was declared at the end of the
                        financial year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above facts were critical to the
                    formation of an opinion on whether the bonus was contractual or discretionary.
                    As RT did not have a chance to consider the impact of these facts on the legal
                    position regarding bonus, its opinion was based on insufficient facts and could
                    not be used to justify the passing of the December Resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The opinion was dated 18 November 2005. A
                    few days later, on 25 November 2005, RT wrote to the plaintiff and gave him
                    further advice as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The plaintiff] should be reminded that while it is <em>arguable</em> (on the basis of the reasoning set out) that the
                        employees are entitled to bonus, <em>the actual quantum may
                            still be discretionary</em>, although it is also arguable that
                        that discretion needs to be exercised reasonably and in accordance with
                        agreed bonus payment criteria (if any). To the extent that such criteria
                            <em>(sic)</em> exists and <em>is
                            known and agreed by all parties (particularly if it forms part of their
                            respective employment contracts)</em> I believe that the case for
                        bonus entitlement and scope of entitlement (i.e. quantum) will be
                        strengthened. However to the extent that the bonus payments are patently
                        higher than normal or higher than need be, then the good faith of [the
                        plaintiff] and the board will be called into question jeopardising the
                        entirety of any decision to give and pay out bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So long as the company is solvent and will not be rendered insolvent by
                        the payment of bonuses, <em>the only party capable of
                            complaint is the shareholders, and then only if they can show that the
                            board and [the plaintiff] acted contrary to their fiduciary duties as
                            directors. Reasonableness and good faith are critical</em>. If
                        there is doubt as to whether a higher or lower sum should be paid [to] an
                        employee, prudence and law dictates payment of the lower sum in the exercise
                        of the discretion as to quantum determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     From the above, it can be seen that RT were
                    qualifying their original opinion and indicating that it was arguable that the
                    bonus payment was an entitlement. They were also saying that discretion to
                    determine the quantum of bonus had to be exercised reasonably and the board had
                    to act in accordance with its fiduciary duties in making the payments and the
                    determination of quantum. The board therefore had to act in good faith as
                    regards any decision to make interim bonus payments. RT had indicated that the
                    case for an entitlement to bonus would be strengthened to the extent that fixed
                    criteria for the determination of bonuses existed and were known and agreed to
                    by all the parties. The lawyers were not informed that there were no fixed
                    criteria.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In all the circumstances of the case, bearing
                    in mind the basis on which the opinion of 18 November 2005 was issued and
                    the qualification which followed on 25 November 2005, I agree with the
                    defendant’s submission that the plaintiff was not entitled to rely on the
                    legal opinion to justify his decision to proceed to pass the December
                    Resolution. As I have found, the plaintiff knew that there was no contractual
                    entitlement to bonus much less an entitlement to a bonus payment before the end
                    of the financial year, no matter how novel the circumstances. In this situation,
                    it was against the defendant’s interests for the plaintiff to pass a
                    resolution which conferred bonus entitlements that did not exist otherwise on
                    the defendant’s staff. The defendant thus became liable to make payments
                    which it would not otherwise have had to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I conclude that the plaintiff was in breach of
                    his fiduciary duties when he procured the passing of the December Resolution. I
                    note that the other director, Mr Keith Tay, testified that he was not
                    informed of Mr Dangremond’s e-mail instruction of 23 November
                    2005 to the plaintiff that he was not to make any bonus payments. Instead the
                    plaintiff had only shown him the plaintiff’s own e-mail of
                    28 November 2005 which stated that he had not received a substantive
                    response to his earlier letter to Mr Dangremond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As a result of the passing of the December
                    Resolution, the defendant became liable to claims for bonus from various
                    employees. To date, it has paid out $769,900.80 to these employees. The
                    defendant says that it has also incurred other expenses as a result of these
                    claims. It is entitled to be indemnified by the plaintiff against all loss
                    proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For the reasons given above, I dismiss the
                    plaintiff’s claim and give judgment to the defendant on its counterclaim
                    for damages to be assessed. The plaintiff shall bear the defendant’s costs
                    of the claim and counterclaim.</p>
