</div> Shipoil and Island Oil did not explain why they did not attend the hearing of SUM 3316. Neither did they challenge the fact that DDW’s claim had priority over their respective claims. Instead, they made the following arguments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If DDW enforced the Nautical Judgment Debt first and obtained full payment under the Gard LOU and/or from the defendant, the shortfall on DDW’s claim under the ADM 51 Judgment would be US$500,000. If this shortfall was then satisfied from the Balance Sale Proceeds, there would remain approximately US$5.3m from the Balance Sale Proceeds that would be available for distribution to other creditors.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the contrary, if the whole of the Balance Sale Proceeds were paid to DDW:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the other creditors would receive nothing; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) if DDW then enforced the Nautical Judgment Debt and recovered the full amount of the Nautical Judgment Debt, DDW would be overpaid by US$5.3m, which the creditors would not benefit from because DDW would have to return the excess amount to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On the basis of the above arguments, Shipoil and Island Oil sought:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) to set aside my order made on 9 November 2022 and to adjourn SUM 3316 <span class="font-italic">sine die</span> pending the outcome of enforcement proceedings by DDW against the Nautical Judgment Debt and/or the Gard LOU; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) alternatively, to vary my order made on 9 November 2022 to fix the amount to be paid out to DDW at US$500,000 with liberty to DDW to apply in relation to the balance of DDW’s claim after DDW had exhausted its enforcement proceedings against the Nautical Judgment Debt and/or the Gard LOU.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 DDW submitted that the request for further arguments should not be allowed because there was no dispute that DDW’s mortgage claim ranked in priority, and it could elect whether to enforce its claim against the Balance Sale Proceeds or the Gard LOU or the Nautical Judgment Debt.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I agreed with DDW and rejected the request for further arguments by Shipoil and Island Oil. Their case was tantamount to compelling DDW to attempt to satisfy the ADM 51 Judgment (at least in part) by enforcing the Nautical Judgment Debt and/or the Gard LOU first instead of satisfying the ADM 51 Judgment by way of its mortgagee claim against the Balance Sale Proceeds. Shipoil and Island Oil did not produce any authorities that showed that they were entitled to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The ADM 51 Judgment was for sums owing to DDW under the DPA. As stated earlier, the defendant’s obligations to DDW under the DPA were secured by the Mortgage and the assignments of the Gard LOU and the Nautical Judgment Debt. I agreed with DDW that as a matter of law, it was entitled to elect to enforce its remedies as far as applicable, subject to there being no double recovery: <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Myrto”</span> [1977] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 243 at 258. DDW was entitled to look to any security that had been provided by the defendant, including the Mortgage, to satisfy the ADM 51 Judgment. The Vessel had been sold and the Balance Sale Proceeds represented the value of the Vessel. DDW chose, as it was entitled to, to enforce its mortgagee claim against the Balance Sale Proceeds. Shipoil and Island Oil had no basis in law to object to DDW doing so, or to require DDW to first enforce its remedies under the assignment of the Gard LOU or the assignment of the Nautical Judgment Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 There were also practical reasons for DDW to seek payment from the Balance Sale Proceeds. DDW’s claim to the Nautical Judgment Debt was subject to interpleader proceedings in England. Clyde had challenged DDW’s entitlement to priority over the Nautical Judgment Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It appeared that on 22 November 2022, a consent order was entered staying the interpleader proceedings in England. DDW did not explain the reason for the stay. Shipoil and Island Oil submitted that a reasonable inference was that the interpleader proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of DDW’s application for payment out of the Balance Sale Proceeds. In my view, whether or not this was so, was irrelevant. DDW was fully entitled to seek payment from the Balance Sale Proceeds first.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I also agreed with DDW that there was no risk of double recovery. As DDW expressly stated on affidavit, it would first seek payment from the Balance Sale Proceeds and thereafter look towards the Nautical Judgment Debt for recovery of its remaining debt under the ADM 51 Judgment.

</div> In any event, the assignments of the Gard LOU and the Nautical Judgment Debt were as security for the defendant’s obligations under the DPA. Any payment received by DDW from the Balance Sale Proceeds would reduce the defendant’s obligations under the ADM 51 Judgment. Consequently, DDW’s right to payment under the assignments of the Gard LOU and the Nautical Judgment Debt would be reduced accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Payment of the Balance Sale Proceeds to DDW meant that Shipoil and Island Oil were left to pursue their respective claims against the defendant. Obviously, Shipoil and Island Oil wanted DDW to first satisfy the ADM 51 Judgment by enforcing the Nautical Judgment Debt and/or the Gard LOU as it would be more convenient for them to enforce their claims against the Balance Sale Proceeds. However, DDW was free to satisfy the ADM 51 Judgment from the Balance Sale Proceeds first and DDW had no obligation to choose a course of action that better suited Shipoil and Island Oil. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 For the above reasons, I rejected the request for further arguments and affirmed my decision in SUM 3316 given on 9 November 2022. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Bazul Ashhab Bin Abdul Kader, Prakaash s/o Paniar Silvam and Ng Guang Yi (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the fifth intervener;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Wee Kong and Poh Ying Ying Joanna (JLex LLC) for the sixth and seventh interveners;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Zhi Ming Max (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the second and eighth interveners;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Yuhui (Incisive Law LLC) for the fourth intervener;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Subashini d/o Narayanasamy (Haridass Ho &amp; Partners) for the ninth intervener;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sylvia Lem Jia Li (Clasis LLC) for the tenth intervener;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The plaintiffs, the first and third intervener absent;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The defendant absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
