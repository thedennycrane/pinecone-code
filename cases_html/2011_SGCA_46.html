<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Mohammad Ashik bin Aris
                    (“the appellant”) against the decision of the trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) in Criminal Case No 25 of 2010 (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Ashik bin Aris</em> [2011] SGHC
                    111 (“the GD”)) convicting him of one charge of consumption of
                    methamphetamine, an offence under s 8(<em>b</em>)(ii)
                    of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the
                    MDA”). At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed the appeal. We now
                    give our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The background facts are set out at [2]–[5] of the GD. To provide a brief summary, on 22 January
                    2010, the appellant was arrested while he was in possession of a pipe (which
                    subsequent scientific analysis found to be stained with methamphetamine), 18
                    packets of crystalline white substance and several empty packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After the appellant was taken to the Bedok
                    Police Headquarters (“BPHQ”), three samples of urine
                    (collectively, “the Urine Samples”) were taken from him. The first
                    sample tested positive for methamphetamine in an Instant Urine Test done at the
                    BPHQ. The second and third samples (“the Second and Third
                    Samples”) were sent for testing by the Health Sciences Authority
                    (“HSA”). The tests on those two samples revealed the presence of
                    methamphetamine, and certificates under s 16 of the MDA (“s 16
                    certificates”) were issued to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On the day of his arrest, the appellant also
                    made three incriminating statements which stated the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     earlier that morning, he had bought
                        2.4g of “Ice” (a well-known street name for methamphetamine)
                        from one “Kopi Kia” and had repacked the “Ice”
                        into 24 packets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     he had consumed six of the 24 packets, with the remaining 18 packets
                        intended for resale to his former colleagues at a price of $50 per
                        packet;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     he had
                        bought “Ice” from “Kopi Kia” on five to six
                        previous occasions, both for his own consumption and for resale;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     he was a heavy
                        “Ice” smoker who consumed five to six packets every
                        day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before we provide a summary of the Judge’s
                    decision and the arguments of the parties in this appeal, it is convenient that
                    we first set out the relevant statutory provisions in the MDA, <em>ie</em>, ss 8(<em>b</em>), 16, 22,
                    31(1) and 31(4). They are as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Judge decided that, on the facts, the
                    Prosecution had proved the charge against the appellant in the following three
                    ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellant had voluntarily
                        confessed that he had consumed what he believed to be “Ice”.
                        In relation to the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence
                        charged, the Judge stated that the only dispute was as to the precise
                        identity of the substance which was in fact consumed by the appellant. He
                        found that this element was proved because the appellant had sufficient
                        knowledge of, and familiarity with, methamphetamine for his belief that he
                        was consuming methamphetamine to be true.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant had failed to rebut the presumption
                        in s 22 of the MDA (“the s 22 presumption”) that he
                        had consumed methamphetamine, which presumption was triggered by the fact
                        that methamphetamine had been found in his urine by the tests conducted by
                        the HSA on the Second and Third Samples. The Judge held, on the evidence,
                        that the HSA had complied fully with the requirements of
                            s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA (referred to
                        hereafter as “s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)”
                        for short), thereby triggering the s 22 presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge held that the presumption in
                        s 16 of the MDA (“the s 16 presumption”) had also
                        been triggered by the issue of the s 16 certificates by the HSA even if
                            s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) had not been complied
                        with. The appellant had failed to prove the contrary of the matters stated
                        in the s 16 certificates issued. The Judge also rejected the
                        appellant’s argument that all the methamphetamine detected was due to
                        contamination of the Second and Third Samples prior to the urine
                        tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first (and also the main) issue in this
                    appeal was whether the urine-testing procedures of the HSA at the material time
                    complied with the requirements of s 31(4)(<em>b</em>).
                    It was not disputed that because of and since the decision of the High Court in
                        <em>Lim Boon Keong v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010]
                    4 SLR 451 (“<em>Lim Boon Keong</em>”),
                    the HSA had, <em>ex abundanti cautela</em>, changed its
                    urine-testing procedures (effective from 30 June 2010) in order to comply
                    with the observations of the court as to the legality or propriety of those
                    procedures. Although this appeal was concerned only with the pre-30 June
                    2010 urine-testing procedures, which were the procedures used in the analysis of
                    the Second and Third Samples, the Prosecution’s position in this appeal
                    was that those procedures were in full compliance with the requirements of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), and it invited this court to
                    make a ruling to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The second issue in this appeal concerned the
                    relationship between ss 16, 22 and 31(4)(<em>b</em>),
                    and, in particular, whether non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) would <em>ipso facto</em> lead to the
                    rebuttal of the s 16 presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The third issue concerned other ways in which
                    the Prosecution could prove consumption apart from relying on the statutory
                    presumptions in the MDA, and, in particular, whether, in principle, confessions
                    were in themselves sufficient to establish the <em>actus
                        reus</em> of the offence under s 8(<em>b</em>) of the MDA (“the s 8(<em>b</em>) offence”) beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: Compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The significance of compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) is that if there are positive
                    results from both of the urine tests carried out pursuant to this subsection,
                    the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has,
                    in contravention of s 8(<em>b</em>), consumed the
                    controlled drug detected in his urine samples. This means that both the
                        <em>actus reus</em> and the <em>mens
                        rea</em> of the s 8(<em>b</em>) offence are
                    presumed by s 22: see <em>Vadugaiah Mahendran v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 719 at [24] (see only the first three sentences); and
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Loon Lui</em> [2003]
                    2 SLR(R) 216 at [6]. In
                    examining whether the HSA’s urine-testing procedures at the material time
                    complied with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), we considered three
                    specific questions, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     when a urine test
                    begins;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     what the
                        stipulation in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) that a urine
                        test must be “conducted … by” (in the context of the
                        present appeal) an analyst employed by the HSA (an “analyst”)
                        entails; and</p>

                        each of the urine tests mentioned therein must be conducted “by a
                        different person” entails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The analysis of urine by the HSA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     For present purposes, it is necessary to
                    outline briefly the steps involved in the urine-testing procedures of the HSA
                    which were in issue. The Judge has helpfully conducted a detailed exposition of
                    the entire process: see [77]–[180] and Annex A of the GD. Typically,
                    a screening test is first conducted on one of the two parts of the urine sample
                    mentioned in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) from an accused
                    person by an “auto-analyser” (the accuracy of which was not
                    challenged in the present appeal). The screening test is a preliminary test to
                    detect the presence of controlled drugs. It was introduced by the HSA to reduce
                    the number of urine samples sent for the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
                    (“GC/MS”) test. If the screening test produces a negative result,
                    the HSA’s practice is not to proceed with further testing, but the
                    statutory provisions do not prohibit it from carrying out the GC/MS test on the
                    two parts of the urine sample concerned. If no further testing is done, the
                    consequence will be that the charge against the accused person may have to be
                    withdrawn if there is no other evidence of consumption against
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     If the screening test shows a positive result,
                    the two parts of the urine sample mentioned in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) are then sent for the GC/MS test. To prepare each part of the
                    urine sample for this test, a process involving sampling, solid phase extraction
                    (“SPE”) and derivatisation is carried out, where the urine is
                    subjected to physical manipulation and chemical reactions. Various chemical
                    compounds are also added.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Once the sampling, SPE and derivatisation
                    stage is completed, the glass vial containing the first part of the urine sample
                    from the accused person is placed on a tray. This tray also contains other vials
                    with liquids whose identities and components are known, such as quality control
                    samples with specific types and amounts of controlled drugs. The GC/MS
                    instrument then carries out the GC/MS test on all the vials. This test is
                    automated, and is done according to the sequence and parameters programmed into
                    the instrument’s computer by a laboratory officer (“LO”)
                    before the start of the test. The glass vial containing the second part of the
                    urine sample from the accused person undergoes the same process, but in a
                    different workflow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     All the results generated by the GC/MS
                    instrument (known as “chromatograms”) for the first set of vials
                    (which includes, <em>inter alia</em>, the vial containing
                    the first part of the urine sample from the accused person) are handed over to
                    an analyst. Similarly, all the chromatograms for the second set of vials (which
                    includes, <em>inter alia</em>, the vial containing the
                    second part of the urine sample from the accused person) are handed over to a
                    different analyst. Each analyst then analyses and interprets the data for his
                    own set of chromatograms, reaches his conclusions for each part of the urine
                    sample in question and issues s 16 certificates based on those
                    conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     All the chromatograms, s 16 certificates
                    and other documents are then passed to a senior analyst who carries out a final
                    review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">When a urine test under s 31(4)(b) begins</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above, the first question we had to consider <em>vis-à-vis</em> the issue of compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) was when a urine test under
                    this subsection begins. In this connection, we note that the appellant took
                    issue before the Judge with the propriety or regularity of the urine collection
                    process at the BPHQ, which he contended was part of the urine test (see [242] of
                    the GD). This argument was not pursued on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The appellant argued that a urine test under
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) began at the screening stage
                    referred to at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above, and, therefore,
                    the Judge was wrong to find that it began only at the sampling, SPE and
                    derivatisation stage. Although the appellant conceded that, on the facts,
                    nothing had gone wrong <em>per se</em> at the screening
                    stage in his case, he argued that a finding on the issue of whether the
                    screening stage constituted part of a urine test was nonetheless important
                    because if the screening stage did indeed form part of a urine test, an analyst
                    must “conduct” this stage personally to comply with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We did not agree with the appellant’s
                    submission that a urine test under s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)
                    begins at the screening stage. We agreed with the Judge that it begins instead
                    at the sampling, SPE and derivatisation stage for the reasons set out at
                    [246]–[250] of the GD. The screening test has absolutely no impact on what
                    is reported in a s 16 certificate, except that a negative result at the
                    screening stage means that if the HSA does not proceed with further testing
                    (which will usually be the case, given the HSA’s practice (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above)), no s 16 certificate will be
                    issued at all. In such a case, a false negative result at the screening stage
                    can only be to an accused person’s benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Before we turn to the next question, we note
                    that although the Prosecution argued before the Judge that a urine test under
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) began at the GC/MS test proper
                    and thus did not include the sampling, SPE and derivatisation stage, it did not,
                    in this appeal, dispute the correctness of the Judge’s finding that the
                    latter (<em>ie</em>, the sampling, SPE and derivatisation
                    stage) formed part of a urine test. We agreed with the Judge’s findings on
                    this point at [251]–[254] of the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What the stipulation in s 31(4)(b) that a urine test must be
                “conducted … by” an analyst entails</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We move now to the question of what the
                    stipulation in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) that a urine test
                    must be “conducted … by” an analyst entails. The appellant
                    argued that in order for an analyst to have “conducted” a urine
                    test, the latter must have been continuously present throughout the entire
                    process of the test. This was required because Parliament intended that the
                    presence throughout the entire test process of an analyst, as a professional
                    scientist, would prevent any abuse or inadvertent mix-ups. In support of this
                    argument, the appellant referred to the following speeches in Parliament when
                    the second urine test was introduced in place of the previous one-test regime
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (9 November 1977) vol 37 at
                    cols 180–182):</p>

<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang)</b>:
                        Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like a clarification on the second urine
                        test. It is not unknown that even in medical laboratories and hospitals
                        where the staff are specially trained to conduct tests that there are cases
                        of mix-up. Here we have cases of people who are not specialised to take such
                        samples, and I think we would appreciate the Minister’s assurance that
                        very detailed methods of taking test samples would be laid down. Of course,
                        it is not possible to have a foolproof system but I think a detailed system
                        of taking test samples which would minimise the incidence of mix-up would be
                        appreciated.</p>

                        scientists. <em>We have scientists in the Department of
                            Scientific Services</em> [which was later incorporated into the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The appellant also pointed out that in <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (30 November 1989)
                    vol 54 at col 865, Prof S Jayakumar (the then Minister for
                    Home Affairs) stated, “Both samples will be tested by different chemists
                    with the necessary safeguards”. In reliance on these statements, the
                    appellant took issue with the HSA’s practice and procedure of not
                    requiring its analysts to be present at all during the entire urine-testing
                    process until the point when they were assigned the task of analysing and
                    interpreting the chromatograms, <em>ie</em>, until after
                    the GC/MS test had been completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was not clear to us precisely what
                        <em>degree</em> of presence (or involvement) by an
                    analyst was, in the appellant’s contention, necessary. Before the Judge,
                    the appellant argued that actual, continuous and real-time supervision was
                    required. This was a much higher degree of involvement than “mere”
                    presence in the laboratory, unless what the appellant had intended to suggest
                    was that the analyst was required to stand behind or near the LO when the latter
                    carried out the various steps in the urine-testing process. Even then, it was
                    not clear whether the appellant’s counsel was advocating that the ratio of
                    analysts to LOs should be 1:1, or 1:2, or lesser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We agreed with the Judge’s comprehensive
                    analysis and conclusion (at [258]–[264] of the GD) that the urine-testing
                    procedures used by the HSA at the material time fully complied with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) in the sense that a urine test
                    would be “conducted … by” an analyst if those procedures
                    were followed. In our view, the phrase “conducted … by” has
                    a spectrum of possible meanings and does not necessarily mean that the person
                    who “conducts” an activity has to personally carry out, or
                    personally supervise in real-time, each of the steps which constitute that
                    activity. One way of looking at the urine-testing process is that the role of
                    the analyst is like that of a conductor who conducts an orchestra. The conductor
                    does not have to play every single instrument well or at all, so long as he is
                    still able to retain overall control of the orchestral performance (see [199] of
                    the GD). As Scrutton LJ stated in <em>Council of the
                        Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Fuller</em> [1932]
                    96 JP 422 at 424:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view “conduct” means something very like
                        “control” or “manage,” so that a man may conduct
                        the business without personally undertaking or carrying out every item that
                        is done in the business. ... [T]he business may be conducted by a man who
                        does not himself perform every act which forms part of the business, it is
                        enough that he controls it, regulates it and has the power which he
                        exercises of giving orders as to how it shall be carried on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Within the spectrum of possible meanings of
                    the phrase “conducted … by” in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), the choice of which meaning to attribute to that
                    phrase must be guided by a purposive approach: see s 9A of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed). The legislative history of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) and the relevant Parliamentary
                    debates (see [216]–[227] of the GD, and also <em>Lim Boon
                        Keong</em> at [25]–[28])
                    indicate that the general thrust and tenor of the introduction of the second
                    urine test in 1977 and the subsequent amendment of the then equivalent of
                    s 22 of the MDA in 1989 was directed at reducing the possibility of human
                    error or abuse. In our view, there is no rational nexus between the
                    appellant’s proposition (<em>viz</em>, that an
                    analyst must be continuously present throughout the entire urine-testing
                    process) and this objective because most of the errors that may occur are not
                    detectable visually and, further, a Laboratory Manual is available for reference
                    in the HSA’s laboratory. For errors which can be detected visually, for
                    example, a mix-up of urine samples due to an erroneous reading of the labels on
                    the bottles containing the samples, such errors may be detected with at least
                    equal efficacy by anyone competent in reading and who has an eye for detail as
                    by an analyst. It would thus be unduly onerous and unreasonable to read the
                    words “conducted … by” in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) as imposing a requirement that an analyst must carry out all
                    the steps in the urine-testing process, or at least supervise these steps, in
                    order to avoid this particular type of errors (<em>ie</em>,
                    errors which can be detected visually).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In short, we agreed with the Judge that an
                    analyst is not required by s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) to be
                    present in the laboratory throughout, or to physically supervise in real-time,
                    all the various steps involved in a urine test. All that is necessary is that
                    the analyst should have regard to all the chromatograms generated from the set
                    of vials assigned to him (containing, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    one part of the urine sample mentioned in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) and quality control samples) before arriving at his
                    conclusions. In so doing, the analyst would be able to detect any errors in the
                    steps which are part of the urine test, including the steps carried out at the
                    sampling, SPE and derivatisation stage. We accept that there is a rational nexus
                    between a requirement for an analyst to conduct real-time supervision of that
                    stage (<em>ie</em>, the sampling, SPE and derivatisation
                    stage) and the objective of the 1977 and 1989 amendments, because that stage
                    involves the physical and chemical manipulation of the accused person’s
                    actual urine sample with scientific instruments. However, in our view, to read
                    such a requirement into s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) would be
                    to place an unnecessarily onerous burden on the HSA in achieving the purpose of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) because the analyst would then
                    be required to both supervise the sampling, SPE and derivatisation stage
                        <em>and</em> analyse all the chromatograms in the light
                    of the fact that most of the possible errors which may occur are not detectable
                    visually. The risk of human error due to fatigue or inertia would
                    correspondingly increase, particularly due to the large number of urine samples
                    that have to be analysed by the HSA daily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We were of the opinion that: (a) the
                    division of labour in the HSA’s laboratory at the material time was an
                    efficient arrangement which nonetheless provided a sufficient safeguard that the
                    steps which required a higher level of expertise (<em>ie</em>, the interpretation and analysis of all the chromatograms)
                    would be carried out by personnel with the appropriate qualifications and
                    training; and (b) those steps provided a meaningful and effective means of
                    supervising the urine tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We did not think that the reference to the
                    Parliamentary debates (at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above)
                    provided any assistance to the appellant because they merely contemplated that
                    urine tests would be “carried out” or “done” by
                    scientists. Those debates did not specify <em>how</em>
                    urine tests were to be carried out. The answer to this question naturally
                    changes over time with advances in science and technology. We were satisfied,
                    based on the HSA’s urine-testing procedures at the material time and in
                    the light of the Judge’s thorough analysis, that the HSA’s analysts
                    have sufficient supervision of the entire urine test such that they are able to
                    claim responsibility for it and for the conclusions stated in the s 16
                    certificates that they issue: see <em>Lim Boon Keong</em>
                    at [39] (see only the second last
                    sentence).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There is another equally good reason for
                    adopting a purposive reading of s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) to
                    achieve this result. The relevant offence (<em>viz</em>,
                    the s 8(<em>b</em>) offence) is that of consuming a
                    controlled or specified drug (referred to hereafter as “a specified
                    drug”
                    <em>per se</em> for convenience): the quantity or weight of
                    the specified drug in question is not relevant to the commission of the offence.
                    The urine tests under s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) are
                    conducted to determine the presence of specified drugs in an accused
                    person’s urine sample, and not to determine their concentration or their
                    weight. The introduction of the second urine test in 1977 was intended to detect
                    any errors due to a contamination or a mix-up of urine samples. Once urine
                    samples are properly obtained from an accused person, errors in the detection of
                    the existence of a specified drug in those samples can only occur due to a
                    mix-up or contamination of the samples, and not due to the urine test itself
                    because it is performed automatically by specially-designed equipment.
                    Furthermore, the urine from an accused person is tested three times: once by the
                    relevant enforcement agency and twice by the HSA. Hence, the need for an analyst
                    to personally carry out or supervise all the steps involved in a urine test is
                    not justified by the purpose of the test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     During the hearing of this appeal, we observed
                    that although s 31(4) provides that the three parts of an accused
                    person’s urine sample “shall be ... dealt with, in such manner and
                    in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed”, there is no
                    prescribed procedure, whether in the MDA or the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens
                    and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Regulations”), for dealing with that part of the urine
                    sample which is subjected to the preliminary urine test mentioned in
                        s 31(4)(<em>a</em>). Equally, the relevance and
                    the admissibility of the results of this preliminary urine test are not provided
                    for. Presumably, this omission is due to the fact that the preliminary urine
                    test is done to sieve out cases with negative results, and therefore has no
                    adverse consequences for the accused person, whatever its result might be.
                    However, this irregularity should, in our view, be rectified by a prescriptive
                    measure as required by s 31(4) itself. In any event, s 31(4) should
                    also make clear whether or not, in the event that the preliminary urine test on
                    one part of an accused person’s urine sample produces a negative result,
                    the Central Narcotics Bureau (or other relevant enforcement agency) has the
                    discretion to send the remaining two parts of the urine sample to the HSA for
                    further analysis in the interest of good governance and to accord with the
                    Minister for Home Affairs’ statement in 2006 that the amendments to the
                    MDA (including the provision for the preliminary urine test) were “to
                    enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the CNB [Central
                    Narcotics Bureau]”: see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (16 January 2006) vol 80 at
                    cols 2095–2103. However, we would note that if the preliminary urine
                    test on one part of an accused person’s urine sample produces a negative
                    result whereas the tests done by the HSA on the remaining two parts of that
                    urine sample produce positive results, the accused person would not be able to
                    rebut the s 22 presumption if the Prosecution is able to show that the
                    HSA’s tests are more reliable than the preliminary urine test: see
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Ang Soon Huat</em> [1990]
                    2 SLR(R) 246 (“<em>Ang Soon
                    Huat</em>”) at [48], where
                    the High Court held that it was incumbent on the Prosecution to produce
                    additional expert evidence to prove the propriety of its drug analysis
                    procedures in the face of a dispute between experts as to the proper method of
                    conducting such analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Before we turn to the next question pertinent
                    to the issue of compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>),
                    we note that although counsel for the appellant initially argued that
                    reg 5(2) of the Regulations supported his proposition that an analyst had
                    to be continuously present throughout the entire urine-testing process because
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) had to be read harmoniously
                    with reg 5(2) in the event of inconsistency between the two provisions, he
                    accepted that this argument was a non-starter because it inverted the true
                    position. It is the Regulations, being subsidiary legislation, which have to be
                    read harmoniously with the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What the requirement in s 31(4)(b) that each urine test must be
                conducted “by a different person” entails</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The next question which we considered
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) was this: what does the
                    requirement that “[each] urine test shall be conducted …
                    <em>by a different person</em>” [emphasis added]
                    entail? The appellant argued that the Judge was wrong to find that under the
                    HSA’s urine-testing procedures at the material time, each of the urine
                    tests done pursuant to s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) was
                    conducted “by a different person”. The appellant submitted that
                    this was because the rationale of s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)
                    required that in respect of the two parts of the urine sample mentioned in that
                    provision, a person involved in the workflow for one part of the urine sample
                    could not be involved at all in the workflow for the other part of that same
                    urine sample. This was so regardless of whether the person was tasked with
                    actually performing a particular step, or with merely checking that the step was
                    properly carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We rejected the appellant’s argument and
                    agreed with the Judge’s analysis and conclusion (at [270]–[276] of
                    the GD). In our view, the Judge was correct to find that an analyst
                    “conducted” a urine test by means of his analysis and
                    interpretation of the set of chromatograms assigned to him (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). The requirement in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) that each urine test must be
                    conducted “by a different person” refers <em>only</em> to this stage, <em>viz</em>, the stage
                    of analysing and interpreting chromatograms. The HSA’s laboratory
                    protocols prohibit an analyst, when analysing and interpreting the set of
                    chromatograms assigned to him (which chromatograms, as stated at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above, relate to one of the two parts of an
                    accused person’s urine sample mentioned in s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)), from referring to the other set of chromatograms (which
                    relate to the other part of the accused person’s urine sample) assigned to
                    another analyst and/or from discussing the matter with the other analyst. For
                    this reason, the statement in <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> (at
                        [40]) that “the personnel
                    involved in the testing of one urine sample cannot be involved in any way at all
                    in the testing of the other urine sample” is not a correct interpretation
                    of the “by a different person” requirement in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At the material time, the HSA required checks
                    to be carried out on each step in the urine-testing process, beginning from the
                    point of receipt of urine samples from enforcement agencies and ending with the
                    final review by a senior analyst. The appellant argued that this practice
                    breached the “by a different person” requirement in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) because some of the personnel
                    who carried out those checks in the workflow for the set of vials containing one
                    part of an accused person’s urine sample were also involved in the
                    workflow for the set of vials containing the other part of the accused
                    person’s urine sample. In our view, this argument was neither here nor
                    there because the “by a different person” requirement refers only
                    to the stage of analysing and interpreting chromatograms (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). In fact, those checks reinforce the
                    safeguards against error and abuse in favour of accused persons who are
                    factually innocent, <em>eg</em>, they reinforce the
                    safeguards against a mix-up in urine samples at the HSA’s laboratory, thus
                    furthering the legislative purpose of the amendments in 1977 and 1989 (as set
                    out at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Finally, we agreed with the appellant that the
                    phrase “a different officer” in reg 5(2) of the Regulations
                    (which requires the HSA to “arrange for each of the 2 urine specimens to
                    be tested by a different officer”) should be interpreted consistently
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), <em>ie</em>, that phrase should be read as (in the words of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)) “a different person,
                    being either an analyst employed by the [HSA] or any person as the Minister may,
                    by notification in the <em>Gazette</em>, appoint for such
                    purpose”. Although we agreed with the appellant on this particular point,
                    this did not affect our conclusion that the requirements of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) were complied with because the
                    HSA’s urine-testing procedures at the material time stipulated that a
                    different analyst was required to conduct the analysis and interpretation of
                    each set of chromatograms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: The relationship between sections 16, 22 and
                    31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We turn now to the second issue in this
                    appeal, <em>viz</em>, the relationship between ss 16,
                    22 and 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA. In the GD, the Judge
                    also found that, on the assumption that the s 22 presumption did not
                    operate due to non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), the Prosecution had nonetheless proved its case against the
                    appellant on the basis of the s 16 presumption. The appellant advanced the
                    following two arguments against this finding:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     the result of non-compliance with
                            s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) is that the s 16
                        certificates issued by the HSA are either inadmissible or incapable of
                        triggering the s 16 presumption; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     even if the s 16 presumption was triggered
                        in the present case despite non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), the Prosecution had not proved beyond a
                        reasonable doubt that the appellant had consumed methamphetamine because all
                        the methamphetamine detected in the Second and Third Samples (as defined at
                            <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above) was due to
                        pre-contamination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relationship between sections 16 and 22 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We agreed with the Judge (at [30]–[33] of the GD) that ss 16 and 22: (a) exist
                    separately and operate independently of each other; (b) possess different
                    prerequisites; and (c) give rise to presumptions which are different in
                    nature. In other words, they have different functions. We would add that a
                    successful rebuttal of the s 16 presumption would <em>ipso
                        facto</em> constitute a rebuttal of the s 22 presumption (if the
                    latter is triggered in the first place by positive results obtained from two
                    urine tests conducted in accordance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)) because the implicit assumption of s 22 (<em>viz</em>, that the two urine tests mentioned in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) are in themselves accurate in
                    their identification of the specified drug(s) in the urine sample in question)
                    would have been fatally undermined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relationship between sections 16 and 31(4)(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The main arguments on the second issue in this
                    appeal concerned the distinct question of the effect of non-compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) on the operation of s 16.
                    Such non-compliance could possibly have the following effects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the s 16 certificates issued by
                        the HSA would be inadmissible;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     the s 16 certificates would be incapable of
                        triggering the s 16 presumption; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     the non-compliance could be used as a factor in
                        rebutting the s 16 presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether non-compliance with s 31(4)(b) would render s 16
                certificates inadmissible </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The appellant argued that non-compliance with
                    the requirements of s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) would
                        <em>ipso facto</em> render any s 16 certificate
                    inadmissible in evidence. He referred to ss 31(1) and 31(2) of the MDA,
                    which confer a power on certain officers to require the provision of urine
                    samples on pain of conviction. No other authority was cited for this argument,
                    and we rejected it. Sections 31(1) and 31(2) deal with the distinct issue
                    of the power to compel the provision of urine samples, which should not be
                    conflated with the issue of the admissibility of a s 16 certificate issued
                    by, or purportedly issued by the HSA. On its face, all that the MDA provides is
                    that the s 22 presumption is not triggered if there is non-compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>). Hence, such non-compliance
                    simply means that the Prosecution cannot rely on the results of the urine tests
                    conducted by the HSA, as set out in the HSA’s s 16 certificates, as
                    presumptive evidence of consumption. In short, where there is non-compliance
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), the Prosecution would have
                    to prove the <em>actus reus</em> of the s 8(<em>b</em>) offence, <em>ie</em>,
                    consumption, independently of the s 22 presumption. However, a s 16
                    certificate would still be admissible in evidence to show that certain tests to
                    detect the existence and quantity of specified drug(s) in an accused
                    person’s urine sample were done by the HSA. Such tests are capable of
                    proving beyond a reasonable doubt the <em>existence and
                        quantity</em> of specified drug(s) in the accused person’s urine
                    sample (as opposing to proving the accused person’s <em>consumption</em> of such drug(s)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether non-compliance with s 31(4)(b) would render a s 16
                certificate incapable of triggering the s 16 presumption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The appellant also argued that non-compliance
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) would <em>ipso
                        facto</em> mean that the s 16 presumption could not be triggered
                    by any s 16 certificate which purported to certify the existence and/or
                    quantity of a specified drug detected in the urine sample of an accused person.
                    This was the sole basis upon which he challenged the Judge’s finding that
                    the s 16 presumption would nonetheless operate in relation to s 16
                    certificates even if there was non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We also rejected this argument. The plain
                    wording of s 16 shows that the presumption set out therein is triggered by
                    the production of a s 16 certificate purporting: (a) to be signed by
                    an analyst or a person appointed by the Minister by notification in the
                        <em>Gazette</em>; and (b) to relate to a
                    controlled drug or controlled substance. In <em>Lim Boon
                        Keong</em> (at [47]), the
                    judge stated that “a court should not accept a s 16 certificate as
                    presumptive proof that a controlled drug is found in an accused person’s
                    urine if the urine tests were not carried out in compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)”. This statement is
                    ambiguous because it may mean either: (a) that non-compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) renders a s 16
                    certificate incapable of triggering the s 16 presumption; or (b) that
                    such non-compliance can be used to <em>rebut</em> the
                    s 16 presumption. We believe that the judge intended to suggest the latter
                    meaning rather than the former. The evidential issue flowing from the latter
                    meaning is dealt with in the next section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether non-compliance with s 31(4)(b) can be used to rebut the
                s 16 presumption </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    issue of whether non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) can be relied upon to <em>rebut</em> the
                    s 16 presumption, the appellant took no position on this issue as his
                    argument was that such non-compliance had the result of either causing a
                    s 16 certificate to be inadmissible, or causing the s 16 presumption
                    to be inapplicable. The appellant also conceded that he was not challenging the
                        <em>scientific</em> aspects of the analysis which led
                    to the detection of a specified drug and the quantity thereof in a urine
                    sample.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     During the hearing, the Prosecution submitted
                    that although some circumstances which constituted non-compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) could be used to rebut the
                    s 16 presumption, not all instances of non-compliance would result in such
                    a rebuttal. We agreed. Although it is strictly unnecessary for us to deal with
                    this matter in this appeal, given that we agreed with the Judge that the
                    HSA’s urine-testing procedures at the material time fully complied with
                    the requirements of s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), we think it
                    desirable that we give our views on the circumstances in which the s 16
                    presumption can be rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The presumption that has to be rebutted under
                    s 16 pertains to what is set out in a s 16 certificate, <em>viz</em>, the existence of a specified drug and its weight.
                    As we have stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above),
                    the s 8(<em>b</em>) offence pertains to <em>consumption of a specified drug, and not the quantity of specified
                        drug consumed</em>. This is significant because any non-compliance
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) is likely to affect the
                        <em>quantity</em> of specified drug found in an accused
                    person’s urine sample, rather than its <em>existence</em>. Even if a failure to comply with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) is assumed to lead to an
                    inaccurate finding on the quantity of specified drug found in an accused
                    person’s urine sample, it is hardly likely to lead to an error in the
                    detection of that drug’s <em>existence in the urine
                        sample</em>. As we have also stated (likewise at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), once urine samples have been properly
                    collected from an accused person, any error in the detection of the existence of
                    a specified drug in the accused person’s urine samples is possible only
                    where there is a mix-up of the samples (<em>eg</em>, where
                    someone else’s urine sample has been inadvertently tested as that of the
                    accused person), or where the accused person’s urine samples, which were
                    previously free of specified drugs, are contaminated during the process of
                    testing. Suppose we assume that both of the urine tests mentioned in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) were conducted (in the sense
                    described at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) by the same analyst in a clear breach
                    of the provision: although the same analyst conducted both tests, he is still
                    more likely than a non-analyst to reach the results of the tests accurately. The
                    key to rebutting the s 16 presumption is demonstrating forensic inaccuracy,
                        <em>ie</em>, the inaccuracy of the identification
                    and/or quantification of the specified drug purportedly detected: see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Ang Soon Huat</em>. For
                    this reason, it is highly unlikely that the s 16 presumption can be
                    rebutted by showing only that the same analyst conducted both urine tests under
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) in breach of the express
                    stipulation therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Another case of a clear breach of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) would be where the s 16
                    certificate for one of the two parts of the urine sample mentioned in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) is issued by an analyst who
                    did not in fact conduct the urine test on that part of the urine sample. In such
                    a scenario, if the Prosecution were to tender the s 16 certificate signed
                    by the analyst who in fact conducted the urine test on the other part of the
                    same urine sample, it may well be that the court may find that the accused
                    person has failed to rebut the s 16 presumption. In such a scenario, there
                    is nothing in the MDA which prohibits the Prosecution from relying on the
                    probative weight (in the sense of its evidential value) of the s 16
                    certificate relating to the other part of the urine sample to prove the
                        <em>existence</em> of the specified drug as certified
                    by the second-mentioned analyst.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For the avoidance of doubt, we would also
                    reiterate our observation in <em>Tan Chin Hock v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2011] 1 SLR 1079 at [23] and [26] that an
                    accused person who takes issue with the accuracy of a s 16 certificate
                        <em>must</em> cross-examine the analyst (or other
                    authorised person) who apparently or purportedly signed it if the former wishes
                    to take issue with the procedure or the circumstances surrounding the preparing,
                    signing and issuance of the certificate. This is because the s 16
                    presumption, once triggered, operates in relation to all the matters stated in a
                    s 16 certificate. In other words, to rebut the s 16 presumption, an
                    accused person has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that a particular
                    matter stated in a s 16 certificate is incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether all the methamphetamine detected in the Second and Third
                Samples was due to pre-contamination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Apart from the argument that non-compliance
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) rendered the s 16
                    certificates issued in the present case inadmissible or incapable of triggering
                    the s 16 presumption, the appellant also raised the issue of
                    pre-contamination of the Second and Third Samples (<em>ie</em>, contamination during the collection of those urine samples).
                    The Judge rejected this argument on the ground that there was no reasonable
                    doubt that the appellant had consumed methamphetamine because it was fanciful
                    and incredible to argue that the very high level of methamphetamine detected in
                    both the Second and Third Samples was entirely due to pre-contamination (at
                        [43]–[65] of the GD). We
                    agreed with the Judge and likewise rejected the appellant’s argument on
                    pre-contamination. Even if, for example, 80% of the methamphetamine detected in
                    the Second and Third Samples had been present in those samples due to
                    contamination, the fact remains that the remaining 20% of the methamphetamine
                    detected would still have been present due to the appellant’s consumption
                    of that drug. As we mentioned at (<em>inter alia</em>)
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above, for the purposes of the
                        s 8(<em>b</em>) offence, what is crucial in
                    testing a urine sample is the detection of the <em>existence</em> of a specified drug, and not the ascertainment of the
                    quantity of that drug, in the sample.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The third issue: Other ways in which the Prosecution can prove
                consumption outside of the statutory presumptions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     A careful analysis of the legislative
                    framework under s 31 of the MDA for testing urine samples for the presence
                    of specified drugs in connection with drug consumption offences shows that the
                    MDA does not impose an obligation on the Prosecution to undertake any such tests
                    if it does not wish to rely on either the s 22 presumption to prove
                    consumption of a specified drug, or the s 16 presumption to prove the
                    presence and the quantity of specified drug in an accused person’s urine
                    sample. Positive results from urine tests conducted in compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) will trigger the s 22
                    presumption, and also the s 16 presumption if s 16 certificates duly
                    signed by the prescribed signatories are tendered as evidence of the facts
                    stated in the said certificates. However, there is nothing in the MDA which
                    prevents or prohibits the Prosecution from adducing evidence (by means other
                    than s 16 certificates) of reliable scientific tests of an accused
                    person’s urine sample to prove the existence therein of a specified drug,
                    regardless of whether or not the test results trigger the s 16 presumption.
                    If accepted by the court as being reliable, such proof is likely to be
                    sufficient evidence of the fact that the accused person did indeed consume the
                    specified drug found in his urine sample. However, such evidence does not in
                    itself prove that the accused person committed the s 8(<em>b</em>) offence because the Prosecution must further prove that the
                    accused person knew that he was consuming the specified drug in question.
                    Without an admission or a confession of that fact, it would be difficult for the
                    Prosecution to prove it. That was why s 22 was enacted to shift the burden
                    of proving absence of knowledge to the accused person in a drug consumption
                    offence. It therefore behoves the Prosecution to ensure that the HSA complies
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sufficiency of the appellant’s confessions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the present case, the appellant argued that
                    his confessions were, as a matter of law, in themselves insufficient to
                    establish his guilt, and that the effect of ss 31(1) and 31(2) of the MDA
                    in authorising the taking of the Urine Samples from him, on pain of conviction,
                    was to overrule the common law position that a confession, <em>per se</em>, is sufficient in law to convict a person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We did not accept this argument. The
                    urine-testing provisions in s 31 were not intended to abrogate the
                    probative value of a confession. As we have mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above), the urine-testing provisions were
                    intended to shift the burden of proving lack of knowledge of consumption to the
                    accused person. An admissible confession may be sufficient to establish the
                        <em>actus reus</em> of a drug consumption offence to
                    the criminal standard of proof. When deciding whether it in fact does so, the
                    court will of course have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and, in
                    particular, the accused person’s knowledge of and familiarity with the
                    substance which he purported to identify in his confession: see <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> at [53]–[59]. This is an issue of
                    weight, and not admissibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     That said, since the MDA has provided a
                    legislative framework to test the urine samples of accused persons, the courts
                    should be slow to conclude that the <em>actus reus</em> (as
                    opposed to the <em>mens rea</em>) of a drug consumption
                    offence has been proved solely on the basis of confessions if: (a) no urine
                    test, or no urine test conducted in accordance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), has been carried out; and (b) there is no other
                    objective evidence from which the court may infer that the confessions in
                    question are reliable. By way of illustration of when a confession may be
                    treated as reliable in this context, the appellant’s confession of
                    consumption in the present case was supported by his having in his possession,
                    when he was arrested, a pipe which was found to be stained with methamphetamine
                    and also several empty packets (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For these reasons, we agreed with the Judge
                    (at [9]–[14] of the GD) that the Prosecution had
                    proved the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt solely on the basis
                    of his confessions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For the reasons given above, we dismissed the
                    appeal.</p>
