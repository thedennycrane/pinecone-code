<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The plaintiffs are a ship-owning

company incorporated in Thailand. In October 1998, they chartered their vessel, <i>Nopporn

Naree</i>, to the defendants, a Singapore company. The vessel was delivered to the

defendants on 18 October 1998 on the basis that charter hire would be paid every 15 days

in advance. The vessel then took on cargo in accordance with the defendants’

instructions and commenced a voyage to Galverston, Texas, USA which was estimated to take

up to 16 December 1998. The defendants paid charter hire on taking delivery but failed to

pay the next two instalments of hire payable for the periods from 2 November 1998 to 16

November 1998 and from 17 November 1998 to 2 December 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. On 23 November 1998, the plaintiffs

commenced this action to recover the sum of US$175,000 comprising the outstanding hire and

other payments due from the defendants. On the same day, they applied for, and were

granted, a mareva injunction. The specific terms of the order prevented the defendants by

their agents or employees from removing from Singapore or in any way disposing of or

dealing with or diminishing the value of any of their assets which were in Singapore

whether in their own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned up to the value of

US$500,000. This prohibition included the defendants’ assets in their US$ account

with the Rabobank, Singapore branch.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The injunction order was obtained in

the evening. The plaintiffs’ solicitors caused a notice of injunction to be sent at

6.18 pm the same day by facsimile transmission from their firm to the fax number of the

defendants. The actual order and the writ in the action were, however, only physically

served on the defendants on the next day, 24 November 1998. The defendants did not enter

an appearance to the action and judgment in default of appearance was obtained by the

plaintiffs on 31 December 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. In the meantime, on 8 December 1998,

the plaintiffs obtained an order requiring disclosure of assets by the defendants. The

defendants were ordered to inform the plaintiffs in writing at once of all their assets in

Singapore and whether in their own name or not, and whether solely or jointly owned,

giving up to date information about the value, location and details of such assets and

this information had to be confirmed in an affidavit sworn or affirmed by or on behalf on

the defendants and served within seven days of service of the court order. This second

order of court was served on the defendants at their registered office on 10 December

1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. The defendants have three directors

each of whom is also a shareholder in the company. Only one of these directors and

shareholders is resident in Singapore. He is Mr Tay Sien Djim also known Moses Tay. At the

material time, Mr Tay’s address was 92 Seletar Hill Drive, Singapore. On 4 January

1999, a clerk from the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ office went to this address and

served on Mr Tay copies of the first and second injunction orders.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. In the meantime, the plaintiffs’

solicitors had discovered from documents provided to them by the Rabobank pursuant to a

court order that on 24 November 1998 the defendants had withdrawn US$96,000 (equivalent to

S$150,000) from their US$ account at the said bank. The withdrawal had been effected in

stages. First, the sum of US$96,000 was transferred from the defendants’ US$ account

to their Singapore dollar account with Rabobank. This account was credited with S$150,000.

The S$150,000 was immediately withdrawn by way of a cash cheque for this amount drawn by

Rabobank on its account with the Standard Chartered Bank Singapore. The cash cheque was

handed to Mr Tay who had initiated these transactions on behalf of the defendants, and the

same was cashed by Mr Tay at the Standard Chartered Bank’s branch at Battery Road at

about 12.22 pm the same fternoon.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. On 4 February 1999, the defendants

filed an affidavit in purported satisfaction of the second order of court. This affidavit

exhibited a list of the defendants’ assets. This list did not, however, include the

sum of US$96,000 withdrawn from the Rabobank account. Nor did it make mention of any debt

owing to the defendants by Mr Tay.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The plaintiffs took the view that the

defendants and Mr Tay were in contempt of both the orders of court mentioned and applied

for an order of committal against both of them. The plaintiffs applied for Mr Tay to be

committed to prison and for Mr Tay and the defendants to be ordered to restore the sum of

S$150,000 which had been taken from the defendants’ account on 24 November 1998. The

plaintiffs also asked for costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. The contempt proceedings were heard

before me between 13 to 15 September 1999. The stand taken by Mr Tay and the defendants

was that they had had no knowledge of the mareva injunction at the time when Mr Tay cashed

the cheque for S$150,000 and disposed of the proceeds and that therefore they were not in

contempt of court. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found both defendants guilty of

contempt in relation to the handling and disposal of the S$150,000 from the Rabobank

account and ordered both to procure the repayment of that sum to the company’s

account with the said bank. I also found them guilty of contempt in not making a proper

disclosure of the company’s assets in the affidavit of Mr Tay filed on 4 February

1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. Sentencing was postponed for one month

upon the application of the defendants’ counsel. This was to give Mr Tay time to make

the restitution ordered. When court reconvened on 13 October 1999, however, it appeared

that although Mr Tay had made attempts to raise funds he had not been able to do so. After

hearing the mitigation plea, I sentenced Mr Tay to three months’ imprisonment for his

contempt of court. Appeals against conviction have been lodged by both Mr Tay and the

defendants and Mr Tay has also appealed against the sentence imposed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The evidence </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The documentary evidence established

that the defendant company was notified by facsimile transmission at about 6.18 pm on 23

November 1998 of the injunction obtained by the plaintiffs against it. The defendants did

not take the stand that the fax had not been received in their office on that date or at

that time. Their stand was that they had no notice of the injunction that day because the

fax was received after their office closed at about 5.30 pm and that Mr Tay, the only

director present in Singapore, did not see the fax until he arrived at the office sometime

after 1 pm on 24 November 1998. By that time he had already withdrawn the S$150,000 from

Rabobank. The documentary evidence also established that the cash cheque issued by

Rabobank for S$150,000 was cashed by the Standard Chartered Bank at approximately 12.22 pm

that day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The plaintiffs’ evidence in the

contempt proceedings was adduced by way of an affidavit filed by their solicitor, Mr

Augustine Liew which exhibited the court orders, the procedural steps taken by the

plaintiffs and the documents obtained by them about and from the defendants, including

correspondence from the defendants’ solicitors and documents supplied by Rabobank.

The plaintiffs also relied on an affidavit filed by one Mr Woon Kim Leng, a ship broker

who had sent a fax to the defendants’ office on 24 November 1998 and who had spoken

to Mr Hector Goh of the defendants. Mr Woon was cross-examined by the defendants’

solicitors on his affidavit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. The defendants filed two affidavits to

contest the plaintiffs’ allegations. The first was made by Mr Moses Tay and the

second by Mr Goh Hean Sung who was employed by the defendants as a manager between 18 May

1998 and 30 November 1998. Mr Goh did not, however, attend for cross-examination on his

affidavit and I accordingly had to disregard it. The defendants’ only witness was,

therefore, Mr Tay.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. The facts which the defendants wanted

me to find were as set out in Mr Tay’s affidavit of 12 May 1999. He stated that

whilst the registered address of the company was at No. 2 Handy Road #09-08/09 Cathay

Building, its place of business was at 101 Thomson Road, #26-02 United Square. The

registered office was only a secretarial office and its operational hours were between 9

am and 5.30 pm. The defendants operated their own office between 9 am to 6 pm, five days a

week although fax machine, telephone lines and telex machine were on 24 hours a day. At

the material time, the defendants employed two persons namely Hector Goh (presumably that

was Goh Hean Sung), a shipping manager, and Tan Gek Choo, an assistant manager, to assist

Mr Tay in the operations of the defendants’ business. Mr Tay was overall in charge of

operations. The other directors were investors and were not involved with the

defendants’ business.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. Mr Tay said that he was never

personally served with the mareva injunction and the other order of court which formed the

subject matter of the plaintiffs’ application for contempt. The writ and mareva

injunction were only served on the defendants at their registered address on 24 November

1998 at 3 pm although by the time Mr Tay returned to the office at 1 pm on 24 November

1998 he had sight of the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of 23 November 1998

which had been faxed to the business office at about 6.16 pm that day. Mr Tay reiterated

that he was not in the business office at 6.16 pm on 23 November 1998 as he had left for

the day at about 1700 hours. He could not recall exactly where he was nor what he had done

but it was likely that he had gone home. He did not know whether his two employees were in

the business office at the time when the fax was sent but he did not receive any call from

either of them on the evening of 23 November in relation to the fax.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. On 24 November 1998 at about 12 noon,

he was at the Rabobank drawing out the sum of S$150,000 for the purpose of a loan to

himself. He remembered drawing up a cash cheque on 23 November for S$150,000. The next

day, 24<sup> </sup>November 1998, before going to the business office, he attended at the

Rabobank to present the cheque for payment. Rabobank then paid through a Standard

Chartered Bank cheque which he encashed on the same day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. Mr Tay went on to say that during the

period from May 1998 to November 1998 he had periodically made deposits into the Rabobank

account and each deposit had exceeded S$30,000. Similarly he had also made cash

withdrawals from the Rabobank account. He said that in the course of his appointment as a

director of the defendant company, he had made advances amounting to approximately

S$700,000 to the company and had also taken loans of varying amounts from it. As of the

date of the affidavit, the amount which he had borrowed from the defendant company stood

at approximately S$1,050,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. Mr Tay reiterated that at the time

when he encashed the cheque at the Standard Chartered Bank he did not know of the mareva

injunction that was issued and neither was he informed of it by anyone from his office or

from the secretary’s office. He only knew about the injunction when he returned to

his office at about 1 pm on 24 November 1998 and read the documents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. Mr Tay referred to the

defendants’ solicitors’ letter to the plaintiffs’ solicitors on 25 January

1999 and stated that the same explained why he had not been able to comply with the second

order of court, that dated 8 December 1998. He restated the reasons in his affidavit as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) he originally thought that he had to

  obtain a full set of accounts namely the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts and

  therefore upon receipt of the order he proceeded to seek the assistance of the auditors to

  prepare them;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) however, the accounts could not be

  prepared as the bank statements for December 1998 had not been received from the banks and

  also the two foreign directors had not agreed to nor approved the accounts. Mr Tay

  subsequently discovered from Rabobank that as all the defendants’ facilities with

  that bank had been cancelled upon the bank’s receipt of the injunction order the bank

  had not issued any further statement to the defendants after November 1998. He was

  therefore not able to submit bank statements to the plaintiffs.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. Mr Tay said that after receiving a

letter from the plaintiffs’ solicitors on 11 January 1999 he decided to engage a firm

of solicitors to reply on his behalf. It was only then that he discovered that he had to

file a list of the defendant company’s assets and did so on 4 February 1999.

Paragraph 14 of that affidavit he said itemised the quantity of the assets described and

also their value. As these assets were all items of office equipment, they were in the

defendants’ business office at that time. He therefore thought it unnecessary to set

out the location of the items. As to the bank account, Mr Tay stated that it had not

occurred to him that he had to furnish particulars of the bank account. He then went on to

say that as at the date when the order was served the company had had only two bank

accounts, one a US$ account and the other a Singapore dollar account, and both were with

Rabobank. He disclosed the balances of the accounts as being US$3,565.37 and S$7,955.01

respectively.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. The main issue was whether the

defendants had been aware of the injunction order at the time the money from the Rabobank

account had been withdrawn and disposed of. The only evidence on their lack of knowledge

came from Mr Tay. Neither Mr Goh nor his colleague were called to confirm Mr Tay’s

position. The credibility or otherwise of Mr Tay was therefore vital to both parties and

as a result he was cross-examined intensively. His credibility was severely damaged by

this process.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. Mr Tay agreed that as a director of

the defendants he knew of its indebtedness to various creditors. He confirmed that as at

30 November 1998 the defendant company was insolvent because of a net loss of

approximately S$1.09 million. Out of that net loss, S$1.04 million could be attributed to

loans taken by him from the company. As at 23 November, he had owed the company about

S$911,000 and the extra S$150,000 of indebtedness had come from the loan the company made

to him on 24 November. Mr Tay admitted that there was no directors’ resolution which

had authorised any of the loans taken by him. In answer to my question as to who had

authorised the loans, his reply was ‘nobody’. He was asked whether in those

circumstances the taking of the loans amounted to criminal breach of trust. His reply was

there was no question of criminal breach of trust and that he could not be in breach of

trust if the defendants’ shareholders were not taking action against him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. Mr Tay then agreed that he had gone to

Hong Kong on 3 December 1998 to see the shareholders but that up to the date of the

hearing he had not received any approval from the shareholders in respect of the loans

made to him. When he was asked what reason there could have been for the shareholders to

advance to him the S$150,000 which he had borrowed on 24 November 1998, his reply was that

he had no answer to the question and that he did not understand it. It was then put that

there was no reason for the defendants to advance him that money when doing so would

increase the defendants’ insolvency. Again his response was ‘I have no means of

answering this question’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. Later in his cross-examination, Mr Tay

stated that the other shareholders had first known about the various loans which the

company had made him when he visited them in Hong Kong in December 1998. He had told them

that the purpose of the various loans was to settle his gambling debts and this news had

upset them. He tried to persuade them to sign a directors’ resolution approving the

loans but after a series of discussions they told him that they needed time to consider

the matter. He then flew back to Singapore. Thereafter, he called them many times but they

would not agree to sign either the resolution or the company’s accounts. It was clear

to me from this testimony that Mr Tay had treated the defendants’ funds as his own to

be used as suited his convenience and that he had no regard for the legalities which

should have governed the use of such funds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. Mr Tay was queried on the purpose of

the loan of S$150,000. His reply was that it was made to enable him to settle his personal

debt. Subsequently, he was asked whom he had owed this money to. His reply was that he did

not have the full names and details of his creditors. When pressed further as to what he

had done with the S$150,000 Mr Tay said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘I know one Bobby. I gave Bobby

  $150,000 the same day, 24/11/98. I met him in a coffee shop in Toa Payoh at about 7pm.

  Coffee shop in Toa Payoh, Lorong 8. Bobby works for a gambling syndicate. I gambled on

  board a casino ship. That was the Superstar Leo. Bobby’s employer provided me with

  credit for the purpose of gambling. Bobby’s employer provides credit facilities for

  people who gamble on board ships.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. This evidence was interesting because

it indicated that Mr Tay had had the S$150,000 in his hands when he returned to the office

and learnt about the injunction order. Paying the money over to Bobby at 7 pm that night

in full knowledge of the order would have been a flagrant breach of it. Mr Tay gave this

evidence in the morning. After lunch he retracted it. Immediately he took the stand in the

afternoon Mr Tay volunteered the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘In my earlier testimony, I made a

  mistake in relation to the timing of the meeting with Bobby. The particular transaction of

  handing over the money to him was done immediately after withdrawing the money from the

  bank. He was waiting for me outside the bank.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Tay was then asked how he had realised

that 7 pm was the wrong time and his reply was that it was because he had had more than

one transaction with Bobby and that the 7 pm meeting he had mentioned actually referred to

a previous transaction that had taken place about a week earlier. Mr Tay conceded that he

did not keep any diary of what he did and when asked what had prompted him to recollect

something different, his answer was that the break had given him an opportunity to

recollect the events that occurred during the relevant days.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27. More questions were put to Mr Tay

regarding his meeting with Bobby. He said that he had gone to the Rabobank office at

Republic Plaza, Raffles Place around noon or late morning. Bobby waited for him at the

ground floor of Republic Plaza. Then the two of them walked to the Standard Chartered Bank

branch at Battery Road. Mr Tay went into the bank alone. Bobby waited outside the bank.

After Mr Tay cashed his cheque, he left the bank and handed the money over to Bobby in the

street. The money was not in an envelope. He just handed the notes directly to Bobby who

then left. I found it difficult to believe this story. Mr Tay had a cash cheque from

Rabobank. He could have given that cheque to Bobby inside Standard Chartered Bank office

or he could even have given the S$150,000 in cash to Bobby in the bank lobby. Why should

Bobby wait for him on the street? In any case, why should Bobby go with him to both banks

instead of meeting him in the evening at the coffee shop which was their more frequent

meeting place? Mr Tay did not give any reason why in this case the money should have been

handed over outside the bank instead of elsewhere. The only reason I could attribute for

the change in his evidence was his realisation of the implications of what he had said

before the lunch break. It was also noteworthy that he had not deigned to explain his use

of the money in his affidavit. He had only come up with this story in answer to

cross-examination questions. It appeared to me to be an afterthought.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28. There were other difficulties with Mr

Tay’s story of having disposed of the S$150,000 in ignorance of the court order. The

Rabobank statement of account showed that just prior to 24 November 1998, the defendant

company’s US$ call deposit account had a credit balance of US$96.30. On that day a

deposit of US$97,014.03 was made bringing the credit balance up to US$97,110.33. On the

same day, the sum of US$96,000 was withdrawn and this left the account with a balance of

US$1,110.33. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29. Mr Tay stated in evidence that he had

drawn up and signed a cash cheque on the defendants’ US$ account for US$96,000 at

about 5.30 pm on the evening of 23 November. He had done this despite the fact that the

account held insufficient funds to meet this cheque on that date because he knew that a

freight payment due to the defendants would be coming into the account the next day and

because he knew he was not going into the office the next morning since he had to run some

errands. When asked, Mr Tay could not remember what errands he had had to run on the

morning of 24 November. That failure of memory was surprising considering that Mr Tay was

able to remember all the details of his meeting with Bobby on the morning of 24 November

and could specify that he reached the office at 1 pm that day. There were only two

possible reasons why he could not remember the details of his errands. The first was

because there had been no errands to run. The second was because he truly had a bad memory

so that details of what he had done in the past eluded him in which event the details of

his meeting with Bobby could only have been recounted so clearly because he had made them

all up.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30. The next morning, having carried the

signed cash cheque home in his briefcase, Mr Tay went about his errands, carrying the

cheque with him and then went to the bank around noon to cash the cheque. He was not

worried about losing the cheque and explained that he had dated it 24 November although he

had drawn it up on 23 November because he knew he would be able to cash the cheque the

next day. I asked him whether it would not have been safer to carry an uncompleted cheque

leaf around with him. He agreed that that would have been the safer course but said that

he frequently carried large amounts of cash with him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31. I could not accept Mr Tay’s story

that the cheque for S$150,000 was drawn up in the evening of 23 November and post-dated to

24 November because he was absolutely certain that the money would be in the next day. I

think that it is more probable that he checked with the bank on the morning of 24 November

and drew up the cheque that morning when the bank informed him that the money had been

received. He could not admit this because he wanted to maintain the fiction that the

decision to withdraw had been made on 23 November before he could possibly have had notice

of the injunction. It is not credible that Mr Tay could have known for sure on 23 November

that the money would be in the bank the next day even if he had spoken to the remitting

party as he maintained. Intercontinental transfers of money are not instantaneous and even

if a telegraphic remittance is made by one party on one day the recipient cannot be

certain that he will receive it the next day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32. In relation to the other allegation of

contempt of court, Mr Tay was asked why when he filed his affidavit of 4 February 1999

there had been no mention of any debt owing by him to the defendants. His reply was

‘I have no answer’. He had mentioned this indebtedness, however, in two

affidavits which he had filed in other actions. He was asked why the difference. His

answer was that he could only assume that there was no specific request in this action for

a list of debtors. He was then told that in this action there was a request for a list of

assets. Mr Tay made no response for a long time. Finally he said that all that he could

say was that it was probable that the omission was an oversight.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. I was satisfied after hearing and

considering the evidence that the defendants and Mr Tay had had notice of the injunction

order before the sum of S$150,000 was withdrawn from the Rabobank account and definitely

before the money was disposed of by Mr Tay whether by payment to Bobby as he alleged or by

payment to anyone else. I was also satisfied that he had deliberately omitted mention in

his affidavit detailing the defendants’ assets of the amounts in the Rabobank

accounts and the amounts of his indebtedness to the defendant company to try and conceal

the fact that he had disposed of money belonging to the defendants after having had notice

of the mareva injunction. I therefore found him and the defendants guilty of contempt of

court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. As regards sentence, I took the view

that the nature of the contempt was serious. Mr Tay had deliberately disregarded the

court’s order for his own personal benefit and by doing so had put himself and the

company in contempt. He had put his own interests above those of the company and its

creditors. He showed no respect whatsoever for any party other than himself. He was not

able to recover any of the money that he had disposed of despite having known of the

contempt proceedings from at least May 1999 and having been given a further month to raise

money after conviction. By his actions, both the defendant company and its creditors have

suffered. Court orders must be respected and there was no excuse for his conduct. In the

circumstances, I considered that three months was a fair sentence.</font></p>
