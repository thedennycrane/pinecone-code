</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The two properties in question are situated at Carpmael Road, Singapore. One of these properties (“248 Carpmael”) is owned by the first respondent, Robin Loh, and his wife. The other (“246 Carpmael”) was owned by the second respondent, Peter Loh, until he sold it in April 2016.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The basis for the injunction application was a term of a Share Sale Agreement between RGA and the respondents, by which the respondents undertook not to sell the two properties in return for RGA extending loans to KK Asia Environmental Pte Ltd (“KK Asia”), a company in which they are shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The High Court judge (“the Judge”) dismissed the application: see <span class="font-italic">Forest Fibers Inc and another v K</span><span class="font-italic"> K Asia Environmental Pte Ltd and others</span> [2017] 3 SLR 823 (“GD”). This was primarily for the reason that the undertaking in the Share Sale Agreement did not create a caveatable interest in the properties. In the Judge’s view, all RGA had under the Share Sale Agreement was only a personal claim against the respondents for breach of their undertaking not to sell the properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After hearing from counsel for RGA and also from the respondents, who appeared in person, we allowed the appeal but only to the extent that we granted an interim prohibitory injunction to restrain the respondents from selling 248 Carpmael until the determination of Suit 226 or further order. In our view, and with respect, the Judge erred in finding that an interim prohibitory injunction could only be granted if RGA had an interest in land – in this case, a proprietary interest in the properties. An interim prohibitory injunction will normally be granted to restrain the breach of a negative covenant in a contract unless it would cause undue hardship to a defendant. In such cases, the court is not normally concerned with the balance of convenience or whether damages would be an adequate remedy, because it is simply holding the party in breach to the terms of the contract until the determination of the trial. The undertaking in the Share Sale Agreement not to sell the two properties was a negative covenant. The respondents had already breached that undertaking because of Peter Loh’s sale of 246 Carpmael. It was therefore necessary, in our judgment, to restrain them from selling 248 Carpmael and thereby from continuing to breach their contractual undertaking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 We did not grant the mandatory injunction to compel the respondents to pay over the sale proceeds of 246 Carpmael to its solicitors to be held as stakeholders pending further order. Since RGA only sought an interim mandatory injunction as an alternative to the interim prohibitory injunction, there was strictly speaking no need for us to consider this request in light of our decision to grant the interim prohibitory injunction. In any event, a high threshold had to be met for the grant of an interim mandatory injunction and we did not think that threshold was met here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 We now give our reasons for granting an interim prohibitory injunction to restrain the respondents from selling 248 Carpmael until the determination of Suit 226 or further order. We will begin by setting out some background to the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 RGA is a Panamanian company.

</div>
</div> She explained her reasoning in greater detail in the GD which she subsequently issued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 According to the GD, the Judge’s primary reason for dismissing the application was that RGA had no caveatable interest in the properties. In her view, the cases cited by RGA as authority for the grant of an injunction for breach of a negative covenant could be distinguished because they related to negative covenants concerning immovable property or leases. RGA was wrongly attempting to “elevate a personal undertaking given by the [respondents] into a negative covenant pertaining to land” (GD at [51]). It had no caveatable interest in land, only a claim against the respondents for breach of their undertakings in cl 3.7 (GD at [57]). The Judge thus concluded that RGA was seeking “via the ‘backdoor’” and by an interim injunction what had been denied by Abdullah JC in Sum 1255. If RGA “had no basis to lodge the Caveats, it most certainly had no basis to apply for an injunction” (GD at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 There appeared to be another reason why the Judge did not grant the injunction. She did not think the respondents had “deliberately breached a negative covenant merely by a breach of the undertaking in cl 3.7” (GD at [56]). KK Asia was indebted to Standard Chartered Bank (“StanChart”) for a loan that had been guaranteed by the respondents. Thus, the sale of 246 Carpmael might have been to meet the bank’s demand for repayment, by a certain deadline, of a sum of money. Had Peter Loh not sold off 246 Carpmael to repay that debt, there was “every likelihood” that the bank would have foreclosed on and sold the property (GD at [55]–[56]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The general rule, which is well accepted, is that a court will grant an interim injunction to preserve the status quo pending trial if: (a) there is a serious question to be tried; and (b) the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the injunction. As this court suggested in <span class="font-italic">Chuan Hong Petrol Station Pte Ltd v Shell Singapore (Pte</span><span class="font-italic">) Ltd</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Chuan Hong</span>”) at [88], the general rule is founded on the fundamental principle that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his rights at the trial, or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A similar pronouncement can be found in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports </span><span class="font-italic">Co Ltd and another v GMR Male International Airport Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 449 at [53], where this court said that this principle is necessary because the court is asked to assess the balance of convenience at an early stage and based only on affidavit evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Interim injunctions may be of two kinds, prohibitory and mandatory. Interim injunctions are prohibitory if they forbid the commission or continuance of an act. They are mandatory if that they compel the defendant to do some positive act to repair an omission or restore the status quo by undoing some act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The general rule applies to interim prohibitory injunctions except in one particular situation: when a defendant is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant in a contract, and the interim prohibitory injunction sought is to restrain a prospective breach or a further breach, as the case may be. We will expand on this principle from [32] onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The general rule also does not apply where an interim mandatory injunction is sought. Such an injunction is “a very exceptional discretionary remedy” and there is thus “a much higher threshold to be met in order to persuade the court to grant such an injunction as compared to an ordinary prohibitive injunction” (<span class="font-italic">NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 565 (“<span class="font-italic">NCC International</span>”) at [75]; see also <span class="font-italic">Chuan Hong </span>at [84]). Various phrases have been used to express the need for caution in granting an interim mandatory injunction. It has thus been said that such an injunction should only be granted if there are “special circumstances” (<span class="font-italic">NCC International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [75]), in a “clear case” or if there is a “high degree of assurance” that it will appear at trial to have been rightly granted (see <span class="font-italic">Chuan Hong</span> at [85]–[86]). The need for caution arises from the recognition that an interim mandatory injunction is a more invasive remedy and, as such, may lead to irreversible prejudice to a defendant. A court must therefore be sure, in accordance with the fundamental principle described above, that the grant of the interim mandatory injunction is indeed the course of action which carries the lower risk of injustice – in other words, that the prejudice to the applicant from not granting the interim mandatory injunction outweighs that to the defendant from granting it. This will not be an easy hurdle to surmount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 When a defendant is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant in a contract, an interim prohibitory injunction will readily be granted to restrain a prospective breach or a further breach, as the case may be. A clear exposition of the applicable principles may be found in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts Vol 1</span> (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>”) at paras 27-065 and 27-067. We summarise these principles as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A prohibitory injunction to restrain the breach of a negative stipulation in a contract is normally granted as a matter of course. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court is not concerned with the balance of convenience. That damages would be an adequate remedy is not generally a relevant consideration. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As the remedy is an equitable one, it is in principle discretionary, and it may be refused on the ground that it would cause particular hardship as to be oppressive to the defendant. But the burden caused by having to observe the contract does not qualify as hardship. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) These principles above apply equally to the grant of a final injunction as they do to the grant of an interim injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is the same position expressed in the other standard reference works: see Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel on the Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,  13th Ed, 2011) at paras 21-051 and 21-053; Tham Chee Ho, “Non-compensatory Remedies” in Ch 23, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at paras 23.156 and 23.159; Steven Gee QC, <span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Commercial </span><span class="font-italic">Injunctions</span>”) at paras 2-012 to 2-014). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In other words, the general rule we mentioned at [28] does not apply to an application for an interim prohibitory injunction where the defendant is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant in a contract; the court in such a case does not ask itself whether there is a serious question to be tried and whether the balance of convenience is in favour of granting such an interim injunction. The reason for this position, which favours the grant of an injunction, has been put by Steven Gee in this way at para 2-014 of <span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is a strong policy for enforcing bargains and this goes to the extent of enforcing a negative covenant. There is a strong presumption that the covenant will be enforced by injunction, albeit the matter remains discretionary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In line with this strong policy for enforcing bargains, any argument that granting an injunction to uphold a contractual bargain would cause hardship should be “treated with some scepticism, since the defendant has undertaken the obligation voluntarily”: David Bean, Isabel Parry &amp; Andrew Burns, <span class="font-italic">Injunctions </span>(Thomson Reuters, 11th Ed, 2012) at para 2-10. It is for this reason that an injunction will only be refused if a defendant shows hardship over and above that which results from having to observe the contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We think it would be useful to retrace the route that the law has taken to reach this position given that there appears to be little direct authority on this in our jurisprudence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The starting point is commonly taken to be an <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> comment by Lord Cairns LC in <span class="font-italic">Richard Wheeler </span><span class="font-italic">Doherty v James Clagston Allman </span>(1878) 3 App Cas 709 (“<span class="font-italic">Doherty</span>”). It was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> because the case concerned the breach of a positive contractual obligation. Before turning to address that issue, however, Lord Cairns paused to make the following observation (at 719–720): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…if there had been a negative covenant, I apprehend, according to a well-settled practice, a Court of Equity would have had no discretion to exercise. If parties, for valuable consideration, with their eyes open, contract that a particular thing shall not be done, all that a Court of Equity has to do is to say, by way of injunction, that which the parties have already said by way of covenant, that the thing shall not be done; and in such case the injunction does nothing more than give the sanction of the process of the Court to that which already is the contract between the parties. It is not then a question of the balance of convenience or inconvenience, or of the amount of damage or injury – it is the specific performance, by the Court, of that negative bargain which the parties have made, with their eyes open, between themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Although <span class="font-italic">Doherty</span> concerned the grant of a final (or “perpetual”) injunction, this statement of principle by Lord Cairns was applied in the context of interim injunctions in <span class="font-italic">Hampstead &amp; Suburban Properties v Diomedous </span>[1968] 3 WLR 990 (“<span class="font-italic">Hampstead</span>”). There, Megarry J rejected an argument by the party seeking to resist the grant of an injunction that Lord Cairns’ words in <span class="font-italic">Doherty</span> had no application to an interim injunction. That they were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> and uttered in a case concerning final injunctions did not, in his view, “preclude [them] from having any weight or cogency in relation to an interlocutory injunction” (at 997). Megarry J then continued:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where there is a plain and uncontested breach of a clear covenant not to do a particular thing, and the covenantor promptly begins to do what he has promised not to do, then in the absence of special circumstances it seems to me that the sooner he is compelled to keep his promise the better. In such a case I do not think that the enforceability of the defendant’s obligation falls into two stages, so that between the issue of the writ and the trial the defendant will be enjoined only if that is dictated by the balance of convenience and so on, and not until the trial will Lord Cairns’ statement come into its own.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Two points are worth emphasising. First, this statement affirms that the balance of convenience test does not apply when what is sought is an interim prohibitory injunction to restrain the breach of a negative covenant – Megarry J rejected the idea that the defendant would only be enjoined if that was “dictated by the balance of convenience”. Second, Megarry J said that an interim prohibitory injunction should normally be granted “in the absence of special circumstances”. That qualifies Lord Cairns’ statement, which is in more absolute terms, that a court would have had “no discretion to exercise” as long as the injunction was sought to restrain a breach of a negative covenant (see [35] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Indeed, courts in Australia and Hong Kong have, while adopting Lord Cairns’ statement in <span class="font-italic">Doherty</span>, eschewed the idea that a court would have “no discretion to exercise” when what is sought is a prohibitory injunction to restrain the breach of a negative covenant. In the High Court of Australia’s decision of <span class="font-italic">Dalgety Wine Estates Pty Ltd v Rizzon </span>(1979) 141 CLR 552, Gibbs J said (at 560) that Lord Cairns’ statement about there being no discretion appeared to be an “overstatement” and Mason J said (at 573) that it was “not accurate”. Nonetheless the court was in accord with the general principle that an injunction would normally be granted to restrain a breach of a negative covenant. It cited with approval (at 560) the following statement of principle from its previous decision in <span class="font-italic">J</span><span class="font-italic"> C Williamson Ltd v Lukey and Mulholland </span>(1931) 45 CLR 282 at 299:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If…a clear legal duty is imposed by contract to refrain from some act, then, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, an injunction should go to restrain the doing of that act. It appears to be of little importance now whether the duty is imposed by a term of the contract expressed in negative or affirmative language.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the Hong Kong Court of Appeal’s decision of <span class="font-italic">The Incorporated Owners of South Seas Centre, Mody Road v Great Treasure Development</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd </span>[1994] HKCA 416, Godfrey JA said that Lord Cairns’ statement had never been cited to “exclude altogether the general discretionary considerations which always fall to be considered when the question for the court to decide is whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction” (at [14]). Godfrey JA then formulated the applicable principles as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a defendant is proposing to act in breach of an express negative stipulation binding upon him he will normally be enjoined from doing so, and, save in exceptional cases, damages will not be regarded as an adequate remedy; but the defendant may nonetheless be able to establish special circumstances of such a nature that the hardship that the making of the order would cause him would so far outweigh the inconvenience to the plaintiff through denying the plaintiff specific relief that the court considers that its intervention would be unjust, In addition, general discretionary considerations, such as unfairness, acquiescence or delay, may make the grant of an interlocutory injunction inappropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We agree that the “general discretionary considerations” as mentioned in this extract may be considered in deciding whether or not the grant of an interim prohibitory injunction would be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The cases above contemplate that this particular rule on injunctions applies to restrain all manner of breaches of negative contractual obligations. But, in the present case, the Judge found that the principles in <span class="font-italic">Doherty </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hampstead</span> were inapplicable because they had “nothing to do with negative or any covenants concerning immoveable property or leases” (GD at [51]). There is, however, clear authority that this particular rule is not limited in this way, although it should be said in fairness that this authority was not cited to the Judge. In <span class="font-italic">Vefa Ibrahim </span><span class="font-italic">Araci v Kieren Fallon </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 668 (“<span class="font-italic">Araci v Fallon</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>an interim prohibitory injunction was granted to restrain a jockey from acting in breach of a negative covenant in his contract with a racehorse owner not to ride a rival owner’s horse; the injunction was necessary because the jockey had informed the owner a week before a derby that he would be riding a rival owner’s horse. This case did not concern any negative covenant pertaining to land, yet the court applied the principles articulated in <span class="font-italic">Doherty</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hampstead</span> in reaching its decision. With respect, therefore, we could not endorse the Judge’s attempt to confine the principles in <span class="font-italic">Doherty </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hampstead</span> to breaches of negative covenants pertaining to land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We would make two further comments about <span class="font-italic">Araci v Fallon</span>. First, it appears that there was no consensus between the two Lord Justices who heard the appeal about whether the adequacy of damages was a relevant consideration in determining whether an injunction should be granted to restrain a breach of a negative covenant. Jackson LJ found that it was a relevant consideration and went on to find that an award of damages in lieu of an injunction would not be an adequate remedy (at [53]). Elias LJ, on the other hand, found that the adequacy of damages was “not generally a relevant consideration when the injunction restrains the breach of a negative covenant”, because the court was simply enforcing the bargain of the parties (at [70]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We prefer the view that the adequacy of damages is not a relevant consideration. We note that this is the position taken in academic works such as <span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions </span>at para 2-014 and <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>at para 27-065. This appears to us correct as a matter of policy. If a plaintiff seeks an interim prohibitory injunction to restrain a defendant from breaching, or continuing to breach, a negative covenant, the court, in refusing the injunction, would essentially be allowing a defendant to breach his contractual obligations on the basis that the plaintiff can be compensated for this by damages later. The court would effectively be releasing the defendant from its contractual bargain. It does not seem right to us that the court should lend its aid to such a course of conduct, unless the circumstances are exceptional – for example, if not doing so would cause undue hardship to the defendant. Otherwise, the court should, where possible, uphold contractual bargains (provided of course that there has been or will be a clear breach of a negative covenant).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The second comment concerns the relevance of the manner in which a defendant has breached or is about to breach the negative covenant. In <span class="font-italic">Araci v </span><span class="font-italic">Fallon</span>, Elias LJ held that an injunction may be refused if it is oppressive, but that it would hardly be oppressive to prevent one from “acting in cynical disregard of the obligations he has voluntarily undertaken” (at [70]). Jackson LJ echoed this point in explaining why the judge below had been wrong to refuse the injunction: he said that the defendant “voluntarily entered into a contract for substantial reward containing both positive and negative obligations” and there was nothing special about the world of racing entitling the major players to “act in flagrant breach of contract”; therefore, the defendant’s promise should be enforced (at [65]). In a similar vein, Steven Gee QC notes that “[u]nreasonable or heavy-handed conduct in breach of a negative covenant can be a strong factor reinforcing the case for an injunction” (<span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions</span> at para 2-014). These statements show that it is hardly right to refuse an injunction when a defendant has breached a negative covenant deliberately or is about to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We should add that prior to this case, the only decision of our courts which appears to have considered <span class="font-italic">Doherty </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hampstead </span>was <span class="font-italic">Rajaram v Ganesh (trading as Golden Harvest Trading Corp) and others </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 79. The judge in that case made reference to the principle that where there was a clear breach of a negative covenant, the balance of convenience test would not apply (at [27]–[28]). However, the case is not a direct authority for determining when a prohibitory injunction would be granted to restrain a breach of a negative covenant. The interim injunction in that case had been granted to restrain a bank from calling on, invoking or encashing a guarantee on the ground that it knew that the person for whose benefit the guarantee had been issued had not complied with a condition for the issue of the guarantee. Thus, the bank would be participating in the beneficiary’s breach by paying money to him under the guarantee. In other words, the interim injunction against the bank was not based on its own breach of any negative covenant but on its knowledge of the beneficiary’s breach of the terms of the guarantee. In this regard, although, like the Judge, we had doubts about the relevance of this case to the present application, our reasons for so thinking differed from hers (see GD at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prohibitory injunction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We now explain why we granted the interim prohibitory injunction to restrain the respondents from selling 248 Carpmael, thus reversing the Judge’s decision in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In our view, and with respect, the Judge’s first reason for refusing to grant the injunction was based on an error. The Judge erred in assuming that because cl 3.7 of the Share Sale Agreement did not create any interest in land in favour of RGA, thus giving RGA no basis for lodging a caveat against the properties, RGA could not obtain an interim prohibitory injunction to prevent a breach of the negative covenant in the Share Sale Agreement. By making this assumption, she was led to the conclusion that since Abdullah JC had dismissed RGA’s application in Sum 1255 to lodge caveats against the properties, it should follow that RGA’s application for an injunction should similarly be dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, the fact that there was no interest in land, and hence no basis for lodging a caveat, could not conclusively determine whether an injunction could be granted. In assuming that an interim prohibitory injunction could only be granted if RGA had a caveatable interest in the properties, the Judge conflated the contractual right of RGA to insist that the respondents not sell their properties with a proprietary right in those properties. Whether RGA also has a proprietary interest (by way of a charge, as it claims) is an issue that will be decided in Suit 226 itself. At this stage, RGA was only seeking to enforce a contractual right that it undoubtedly has in cl 3.7 of the Share Sale Agreement. As we have mentioned, there is clear authority that an interim prohibitory injunction will normally be granted to restrain the breach of a negative covenant in a contract because that gives effect to the contract between the parties. To adapt Megarry J’s words in <span class="font-italic">Hampstead</span>, the respondents here promptly began to do what they had promised not to do. In the absence of special circumstances, the sooner they were compelled to keep their promise, the better. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We did not think there were such special circumstances in the present case. The only reason the respondents could put forth to resist the grant of the injunction was that they were in financial difficulty. Ordinarily, that would not have constituted a good enough reason for not holding them to their contractual bargain. There was no suggestion that their financial difficulties were particularly grave or dire such that the grant of the injunction might cause them undue hardship. In fact, they had informed the Judge during the hearing below that they had no intention of selling 248 Carpmael.

</div>
</div>
</div> That afforded an additional reason for us to think that the grant of the injunction would not cause them any undue hardship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any event, as we informed the respondents during the hearing of this appeal, if they should need to sell 248 Carpmael, it was open to them to apply to lift the interim prohibitory injunction. But they would need to show that the continued existence of the injunction would cause them undue hardship or be oppressive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We were also not convinced by the second reason given by the Judge for refusing the injunction – that is, that the respondents had not deliberately breached cl 3.7. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Judge thought that the respondents might have been “forced by circumstances” to sell 246 Carpmael in order to stave off legal proceedings. But that did not mean that the breach of cl 3.7 was not deliberate. The respondents (specifically, Peter Loh) still chose to sell 246 Carpmael despite knowing that cl 3.7 obliged them not to sell the properties. It was true that StanChart had informed KK Asia by a letter dated 25 January 2016 that the latter was in default under the terms of their banking facility which was secured by a mortgage over 246 Carpmael. StanChart warned that it would take steps to protect their interests including commencing legal proceedings against the mortgagor. But there was no evidence that StanChart, as the mortgagee, had foreclosed on 246 Carpmael. Had that been what happened, it might be asked whether there was in fact a breach of the negative covenant in cl 3.7 in the first place. We noted that the mortgage was executed in favour of StanChart even before the respondents had entered into the Share Sale Agreement – the title search on 246 Carpmael showed that StanChart lodged a caveat as mortgagee on 21 October 2014.

</div>
</div> However, these were not the facts before us. As far as the evidence in this case showed, the respondents made the conscious decision to sell 246 Carpmael. That was a deliberate breach of cl 3.7. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In any event, even assuming that the respondents’ breach of cl 3.7 had not been deliberate, that only meant that the case for an injunction was not as strong as it otherwise would have been. As we highlighted at [43], if a defendant has acted in deliberate or even flagrant breach of a contractual obligation, a court is less likely to have any hesitation in granting the injunction. However, it does not follow that an injunction can only be granted if the breach is deliberate. As long as the breach is uncontested, the cases show that the injunction should be granted as a matter of course to prevent a continued breach of that obligation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mandatory injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 However, we found no reason to grant the interim mandatory injunction to compel the respondents to pay over to RGA’s solicitors the net sale proceeds of 246 Carpmael. Since it was an alternative prayer to its prayer for the interim prohibitory injunction, there was strictly speaking no need for us to deal with it. In any case, as we have said at [31] above, the threshold for granting such an injunction was a high one. We were not persuaded that this threshold had been crossed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 RGA argued that the risk of injustice to them if the mandatory injunction were refused was far greater than the risk of injustice to the respondents if the injunction were granted. It contended that there was a risk, in light of the respondents’ precarious financial situation, that any judgment it obtained against them would be a paper judgment.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We could not see why RGA should be placed in a better situation than any other creditor of the respondents. As we mentioned, until Suit 226 was heard and the effect of cl 3.7 determined, RGA could not be said to have any security in the properties or their sale proceeds. Before us, RGA readily accepted this. Counsel for RGA explained during the hearing of the appeal that they would only hold the sale proceeds as a stakeholder; were any creditor to come to it and assert, for example, that it had an enforceable judgment against the respondents, they would have to satisfy that creditor’s judgment debt from the sale proceeds held by them. But that would only raise the question as to the purpose of compelling the respondents to pay over the sale proceeds to RGA’s solicitors in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For the reasons given, we allowed the appeal to the extent mentioned at [4] above.
