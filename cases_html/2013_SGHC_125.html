        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant was driving his 13-year-old son to
                    school in the morning of 3 May 2011 along Bartley Road, ‘battling the
                    morning rush hour’, according to the trial judge, when he swerved into the
                    complainant taxi-driver’s path. Temper quickly overcame both drivers with
                    one sounding his car horn and the other (the appellant) gesturing with his
                    finger (he claimed that he raised his hand but not finger). When the vehicles
                    stopped, the appellant noticed that the taxi-driver had picked up his camera to
                    take a picture of the appellant and his car, and that somehow increased the
                    appellant’s rage. He got out of his car and walked to the taxi driver who
                    was attempting to take his picture. These were the uncontroversial
                facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The taxi-driver’s account thereafter was
                    that the appellant went up to his taxi and tried to wrest the camera from him,
                    and at the same time he shouted ‘Give me the camera you fucking bastard,
                    or I will punch your face.’ When he failed to get the camera, the
                    appellant walked back to his car but he turned back when he saw that the
                    taxi-driver was still using the camera. He walked back to the taxi and tried
                    once more to grab the camera. The taxi-driver used his right hand to fend off
                    the appellant. That was when the appellant pulled the taxi-driver’s middle
                    finger causing a sharp pain. The doctor, Dr Seah Chee Yong (“Dr
                    Seah”), who examined the taxi-driver testified that his examination and
                    the x-ray report showed that the taxi-driver suffered an ‘avulsion
                    fracture of the right middle finger at the third middle
                phalanx’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant denied that he had shouted
                    vulgarities at the taxi-driver and that it was the taxi-driver who used
                    vulgarities. He denied touching the taxi-driver at all. The trial judge accepted
                    the taxi-driver’s version and convicted the appellant on charge under
                    s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal
                    Code”) for causing grievous hurt to the taxi-driver, and sentenced the
                    appellant to eight months imprisonment. The appellant was also ordered to pay
                    $120 as compensation under s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 15 of
                    2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant appealed against conviction and
                    sentence. So far as the conviction was concerned, Mr Gopinath Pillai,
                    counsel for the appellant, realised that the appellant had to offer an
                    alternative account of the taxi-driver’s injury. Thus counsel submitted
                    that the avulsion fracture could have been caused when the tax-driver tapped
                    that finger vigorously and repeatedly against the driver’s window of his
                    taxi. Counsel had hoped that the brief account at trial where the appellant had
                    claimed that the taxi-driver ‘jabbed his finger’ at him in a vulgar
                    way, might help raise a reasonable doubt that the injury was inflicted by the
                    appellant. The main defence at trial appeared to be a denial of contact and
                    thus, the injury was fabricated by the taxi-driver. The trial judge disbelieved
                    the appellant’s account. On the evidence, I am of the view that there is
                    no basis for this court, on appeal, to interfere with those
                findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In respect of the sentence, it was clear that
                    the judge took into account the fact that the charge was not just the usual road
                    rage offence because the appellant in this case was charged for causing grievous
                    hurt and not simple hurt. It is plain that the former is a much more serious
                    charge because the injuries contemplated under s 325 of the Penal Code are
                    serious and debilitating ones. One of those injuries that would bring a case
                    within the ambit of s 325 is a fracture injury. However, in this case, the
                    medical evidence and the evidence of the taxi-driver showed that while the
                    injury to the middle finger had caused pain and was properly diagnosed as an
                    avulsion fracture, it was, in fact, not as serious as the term
                    ‘fracture’ suggested. Dr Seah described the injury as a
                    ‘sprain injury’ although the pain could be ‘quite
                    great’. There was some swelling of the finger, but the taxi-driver did not
                    require hospitalisation, and Dr Seah testified that the taxi-driver was
                    ‘treated non-operatively’. The injury did not prevent the
                    taxi-driver from continuing to drive and work. Subsequent follow-up indicated
                    that the injury healed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I take into account the finding that the injury
                    was caused by the appellant pulling the taxi-driver’s finger (in the
                    course of trying to grab the camera), and that apart from that no other violence
                    was used. Cases of road rage offenders charged under s 325 have shown more
                    aggravating circumstances: in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Seck
                        Hing</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 374;
                    [1992] SGHC 185, the accused had fractured the victim’s right
                    arm, tailed the victim to the hospital, then threatened him with further injury
                    while he was apologising; while in <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan
                        Eng Heong</em> [2010] SGDC 303, the accused had hit the victim with a
                    wooden pole a few times and only ceased because he had to resume control of his
                    car. It seems to me that although the charge and the conviction were proper and
                    correct, the circumstances indicated that this case was more akin to a case of
                    causing simple hurt in the course of a road rage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Even so, comparing this case with other road
                    rage cases in which simple hurt was caused, the injury caused was not in fact as
                    serious as some others. In <em>Neo Ner v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> (MA 113 of 2000, unreported), the accused was
                    sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for slamming the victim’s
                    car door in the victim’s face, causing a laceration to the cheek and back
                    of his head; in <em>Ong Kok Leong &amp; Tay Liang Seah v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> (MA 195 and 196 of 2008, unreported), the first
                    accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment for punching the victim
                    on his face and chest a few times; in <em>PP v Goh Kah
                        Sia</em> [2010] SGDC 166, the accused was sentenced to two
                    weeks’ imprisonment for punching the victim repeatedly on the forehead. It
                    can be surmised that the circumstances in this case in which the injury was
                    caused (pulling at the finger) was not as severe as some other more aggravating
                    assaults following a road rage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The appellant was hitherto a person of good
                    character and this was his first offence. It was not premeditated and had
                    occasioned from a lack of control. It seems unlikely that with this experience
                    he would likely commit this offence again. In the circumstances, I am of the
                    view that the sentence was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The appeal against conviction is dismissed. The
                    sentence in so far as the imprisonment was concerned is varied from eight months
                    to two weeks.</p>
