The acquisition of Curacao Bank was negotiated by Feng. After the acquisition of Curacao Bank, 5672 (or 11.344%) of BSI’s shares would be transferred from D1 and D2 to P1, as evinced by the shareholders’ agreement dated 8 October 2018 executed by P1 and BSI (“SHA”). Under the SHA, funds for the purchase of Curacao Bank would be placed in the bank account (“WPS Account”) of Walkers Professional Services Limited (“WPS”).

D3 and 5&amp;2 would deposit monies which D2 and D1 raised from investors into the WPS Account. Feng had given D2 the “false impression” that the WPS Account was maintained by Walkers, and had “all along told [D2] that WPS was an entity that was controlled by Walkers”. However, WPS was incorporated by Feng in the BVI and wholly owned by Feng’s wife.

</div> By October 2018, D2 had transferred US$5,184,000 and S$400,000 (including the majority of the sums raised from P1) to the WPS Account for the purchase of Comoros and Curacao Banks. Feng then informed D2 that the purchase of Comoros Bank for US$4 million had been completed and that he had renamed it as REB. Feng said that there was no need to purchase Curacao Bank as REB would fit their purpose of providing offshore banking services. D2 agreed with Feng to discontinue the purchase of Curacao Bank and subsequently asked for the return of the balance of monies not used for that aborted purchase.

The SHA provided that the BVI courts “shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement”. Hence, this court should be slow to grant a Mareva injunction to P1, who had commenced Suit 916 in breach of the exclusive jurisdiction clause. Further, clause 22.1 of the SHA provided that the SHA “constitute[s] the entire contractual relationship between the parties in relation thereto and there are no representations, promises, terms, conditions or obligations between the parties other than those contained or expressly referred to therein”. As such, even if the alleged representations were made to P1 and Charles, they were rendered irrelevant by this entire agreement clause.

Thus, a claim for breach of the SHA would not lie against the Defendants and P1 is not precluded from bringing a claim in tort against them. In any event, the SHA states that it “does not restrict liability of any party arising as a result of any fraud”. Furthermore, unless it is clearly expressed, an entire agreement clause only denudes any pre-contractual statements or representations of contractual effect and the mere inclusion of the word “representation” in an entire agreement clause does not necessarily exclude liability for misrepresentation: <span class="font-italic">Creative Technology Ltd and another v Huawei International Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 201 at [79] and [82]; <span class="font-italic">RBC Properties Pte Ltd v Defu Furniture Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 997 at [113].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on misrepresentation claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In conclusion, I found there to be a good arguable case for P1’s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against the Defendants.

He alleged that D3 (and D2) knew that WPS was his personal vehicle and that his investment in the Bank Acquisition was in his personal capacity; and that D3 knew and had agreed to Comoros Bank (or REB) being returned to the seller who would provide Feng and D3 with another entity of a similar name to REB. Therefore, whether Feng did or did not defraud the Defendants is a live issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Having found that P1 has a good arguable case against the Defendants for fraudulent misrepresentation, it was not necessary to assess if it has a good arguable case for all of its alternative cases, for the purposes of the Mareva injunction application. Nevertheless, I analysed one other claim, namely for conspiracy. I found that P1 also has a good arguable case against the Defendants for lawful or unlawful means conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The matters which I had raised in relation to P1’s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation would also support a good arguable case in conspiracy, and I do not intend to repeat them, save to note a few points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 When Feng informed D2 in late 2018 that he had purchased Comoros Bank for US$4 million and there was no need to purchase Curacao Bank, the question remained as to why D2 did not then inform P1 (or inform D1 to inform P1) that a different bank had been purchased; that the purchase price was only US$4 million; and that Curacao Bank would not be purchased. It bears repeating that P1’s claim that D1 had informed him in November 2018 that the bank acquisition had been completed and that Curacao Bank was doing well was not denied by D1 on affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The is a good arguable case that D2 had maintained the same storyline as D1 to give the impression that Curacao Bank had been acquired.

He pleaded that, originally, Feng, D1 and he had planned to buy Curacao Bank but Feng negotiated with the seller to purchase both Curacao and Comoros Banks. D1 and D2 turned to investors to raise funds to purchase “the two” banks, and D1 secured P1 as an investor.

This leaves doubts as to when Feng had negotiated to purchase two banks; whether this was informed to P1 when he was approached to invest; and why the SHA (executed later) mentioned only Curacao Bank.

He claimed that, in December 2018, he asked Feng to return the balance of US$4,510,000 (“Balance Sum”) which was not used for the purchase of Comoros Bank, but Feng did not return it to him. Despite knowing that Feng had changed the parameters of the bank acquisition to only Comoros Bank and of the substantial reduction in the purchase price, there was no evidence that D2 did anything to ensure that Feng returned the Balance Sum after he asked Feng for it. Whilst there were messages from 6 to 11 December 2018 where D2 asked Feng to return the Balance Sum, there was no evidence that D2 chased Feng after 11 December 2018 even though Feng said he would “update” D2.

I will refer to these representations as the “Europe Transaction Representations”. D1 said the Europe Transaction would take place face to face and the buyer would pay in cash, and the Defendants had engaged a security company (called SGS) to be present to ensure that the cash collected would be legitimate. D1 further informed RG that the Europe Transaction was a legitimate opportunity for the latter to sell cryptocurrency for €5,000,000.

</div> There is a good arguable case that D1 made the representations on D2 and D3’s behalf and with their knowledge and consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 D1 claimed that the funds managed and trades performed for RG were solely at D3’s discretion, and he represented the Europe Transaction as a legitimate opportunity by RG to sell cryptocurrency, as D3’s agent. D1 attested that he conducted the cryptocurrency transactions on D3’s behalf and through D3; that the buyer for the Europe Transaction (“the Buyer”) was sourced by D2; that D1 was a middleman who relayed information by updating RG on the transaction and he obtained such information from D2 and/or D3.

D2 also knew and allowed D1 to use D3 to receive proceeds from cryptocurrency trades for third parties, as D1 would share the commission he received with D2 and D3.

</div> The KippCo Agreement and SGS’s 8 April 2019 letter further cast doubts on the legitimacy of the Defendants’ intentions behind the Europe Transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Third, the contractual relationships between SGS and KippCo, and KippCo and D3, were odd in light of the Defendants’ claim as to the roles of SGS and KippCo. The Defendants claimed that SGS was engaged to authenticate the Banknotes <span class="font-italic">for D3</span>, whilst KippCo’s role was to receive the moneys from the Buyer into KippCo’s account for onward transfer to D3. If that were the case, it was strange that SGS was not directly engaged by D3. D2 further claimed that D3 engaged KippCo as KippCo would not face any problems with depositing €5,000,000. The Defendants have not explained what “problems” D3 would face in obtaining €5,000,000 directly from the Buyer. During the Europe Transaction, D3’s DBS Account was still alive. D2 also stated that KippCo would then transfer the €5,000,000 to D3. It is unclear why D3 could not have received €5,000,000 directly from the Buyer when it could receive this sum from KippCo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Fourth, the Defendants’ version that SGS had conducted the security check on the Banknotes appears to be suspect. RG claimed that, around 27 April 2018, D1 had informed it that he had transferred 554.66 BTC to the Buyer but that the Banknotes were counterfeit. D1 also informed RG that the Banknotes were “very good fakes” and had passed SGS’s assessment method called the “blot test” but the Banknotes still turned out to be fakes. D1 admitted to this narrative.

He asked D1 to transfer this to P1 since P1 had paid D1 926 ETH as part of the MT Investment. D1, instead, promptly transferred the 900 ETH to another ETH wallet on 5 July 2019 (undisputed by D1), leaving only about 5 ETH in his wallet.

D1 is based overseas and has not stated what assets he has.
