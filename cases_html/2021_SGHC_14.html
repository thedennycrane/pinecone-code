</div> In brief, under each CNSA, each Kuwaiti Investor agreed to make an interest-free loan to the Company subject to an obligation to convert his loan into shares as soon as the Company next received fresh investment. The shares were to be allotted to each Kuwaiti Investor at the same price as they were being allotted to the investor making the fresh investment. As the upside on his investment, each Kuwaiti Investor was entitled to have every US$1.00 of his loan treated as being worth US$1.30 for the purposes of the conversion.

</div> The plaintiffs’ claim against the first defendant is therefore that <span class="font-italic">he</span> made certain misrepresentations to them which caused them to enter into the CNSAs with <span class="font-italic">the Company</span>. On the plaintiffs’ case, this is therefore a tripartite situation involving two contractual counterparties (a Kuwaiti Investor and the Company) and a representor who is not a party to the contract (the first defendant). Framed in this way, the plaintiffs’ Misrepresentation Claim cannot be brought within the scope of the Act. That is because the Misrepresentation Act applies only in a bipartite situation: where a party to a contract made a misrepresentation to the counterparty to that same contract which induced the counterparty to enter into the contract. The plaintiffs’ Misrepresentation Claim can therefore rest only in tort at common law and not on the Misrepresentation Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Second, insofar as it rests in tort, the plaintiffs rely for the Misrepresentation Claim only on fraudulent misrepresentation. They plead no alternative claim against the first defendant for negligent misrepresentation upon the principle in <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne</span><span class="font-italic"> v Heller</span> [1964] AC 465. Therefore, if the plaintiffs fail to establish that the first defendant made the Representations fraudulently, their Misrepresentation Claim fails entirely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 With those preliminary points out of the way, I now turn to consider the plaintiffs’ Misrepresentation Claim, confined as it is to common law misrepresentation and the tort of deceit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What the plaintiffs must prove</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is common ground that, in order to succeed in their claim in fraudulent misrepresentation, the plaintiffs must establish the following facts (<span class="font-italic">Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the first defendant made to them a representation of fact by words or conduct which is false;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That the first defendant made the representation with the intention that the plaintiffs should act in reliance upon it;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) That the plaintiffs did indeed act in reliance on the representation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) That the plaintiffs have suffered damage by acting in reliance on the representation; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) That the first defendant made the false representation knowing that it is false or in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The heart of the plaintiffs’ plea on the Misrepresentation Claim is in paragraphs 9 to 11 of their statement of claim. In paragraph 9, the plaintiffs plead that the first defendant made the Representations in order to induce the plaintiffs to invest in the Company. In paragraphs 10 and 11, they plead that the Representations did induce the plaintiffs to invest in the Company and to enter into the CNSAs.

The plaintiffs have failed to discharge this burden. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The events underlying this action can be divided into three critical phases. Phase 1 is the period between October 2012 (when discussions began about the Kuwaiti Investors investing in the Company (see [9] above)) and May 2013 (when the plaintiffs entered into the CNSAs (see [14]–[15] above)). Phase 2 is the period from May 2013 until April 2015 (when the Kuwaiti Investors expressed an intention to exit their investment (see [24] above)). Phase 3 is the period from April 2015 until March 2016 (when the plaintiffs commenced this action). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The crucial period for the Misrepresentation Claim is, of course, Phase 1. The Representations must precede the CNSAs, otherwise the Representations cannot have induced the plaintiffs to enter into the CNSAs. But a significant difficulty which the plaintiffs face in discharging their burden is that there is no direct evidence of the Representations in any of the documents which the parties generated in any of these three phases. Indeed, some of the documents, particularly those generated in Phase 3, are completely inconsistent with the inherent probabilities if the plaintiffs’ case were true. I analyse these documents further at [144]–[148] and [91]–[115] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is not, of course, unusual for there to be no evidence of the Representations in the documents. It is common for a plaintiff to base a misrepresentation claim on misrepresentations which are entirely oral. These plaintiffs are no exception.

It is, of course, true that if several witnesses testify to the same events, their accounts will inevitably bear similarities. But the 32 passages which the first defendant’s counsel identified were not mere similarities. These passages were replicated verbatim or almost verbatim right down to the punctuation and the turns of phrase. The first defendant’s counsel is correct that “[t]he replication of content was not just in substance, but also in exact literal form, so much so that vast tracts of the [these four witnesses’ affidavits of evidence in chief] were indistinguishable from each other”.

Those affidavits were then put in front of those three witnesses who, at best, skim read them without concentrating on the detail before affirming them.

Mr Albader is not, of course, a plaintiff in this action. He could not have played any part in discontinuing this action against the second defendant.

</div> This association is in my view sufficient to raise a real possibility that he is not a wholly impartial witness. This may also explain Mr Albader’s failure to own the preparation of his own affidavit of evidence in chief and to attain mastery of its contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 However, my finding that the affidavits of evidence in chief of the second plaintiff, Mr Sobers and Mr Albader are not corroborative of the first plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief does not, in itself, undermine the weight of the first plaintiff’s own evidence. That is because I accept, contrary to the first defendant’s submission, that the source of the evidence in the first plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief is his own independent memory of the relevant events, assisted in the usual way by reviewing the relevant documents. The shortcomings in the preparation of the other witnesses’ affidavits of evidence in chief was, in that sense, downstream from and unconnected to the source of the first plaintiff’s evidence in chief. The veracity of the first plaintiff’s evidence will therefore have to be assessed like all other oral evidence: by weighing it in the light of the opposing oral evidence, the independent and objective evidence and the associated inherent probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second defendant’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I turn now to consider the evidence of the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The second defendant admitted in cross-examination that he was not present at any of the discussions between the Kuwaiti Investors and the first defendant in November and December 2012 at which the plaintiffs allege the first defendant made the Representations.

</div> His evidence was that the first defendant had made these statements to him both before and after he joined the company. That does not, in itself, assist the first plaintiff on the Misrepresentation Claim. To succeed on that, the plaintiff must prove that the first defendant made the Investment Exit Representation to the plaintiffs before May 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Plaintiffs’ counsel asked specifically for further details of the “various times”. In response, the second defendant said this:

It can mean either that the first defendant made these statements to the second defendant after the Kuwaiti Investors had invested in the Company. Or it could mean that it was only after the first defendant made these statements to the second defendant that the Kuwaiti Investors invested in the company. The plaintiff’s counsel did not attempt to clarify this ambiguity. Given that the second defendant was giving his evidence in chief orally, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> without an affidavit of evidence in chief, discretion on counsel’s part was no doubt the better part of valour. But the ambiguity which he allowed to remain in the second defendant’s evidence on this crucial point must, in the final analysis, tell against the plaintiffs, as the party on whom the burden of proof rests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, the second defendant’s more detailed account of the first defendant’s statements to him is neutral as between the plaintiffs’ case and the first defendant’s case.

It was friendly talk early on. It was the tone in which he communicated. It was boastful at first, it was as if to convey the impression that, “I have enough that if an investor is being disruptive or if an investor not to my liking, I can simply buy them out and tell them to be on their way.” And that tone changed to almost stressed tone over time, after I joined the company and as the relationship with the Kuwaiti investors frayed, and it appeared his own means were a little constrained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 On another occasion, the second defendant expanded on his evidence of the first defendant’s statements to him in this way:

About May of 2015, May of 2015 was when [the first defendant] had bought out Mr [Gurmeet] Aman Bedi’s convertible note … and at that time there was a discussion---there was a conversation between him and me about him buying out a number of convertible note holders and the conversation that we had at that time in broad terms was that the Kuwaiti investors and Sobers will try and align Aman Bedi and Avtar Gill and they were all trying to collectively pressure me to buy them all out quickly. I want to do it piecemeal and I will do it in the order of nuisance value, so to speak. So the more wealthy and more well-connected an investor was in [the first defendant’s] mind, that was a higher priority to finish sooner and he could manage the other investors later. That was the---that’s an instance in which I recall him saying, “I do need to buy them out” or that, “I will buy them out, but I have to prioritise and manage my resources.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This account of the second defendant’s statement is equally consistent with the first defendant’s case that he made a non-binding offer to buy out the Kuwaiti Investors as personal favour, rather than undertaking any obligation to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Third, I accept the first defendant’s submission that the second defendant is not a wholly impartial witness.

This is two and a half years after the first defendant allegedly made the Representations and two years after the plaintiffs entered into the CNSAs. If the Representations had indeed been made, and if the Representations were indeed so crucial to the plaintiffs’ decision to invest in the Company and to enter into the CNSAs, one would have expected some evidence of the Representations to have surfaced in the parties’ correspondence much earlier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Second, the assertion in this email is entirely self-serving. The email originates from the first plaintiff. Furthermore, the first plaintiff made this assertion at a time when the parties’ relationship had already come under strain. By May 2015, the Kuwaiti Investors had expressed doubts about the first defendant’s US$35m valuation for the Company and his assertion that a Conversion Event had occurred. They were seeking the return of their investment with a 30% premium (see [19]–[24] above). The Kuwaiti Investors had thus already taken a position opposed to that of the Company and of the first defendant. There was therefore every incentive for the first plaintiff to attempt bolster the Kuwaiti Investors’ position in the correspondence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Third, the first plaintiff does not, in this email, say when exactly “in the past” the first defendant allegedly gave this confirmation to the first plaintiff. The first plaintiff’s assertion in this email may therefore be some evidence that the first defendant gave the first plaintiff a confirmation akin to the Investment Exit Representation at some time before May 2015. But it is not evidence of the crucial issue of fact in this action: that the first defendant made the Investment Exit Representation to the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">before</span> the plaintiffs entered into the CNSAs in May 2013. Indeed, it could be said that the first plaintiff’s failure in this email to make any specific reference to the Representations or the plaintiffs’ reliance on them supports the first defendant’s defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Fourth, there is nothing in this email which talks about the source of the funds to be paid to the plaintiffs. The first plaintiff’s statement in this email that the first defendant “will issue a cheque for principle [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and 30%” is equally consistent with the first defendant causing the Company to redeem the Kuwaiti Investors’ loans with a 30% premium out of its own funds as it is with the first defendant buying out the Kuwaiti Investors personally and paying them a 30% premium out of his own funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiffs make much of the fact that the first defendant failed to reject the first plaintiff’s assertion in this email.

</div>
</div> But I do not think that this failure is significant for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 First, the response to this email on 24 May 2015 amounts to an implicit rejection of the first plaintiff’s assertion. The response came from the second defendant to the first plaintiff. It shows that the proposal under discussion at that time was not any payment by the first defendant to the Kuwaiti Investors out of his own funds amounting to 130% of their investment in the Company. Instead, the proposal was that the Kuwaiti Investors exit their investment by converting their loans at 130% into shares and then selling those shares either to the Company’s existing shareholders or to outside shareholders in accordance with the pre-emption provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association.

</div> In that exchange, Mr Sobers Sethi asked what would happen if the Kuwaiti Investors’ loans were converted into shares but the shares could then not be sold. Mr Avtar Gill said that he and his wife, Ms Kuldip Gill, were concentrating on preparations for what must have been a child’s wedding and would not look at this issue until July 2015:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Kuldip and I are not making any decisions as of now.

If this is the case, we have our clients’ express instructions to commence legal proceedings against the Company, its directors and senior management, including but not limited to Mr. Sandeep Singh Bhatia and Mr. Abhishek Singh, and seek the relevant remedies, including but not limited to, the repurchase of their interests in the notes and/or conversion shares based on your own declared valuation of US$35 million or for the Company to be wound up or an action to require the Company to bring an action against its directors for misconduct and mismanagement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Three points are significant about this letter before action. First, the dispute which is the subject-matter of the letter is a dispute between the plaintiffs and the Company, not with the first defendant personally. That is why the letter is addressed to the Company and merely marked for the first defendant’s attention (along with the second defendant) rather than being addressed directly to the first defendant. That is also why the reference to the first defendant in the letter’s conclusion is a reference to him in his capacity as one of the “officers” and the “directors and senior management” of the Company rather than in his personal capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Second, the nature of the dispute which is the subject matter of this letter has nothing whatsoever to do with any misrepresentations of any kind, whether by the first defendant personally or even by the Company, let alone misrepresentations which preceded and induced the plaintiffs’ investment and entry into the CNSAs, let alone misrepresentations by the first defendant in his personal capacity which had that effect. It appears from the conclusion to the letter that the plaintiffs at that time considered that they had a right to commence proceedings against the Company and its directors for relief from minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) or to seek leave to bring a statutory derivative action in the Company’s name under s 216A of the Companies Act, with the defendants joined to that litigation as necessary and proper parties and not as direct wrongdoers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Third, the concluding paragraph makes clear that the remedy which the plaintiffs intended then to seek from the courts if their concerns were not addressed is an order for the “repurchase” of their interests in the CNSAs or the resulting conversion shares at the first defendant’s disputed valuation of US$35m. That can only be an order against the Company, as the addressee of the letter. And nothing in the preceding seven paragraphs of the letter suggests that there was, at that time, any contractual or other right, primary or secondary, already vested in the plaintiffs to have the Company “repurchase” those interests at any valuation. The foreshadowed relief in the letter’s conclusion is therefore inconsistent with both: (a) a right vested in the plaintiffs at the time of this letter to have their interests under the CNSAs or the resulting conversion shares bought out by any person; and (b) a right of any kind vested in the plaintiffs at the time of this letter against the first defendant personally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The Company responded to the letter initially directly through the second defendant

It is also true that the amounts in question are not substantial, both in the context of the plaintiffs’ wealth and in the nature of investments in a friends and family round. Despite that, if the first defendant had indeed made the Representations and if they were indeed so critical to the plaintiffs’ decision to invest in the Company and to enter into the CNSAs, I consider it contrary to the inherent probabilities that seasoned and hard-headed businessmen like the plaintiffs would have allowed representations as favourable to them as the Representations to remain completely undocumented. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The first plaintiff explained his conduct on the basis that he trusted the first defendant because they were good friends,

I consider it far more likely that seasoned and hard-headed businessmen, even if dealing with friends and with relatively small sums, would have recorded the fact that the Representations were made and their content in writing in some way, even if only to evidence them after entering into the CNSAs. After all, businessmen know that when the time comes to rely on oral representations, even ones made by a friend, the representor has every incentive to deny having made them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In summary, my view is that proceeding entirely on trust in these circumstances, even with a friend and even given the relatively small amount invested, is inconsistent with the plaintiffs’ sophistication and experience.

</div> These buyouts occurred after the 5 June 2015 Meeting. The plaintiffs’ case is that, during or after the 5 June 2015 Meeting, the first defendant entered into an oral contract to buy out the Kuwaiti Investors at 130% of their investments. In the circumstances, if the buyouts for Mr Albader and Mr Alqabandi evidence anything, they evidence the plaintiffs’ case that the first defendant entered into a contract at the 5 June 2015 Meeting to buy out the Kuwaiti Investors

So Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi’s buyout cannot be connected to anything which the first defendant said or did at the 5 June 2015 Meeting.

Plaintiff’s counsel was able to demonstrate easily that this was false by putting two specific emails from January 2015 to the first defendant showing that he had indeed used those precise numbers on at least two occasions.

However, when the first defendant was cross-examined on this statement at trial, he gave contradictory and unsatisfactory answers in an effort to explain evidence which suggested that he paid that capital in to the Company, not upon incorporation, but only in December 2013, long after incorporation and well after the funds from the friends and family round had come in.

In March 2015, he sent by email several documents to the Kuwaiti Investors which he said in the covering email justified his valuation and which, on their face, appeared to do so. But when asked at trial to explain how precisely those documents justified his valuation, the first defendant conceded that the attachments were not the basis on which he valued the company at US$35m. He was then unable to justify the figure. The second defendant also testified that he considered the valuation to be too aggressive and unsupported by the Company’s performance figures and prospects at that time.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Defendant’s counsel’s concession is correctly made. It appears from the defendants’ evidence that what they meant by the label “without prejudice” was not that the discussions were cloaked with a privilege from compulsory disclosure in litigation, whether pre-trial or at trial. Instead, what they simply meant was to reserve the parties’ right to resile from positions taken at the meeting and to withdraw admissions made at the meeting. The phrase “without prejudice” is commonly misused in this way, even by lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first defendant offered to buy out the investors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The first defendant alleges in his email of 10 June 2015 that the Draft Minutes contain inaccuracies and omissions. But, apart from the amended and annotated Minutes which the first defendant now accepts he did not send contemporaneously to the plaintiffs (see [133] above), the first defendant has never deigned to identify any specific inaccuracies or omissions, whether contemporaneously in June 2015 or in the course of his evidence at trial. Furthermore, his counsel was unable even at the end of trial, in the course of his of oral closing submissions, to identify any specific inaccuracies or omissions in the Draft Minutes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I therefore take the Draft Minutes as a broadly accurate record of the discussions at the 5 June 2015 Meeting, even after making the necessary allowances for the inevitable self-serving shading that one would expect to find in a document of this nature, prepared as it was by only one party to a dispute after the battle lines in the dispute had been drawn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Reading the Draft Minutes in the context of the first defendant’s response dated 10 June 2015, the entire correspondence in Phase 3 and the first defendant’s subsequent conduct, I find that the first defendant did, at the 5 June 2015 Meeting, offer to buy each Kuwaiti Investor out at 130% of his investment after he had converted his loan into shares in the Company. But that does not get the plaintiffs home on the Repayment Contract Claim. An offer is not, in itself, a contract. Even a promise is not, in itself, a contract. Amongst other things, both an intention to create legal relations and consideration must accompany an offer or a promise to give rise to a contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I therefore turn now to consider the first defendant’s defences that the parties had no intention to create legal relations at the 5 June 2015 meeting and that the Kuwaiti Investors supplied no consideration for the Repayment Contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No intention to create legal relations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The test of whether parties intended to create legal relations is objective: <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [40]. It is presumed that parties who enter into agreements in a business or commercial context do<span class="font-italic"> </span>intend to create legal relations. The converse presumption operates in a social or domestic context (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>”) at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The difficulty, of course, is that the plaintiffs and the first defendant had both a business relationship and a social relationship. The case of <span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong and another v Chew Hua Seng </span>[2020] SGHC 39 (“<span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong</span>”) is instructive on the effect of the approach when the contexts overlap in this way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In <span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong</span>, a shareholder of a company and the company’s founder and chief executive officer were also friends. The friends had a disagreement about how the company should be run. They met to discuss the way forward for the shareholder’s investment in the company. As a result of their meeting, they signed a handwritten note which provided that the founder was to procure a buyer for the shareholder’s shares in the company. The founder failed to do so. The shareholder sued the founder on the handwritten note, claiming that it amounted to a contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Lee Seiu Kin J rejected the shareholder’s claim. In finding that the parties had no intention to create legal relations, Lee J made the following findings and observations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The meeting between the parties was not conducted in a purely business context. Their discussion was not convened in a formal setting or in the presence of legal advisors. Instead, they met outside business hours at the house of the shareholder’s sister, with family members in attendance. This would have been “an unlikely setting in which to negotiate a contractual … agreement”: at [41].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Both parties were given an indication that the purpose of the meeting was to each party to hear the other out in an informal setting: at [42].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The handwritten note was drafted by a lay person and could not have been intended by the parties to carry legal effect. As commercial men, the parties would have instructed lawyers to draft a legal document to capture their obligations correctly: at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Lee J’s observations are pertinent to the present case. Much like the meeting in <span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong</span>, the first plaintiff and the first defendant were friends whose friendship had come under strain. The 5 June 2015 Meeting was convened for the first plaintiff and the first defendant to hear each other out.

</div> The Meeting was held in the absence of legal representatives. It was held in a domestic setting rather than a business setting. There were friends and family members in attendance who were not parties to the underlying business transaction between the Kuwaiti Investors and the Company, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>Mr Sobers, Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi and Ms Simran Bedi. In my view, the parties did not manifest objectively an intention to create legal relations when they attended the 5 June 2015 Meeting in these circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I turn to the form of the alleged agreement. In <span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong</span>, the alleged agreement was reduced to writing, albeit in the form of a handwritten note drafted on the spot by lay people. By contrast, the plaintiffs’ case is that the Repayment Contract is an entirely oral contract concluded at the 5 June 2015 Meeting. I note Lee J’s observation that businessmen ordinarily instruct lawyers to document their obligations accurately, and do not base their legally binding commitments on notes drafted by lay people. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 There is evidence in this case that the first defendant relied on the second defendant for that very purpose. Indeed, it is common ground that the first defendant sought the assistance of second defendant (as the Company’s General Counsel) to draft the CNSAs in 2013.

But that is because Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi made no such assertion in his covering email. Nor did the Draft Minutes themselves purport to record a contract between the first defendant and the plaintiffs. In fact, Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi’s request to the first defendant to let him know if anything needed to be added to the Draft Minutes and his reference to “a final contract” being drafted from the Draft Minutes all support the first defendant’s case that the parties had no intention to create legal relations at the 5 June 2015 Meeting.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The meaning of “agree”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The plaintiffs’ submissions place great weight on the parties’ use of the verb “agree” and its cognate expressions – especially the noun “agreement” – in their correspondence. The plaintiffs place similar weight on verbs such as “promise” and “confirm”. The submission is that the use of these words amount to an admission or acknowledgement by the first defendant that he considered – contemporaneously with the 5 June 2015 Meeting and while he was buying out Mr Alqabandi and Mr Albader and preparing to buy out the plaintiffs – that he had indeed entered into a binding contract to do so at the 5 June 2015 Meeting.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I do not accept this submission. The verb “agree” and the noun “agreement” have very different meanings as ordinary words of the English language and in legal usage. As an ordinary word of the English language, the word “agree” simply means to have the same opinion or view as another person or to concur with that person. The noun “agreement” thus means simply an accordance between two more persons in opinion or feeling. In legal usage, however, the verb “agree” and the noun “agreement” have dual meanings. They bear their usual meaning as ordinary words of the English language. But they also used loosely as a synonym for “contract”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I do not accept that the parties used the word “agree” or “agreement” as a synonym for “contract” in their correspondence, let alone “promise” or “confirm”. That is simply not how lay people use these words. I therefore give no weight to these words as carrying any legal effect or expressly a legal conclusion where they appear in the correspondence between the parties. I consider the use of these words – and indeed, all of the statements by the first defendant of his intent to buy out the Kuwaiti Investors in this correspondence – to be more consistent with the first defendant’s defence that, at the 5 June 2015 Meeting, he concurred with the plaintiffs’ opinion on the way forward than with the plaintiffs’ case that these words were intended to and did give rise to a contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I therefore do not find it surprising that the first defendant did not deny that he was under a legal obligation to buy out the Kuwaiti Investors in this correspondence. The plaintiffs did not suggest at any time that the first defendant was under any such obligation. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not follow up on their suggestion (through Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi’s email in June 2015 to which the Minutes were attached (see [144] above)) that the parties’ “agreement” (used as an ordinary word of the English language) be formalised as a contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 For all these reasons, I find that the first defendant and the plaintiffs had no intention to create legal relations in their discussions at the 5 June 2015 Meeting. That suffices in itself to dismiss the Repayment Contract Claim. But I also consider that the plaintiffs provided no consideration for the Repayment Contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The plaintiffs’ case, as pleaded in their reply, is that the plaintiffs provided a variety of consideration for the Repayment Contract including by forbearing to sue him on the Representations:

To forbear from suing simply means to refrain from suing. The plaintiffs’ forbearance to sue the first defendant on the Representations simply means that the plaintiffs will refrain from suing the first defendant on the Representations while the forbearance is in place. The practical effect is that, during the period of forbearance, the first defendant need fear no legal consequences for (on the plaintiffs’ case) having fraudulently made the Representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Tellingly, the plaintiffs argue in their closing submissions that:

</div> Accordingly, despite the terms of the plaintiffs’ reply, it is more accurate to say that the plaintiffs’ case is that the consideration (if any) for the Repayment Contract moved from the Kuwaiti Investors as a group to the first defendant rather than only from the plaintiffs to the first defendant. Therefore, the central question that I must resolve is whether the Kuwaiti Investors furnished consideration for the Repayment Contract by forbearing to sue the first defendant on the Representations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I accept, of course, that a forbearance to sue is capable in principle of constituting consideration for a contract (<span class="font-italic">Currie v Misa </span>(1875) LR 10 Ex 153 at 162, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lush J) provided that: (a) there are reasonable grounds for the underlying claim; and (b) the claimant honestly believes that the postponed claim has a fair chance of success (<span class="font-italic">Callisher v Bischoffsheim </span>(1870) LR 5 QB 449 at 451–452, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Cockburn CJ). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 It is not, however, enough for a promisee simply to forbear to sue a defaulting promisor for that forbearance to constitute consideration for a fresh promise from the promisor. The element of bargain which lies at the root of the doctrine of consideration makes it necessary for the promisor to <span class="font-italic">request</span> the consideration as the price of the promise: <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [82]. Applying that principle to the facts of this case, if the first defendant volunteered a promise to buy the Kuwait Investors out at 130% of their investments but did not request anything in exchange for the promise, and if the Kuwaiti Investors thereafter decided unilaterally to refrain from suing the first defendant because of his volunteered promise, their forbearance to sue is not the price of the first defendant’s promise and does not constitute consideration for the promise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 For three reasons, I am satisfied that the first defendant did not ask the Kuwaiti Investors to forbear from suing him on the Representations in exchange for his offer to buy out the Kuwaiti Investors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 First, there is no objective evidence that the first defendant asked the Kuwaiti Investors to forbear from suing him on the Representations. I take the plaintiffs’ case at its highest and assume that the Draft Minutes accurately record the discussions at the 5 June 2015 Meeting. There is no hint in the Draft Minutes that the Kuwaiti Investors intended to sue the first defendant on the Representations at or around 5 June 2015.

</div>
</div> I have two difficulties with this evidence. First, the second defendant did not make it clear whether the first defendant feared the Kuwaiti Investors suing him on a gratuitous promise which he made at the 5 June 2015 Meeting or on the Representations. Only a forbearance to sue the first defendant <span class="font-italic">on the</span> <span class="font-italic">Representations</span> can constitute good consideration for the Repayment Contract. Forbearance to sue on a gratuitous promise made at the 5 June 2015 Meeting obviously cannot constitute consideration to turn that promise itself into a contract. A contract cannot pull itself up by its own bootstraps. Second, even if the first defendant was indeed afraid that the Kuwaiti Investors would sue him <span class="font-italic">on the Representations</span>, it remains the case that the first defendant must then act on that fear by asking the Kuwaiti Investors to forbear from doing so in exchange for his offer for the forbearance to constitute consideration. Once again, there is no evidence of any such request. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I now consider the first plaintiff’s evidence. He testified that, if he had known that the first defendant’s position was that the first defendant did not enter into any binding agreement at the 5 June 2015 Meeting, the first plaintiff would have commenced suit immediately.

</div> I have two difficulties with this evidence. First, it is not clear <span class="font-italic">against whom </span>the first plaintiff would have commenced suit: whether it would have been<span class="font-italic"> </span>the first defendant or the Company. Only proceedings against the former are relevant, given that the plaintiffs’ plea is that the consideration for the Repayment Agreement was the Kuwaiti Investors’ forbearance to sue the <span class="font-italic">first defendant</span>. However, the only evidence of any intention by the plaintiffs to commence suit comes from the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter before action. For the reasons I have already given, that foreshadows a quite different suit against the Company, either under s 216 or s 216A of the Companies Act, with the two defendants joined in their capacity as the Company’s officers and management. In any event, I do not see how the first plaintiff’s evidence of <span class="font-italic">his own</span> state of mind is evidence that the <span class="font-italic">first defendant</span> asked the Kuwaiti Investors for a forbearance to sue him on the Representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Accordingly, I find that the first defendant did not ask the Kuwaiti Investors to forbear suing him on the Representations in exchange for his offer to buy them out. The Repayment Contract is unsupported by consideration. The Repayment Contract Claim fails on this ground also.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first defendant’s defence is not an afterthought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The plaintiffs submit that the first defendant’s defence to the Repayment Contract should be given little weight because it is an afterthought. At the core of this submission is the allegation that the first defendant’s 6 December 2015 email amounts to a sudden change in the first defendant’s position on a basis which the second defendant contrived for him at his request in December 2015. I reject this submission. In my view, the second defendant’s evidence does not support this submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 It is true that the second defendant drafted the first defendant’s 6 December 2015 email for him at his request and on his instructions.

</div> The second defendant’s evidence is that, around this time, the first defendant learned that the first plaintiff was considering legal action against him. So, according to the second defendant, the first defendant wanted a legal basis to get out of the promise he had made at the 5 June 2015 Meeting. He therefore asked the second defendant, being legally trained, to draft an email for him setting out that legal basis.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 But the plaintiffs’ submission that the position which the second defendant drafted for the first defendant in this email is contrived reads far too much into the second defendant’s evidence. The second defendant’s evidence was actually as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Okay. What did [the first defendant] tell you about what the contents of the email should cover?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: He essentially wanted to have it [<span class="font-italic">sc.</span> an] out from having to do the buyouts that he had ostensibly promised [the plaintiffs].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: What do you mean “have an out”?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Have a way to have an option not to do them.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q:  So he wanted an option to not do them and how would this email achieve that purpose?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Well, Sir, when [the first defendant] had shown me the email … where [the first plaintiff] was discussing legal action apparently with a lawyer, at that point in time, I had actually made the suggestion to [the first defendant], I had asked him an open question, bearing in mind at the time that the Kuwaiti investors were painted as villains and disruptive. I had asked him, “Did you always promise to buy them out or was it something like a non-binding favour?” And he picked up on that suggestion and said it was on---“It was always a non- binding favour and I’ve actually promised to buy them out.” So I said, “Well, then you should just make that position clear.” And the result, the culmination of that was the email that was sent on December 6th.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q:  Okay, so I want to be very clear on this. You just used the words “non-binding favour”, okay. Before this---before you had drafted this email, okay, had [the first defendant] told you that anything he had said in the past was a non-binding favour?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: No, Sir, not in those terms, no.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: … “Was always and only ever extended in the personal capacity on the basis of a personal favour that I’ll try and do based on my own financial in light of circumstances.” Now what I need to ask you is these words, or rather the meaning behind these words, were they communicated by Mr Bobby Bhatia to you, or were you the one who drafted words containing this meaning?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Latter, Sir.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Latter.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Latter---essentially, Mr Bhatia’s ask of me was it was always a non-binding favour, it was never an obligation. Craft me an email which gets that point across effectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 If anything, the second defendant’s evidence in fact supports the first defendant’s case. I make three points about this passage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 First, going by the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letters before action sent just over a month after this email (see [107]–[109] above), the legal action which the first plaintiff was contemplating was not an action against the first defendant for breach of a personal obligation owed to the plaintiffs. Instead, the contemplated action was against the Company, with the two defendants joined in their capacity as officers and management of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Second, even if the first plaintiff was indeed contemplating action against the first defendant personally, there is nothing in the second defendant’s evidence which establishes that the first defendant’s true position, at the time he instructed the second defendant to draft this email, was that he had undertaken a legal obligation to the Kuwaiti Investors at the 5 June 2015 Meeting. The second defendant’s evidence is more consistent in my view with the first defendant having made an offer to the Kuwaiti Investors at that meeting as a non-binding personal favour and then finding the Kuwaiti Investors determined to treat his non-binding offer as a binding contract. An offer is not in itself a contract any more than an agreement (in the ordinary sense of the word) or a promise is in itself a contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Finally, the second defendant’s evidence falls far short of establishing that the first defendant asked the second defendant to contrive a legal defence for him contrary to the facts. In my view, his evidence establishes quite the opposite. It appears to me that the second defendant did no more for the first defendant in drafting this email than a competent and ethical lawyer would do for a client: frame the most plausible legal argument which is consistent with the truth in order to advance the client’s interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 It is therefore not to the point for the plaintiffs to point out that the first defendant’s counsel failed to cross-examine the second defendant on this evidence.
