</div>
</div> The third defendant subsequently applied to enforce the plaintiff’s undertaking, in respect of the losses it allegedly suffered as mentioned at [5]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments and issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The sole issue before the court was whether to immediately allow or dismiss the application to enforce the plaintiff’s undertaking, or whether to defer that question until the Estonian proceedings had been disposed of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The third defendant’s position was that the undertaking should be enforced immediately because it was clear that the interim injunction was wrongly granted, as evinced by the fact that the Estonian injunction had been narrowed in scope, and that HC/OS 1050/2021 had been struck out without any objection by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On the other hand, the plaintiff’s position was that the court should decline to enforce her undertaking. This was because the grant of the interim injunction could not be said to have been wrongly granted, as the Estonian proceedings were still ongoing. In any case, even if it was wrongly granted, the reasonableness of her conduct, and the lack of any evidence that the interim injunction had caused loss to the third defendant, nonetheless made it unjust and inequitable for her to be held to it. Alternatively, it should be held in abeyance until the Estonian proceedings were fully resolved. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the outset, the relevant principles governing the enforcement of an undertaking as to damages are not controversial. The court has the ultimate discretion to determine whether the undertaking should be enforced. This discretion must be exercised with reference to all factors in the case, and the court must be satisfied that the injunction was wrongly granted and that there are no special circumstances militating against the enforcement of the undertaking (<span class="font-italic">Neptune Capital Group Ltd and others v Sunmax </span><span class="font-italic">Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1177 at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The enforcement of the undertaking should not be immediately dismissed </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It could not be said that the plaintiff’s “reasonableness” constituted special circumstances which justified an immediate refusal to enforce her undertaking. Circumstances which <span class="font-italic">would</span> justify such refusal have been understood to include the conduct of the defendant, a delay in seeking an inquiry as to damages, or situations where the plaintiff acts in the public interest (<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara International BV</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v PT Ayunda Prima Mitra and others and another matter </span>[2016] 2 SLR 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara</span>”) at [27]–[31]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, it does not stand to reason that the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">good</span> conduct may amount to special circumstances justifying the court’s refusal to enforce an undertaking. The default position is that where the plaintiff has lost their claim, this would militate strongly in favour of an order for an inquiry (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [54]). This is consistent with the proposition that the entitlement of the restrained party to obtain, in appropriate circumstances, an award of damages pursuant to an undertaking as to damages is an equitable right (<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara </span>at [24]). The fact that the party who gave the undertaking did not behave unreasonably is not a special circumstance which can displace this default position – indeed, this is no more than what the court expects of every litigant appearing before it and cannot justify relieving the litigant of something which he or she has undertaken to do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The fact that the third defendant allegedly did not provide “cogent and credible evidence” of the losses they suffered as a result of the interim injunction is also no basis to decline granting an order for an inquiry as to damages. An application for enforcement of an undertaking as to damages proceeds in two stages – the court first decides whether the undertaking should be enforced and, only if it finds in the affirmative, proceeds to consider the measure and quantum of damages (<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara </span>at [34]). The defendant could not be faulted for not adducing evidence directed towards the latter question when the proceedings were concerned with the former. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nevertheless, the enforcement of the undertaking should not be immediately granted </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 However, it was also not appropriate to immediately order an inquiry as to damages, for the simple reason that, at this juncture, it could not be said that the injunction was wrongly granted. The fact that the plaintiff did not object to the striking out of HC/OS 1050/2021 did not, without more, mean that the interim injunction was wrongly granted. As the plaintiff’s counsel suggested during the hearing, the plaintiff’s decision not to object might have been made because she lacked the funds to conduct two actions in separate countries at the same time, and it cannot be taken as an indication of the merits of the case.

The question of whether an undertaking in damages should be enforced is a separate question from whether an injunction order should be discharged or continued, and it is incorrect to assume that the discharge of an injunction at the interlocutory stage must mean that it was wrongly obtained in the first place (<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara </span>at [25]; <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent Logistics Pte Ltd and another v Singapore Agro Agricultural Pte Ltd and others</span> [2014] 4 SLR 1208 (“<span class="font-italic">SH Cogent</span>”) at [175]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The enforcement of the plaintiff’s undertaking should be held over until the determination of the Estonian proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In view of the foregoing and given that the interim injunction was ultimately obtained in support of the Estonian proceedings, the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society (formerly Portsmouth Building Society) v Ricketts </span>[1993] 1 WLR 1545 (“<span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">heltenham</span>”) was instructive. There, the court found that that the question of the enforcement of an undertaking as to damages, given in connection with an injunction, was best reserved to the trial judge to determine after the merits of the claim were decided. In coming to this conclusion, Peter Gibson LJ placed great emphasis on the fact that the plaintiffs’ main claim was in fraud. If they were proven right on the merits at trial, and the defendants did indeed prove to be fraudsters, then that might suggest that there was a real risk that they would have attempted to defeat the judgment in precisely the manner which the injunctions had been sought to guard against. This being the case, the most prudent course would be to determine whether the undertaking should be enforced only “at the conclusion of the trial when all the facts are known” (<span class="font-italic">Cheltenham </span>at 1560).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In this case, it should be borne in mind that the Estonian proceedings were likewise founded on claims of fraud. If it is found in the Estonian proceedings that there is some merit to this claim, then it would in retrospect not be unreasonable to believe that the first defendant might have taken advantage of her control over the third defendant to transfer its assets to other entities which did not form part of deceased’s estate. While this would not undermine the plaintiff’s legal rights in the estate, it would certainly impair the value of that share – indeed, there is nothing in the Estonian appellate court’s decision on 7 January 2022 to suggest that the shares in the third defendant were not part of the deceased’s estate, with its use of the phrase “individual objects belonging to the estate”

</div> in respect of those shares. In fact, the use of this phrase suggested quite the opposite. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As those proceedings had not yet concluded, there was little to be lost, and less still that could not have been compensated by damages or costs, from waiting until the court is fully apprised of the circumstances of the case. This is so that it may come to a more informed conclusion on whether the plaintiff’s undertaking should be enforced. This was in my view the most just and equitable way forward, in view of the ongoing proceedings and the ultimate purpose for which the interim injunction was sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Accordingly, the plaintiff’s undertaking as to damages was ordered to be held over until the Estonian proceedings were resolved. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kyle Gabriel Peters, Chua Ze Xuan and Ramachandran Doraisamy Raghunath (PDLegal LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Chuan Thye SC, Kee Lay Lian, Kok Chee Yeong Jared and Yvette Tay Yu Wei (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
