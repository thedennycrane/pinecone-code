<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Death and taxes, it is said, are the only
                    certainties in this world. But only one of them is painless on impact. This case
                    is about the other. It is an appeal by one Lai Ling Wan @ Lily Lai (“the
                    Appellant”) against an assessment of stamp duty that was performed by the
                    Commissioner of Stamp Duties (“the Commissioner”). The Appellant
                    purchased 83 units in a Tower 1A of a development called “Reflections at
                    Keppel Bay” (“the Development”) from Keppel Bay Pte Ltd
                    (“the Developer”). 83 sale and purchase agreements (“the 83
                    sale contracts”) were issued by the Developer and executed by the
                    Appellant. This court was asked to determine the stamp duty which is payable
                    arising from the purchase of the 83 units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The material provision relating to the stamp
                    duty payable is s 22(1) of the Stamp Duties Act (Cap 312, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”). It states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every contract or agreement for the sale of –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(<em>a</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">any equitable estate
                            or interest in any property; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(<em>b</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">any estate or
                            interest in any property …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall be charged with the same ad valorem duty, payable by the purchaser,
                        as if it were an actual conveyance on sale of the estate, interest or
                        property contracted or agreed to be sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant intended to stamp each of the 83 sale contracts as
                    individual contracts, at the <em>ad valorem</em> rates set
                    out in article no 3(<em>a</em>) of the First Schedule
                    of the Act. The Commissioner was of the view that the 83 sale contracts cannot
                    be stamped individually and that stamp duty has to be paid on the basis that all
                    83 units were transferred to her under a single instrument of transfer at the
                    aggregate price of $226,472,460. That meant that the appellant had to pay a
                    higher amount in stamp duty because stamp duty is calculated at a graduated
                    rate, and the Appellant would have saved $5,400 for each instrument of transfer
                    and be entitled to a refund of $442,680 if her position is correct. The full
                    amount as calculated by the Commissioner had already been paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The case stated by the Commissioner pursuant to
                    s 40 of the Act expressed the Commissioner’s ground, which is that
                    there was only one contract for the sale of all 83 units. At the appeal, the
                    Commissioner reiterated this ground. Prior to the appeal, however, the
                    Commissioner had relied upon two other grounds to support his position. These
                    can be found in the letters the Commissioner had written to the Appellant. The
                    relevant portions of those letters are reproduced in the case stated. It is
                    unclear whether these two other grounds, which are the “larger
                    transaction” and the “block basis” arguments had been
                    abandoned on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The material background facts are as follows. On
                    or around 4 May 2007, the Appellant visited the Development’s
                    show-flats with her lawyer, Lim Seow Leng (“Lim”). They were
                    attended to by an associate sales director from CB Richard Ellis (Pte) Ltd
                    (“CBRE”), one Gabriel Tang (“Tang”). Tang arranged
                    for the Appellant to meet CBRE’s Leong Boon Hoe (“Leong”)
                    and Joseph Tan (“Tan”) after she expressed interest in purchasing
                    units in the Development. The Appellant met Leong and Tan on 7 May 2007 and
                    Leong advised the Appellant to sign a letter of intent for the purposes of
                    commencing negotiations. The Appellant signed the letter of intent, dated
                    7 May 2007 (“the 7 May letter”) and addressed it to
                    Keppel Land International Limited (“Keppel Land”). Keppel Land was
                    marketing the Development for the Developer. The relevant portion of the
                    7 May letter stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant then appointed Lim under a power of attorney to liaise
                    with CBRE and the Developer on her behalf, and Lim commenced discussions with
                    them. Besides the units in Tower 1A, the Developer also offered the Appellant
                    units in other towers. After considering the offer, the Appellant decided to
                    purchase only 83 strata lots comprising all the units in Tower 1A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       During these discussions, the Developer raised
                    for the first time, an additional condition to the sale of the 83 units, namely,
                    that the Appellant undertakes not to offer any units in Tower 1A for sale within
                    six months from the date of exercising the options to purchase. The

                    from the date of the Appellant’s exercise of the options to purchase. On
                    9 July 2007, the Appellant issued a single cashier’s order and paid
                    the balance 15% purchase price to the Developer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The issue before me was whether, as between the
                    Appellant and the Developer (“the Parties”), they had entered into
                    one contract for the sale of 83 units or 83 separate contracts for the sale of
                    one unit under each contract. The evidence, documentary or otherwise concerning
                    the negotiations between the parties does not show that the parties intended the
                    Appellant to purchase a collective interest. The 7 May letter was not an
                    enforceable contract between the Parties. It recorded an expression of the
                    Appellant’s interest to the Developer to purchase units in the
                    Development. As a matter of construction, the 7 May letter was not an offer
                    made by the Appellant to purchase the 83 units. The language used was tentative
                    and equivocal, and merely expressed the Appellant’s keenness to purchase.
                    Even if the 7 May letter constituted an offer to buy the 83 units as one
                    collective interest from the Developer, the evidence showed that the Developer
                    did not accept it. The Developer rejected it when it made a counter offer and
                    proposed an additional condition, namely, that the Appellant undertakes not to
                    dispose of any of the units in Tower 1A within six months of the date of
                    exercising the options to purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The 10 May 2007 letter which followed
                    showed that the Parties had agreed upon the essential terms, namely, the
                    identity of the property, the parties and the purchase price. However, it was
                    prefaced with the phrase “subject to contract”, an expression
                    readily understood by lawyers and non-lawyers alike to mean that until a formal
                    written agreement is drawn and executed between the parties, there would be no
                    binding contract between them: <em>Compaq Computer Asia Pte Ltd v
                        Computer Interface (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 316.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Of course, in exceptional circumstances the
                    expression “subject to contract” may not prevent a contract from
                    arising, but there were no such exceptional circumstances here, unlike the
                    circumstances in <em>SM Integrated Transware Pte Ltd v Schenker
                        Singapore (Pte) Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 651
                        (“<em>SM Integrated</em>”), a case which
                    the Commissioner relied upon. <em>SM Integrated</em> is
                    distinguishable from the present case. The issue in <em>SM
                        Integrated Transware</em> was whether the parties had been negotiating
                    on a “subject to contract” basis. The only document that bore that
                    expression there was a letter of intent sent out at a very early stage of
                    negotiations. The trial judge found that the letter was merely meant to evidence
                    interest in the negotiations and was ignored once negotiations were underway. On
                    an objective interpretation, neither party had relied on the qualification. It
                    thus did not prevent a contract from arising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the present case, the Parties had intended
                    that enforceable rights in relation to sale and purchase of the 83 units would
                    arise only from the terms contained in the individual options to purchase which
                    were issued shortly after the 10 May letter. This understanding is
                    unequivocally reflected in a letter from the Developer’s solicitors in
                    reply to the Commissioner who had asked the Developer, “Whether the
                    purchaser can choose not to buy any of the units following the granting of the
                    Option to Purchase”. The Developer’s solicitors wrote
                    —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The sale is premised on 83 separate Options to Purchase in the prescribed
                        format being issued to the purchaser. As such, the purchaser can choose not
                        to exercise any of the Options to Purchase granted by the Developers and
                        thus not to proceed with the purchase of these units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Finally, the Commissioner relied upon
                        <em>UOL Development (Novena) Pte Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp
                        Duties</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 126 (“<em>UOL Development</em>”). In <em>UOL
                        Development</em>, a developer tendered for the purchase of 53
                    properties from their registered proprietors. After the developer’s tender
                    was accepted, their solicitors requested the registered proprietors’
                    solicitors to forward 53 letters of acceptance. For the purposes of assessment
                    of the payable stamp duty, the similar question arose as to whether there
                    existed only one contract for the collective sale of the properties or 53
                    separate contracts. The High Court held that it was the former. <em>UOL Development</em> is, however, different from the present
                    case in two material respects. First, the registered proprietors’ had
                    intended to sell collectively in order to fetch a higher price. The registered
                    proprietors’ invitation to tender was also construed objectively as an
                    offer made by them to sell a collective interest. This in turn necessarily meant
                    that the purchaser intended to purchase a collective interest. There was also a
                    finding of fact that the developer knew it had purchased the properties as a
                    collective interest. Secondly, s 33A of the Act was relied upon in
                        <em>UOL Development</em>. Section 33A(1) of the
                    Act authorises the state to alter the intended tax treatment of an arrangement
                    between two contracting parties. The general effect of s 33A of the Act was to
                    give the Commissioner the right to disregard or vary arrangements as he thinks
                    appropriate, which purpose or effect was to reduce or avoid tax liabilities,
                    without prejudice to the arrangement’s validity as it may have in any
                    other respect. In <em>UOL Development</em>, it was found
                    that the developer’s request to the registered proprietors’
                    solicitors to issue 53 letters of acceptance was unnecessary in the light of the
                    collective invitation to tender. It seemed so clearly an afterthought that was
                    meant to let the developer evade tax liabilities, and not for any legitimate
                    commercial purpose. The Commissioner did not rely on s 33A(1) of the Act in
                    this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In these premises, there were no binding
                    contractual obligations until the 83 sale contracts were executed on 8 June
                    2007. These individual sale and purchase contracts comprised the bargain between
                    the Parties. The objective interpretation of this bargain was that the Developer
                    sold and the Appellant purchased 83 units of the Development as individual
                    strata lots. Their respective rights and liabilities were regulated by each
                    individual sale and purchase contract. The Appellant was therefore entitled to
                    stamp each of the 83 sale contracts as separate and distinct instruments of
                    transfer, being individual contracts for the sale of the respective interest in
                    each unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     That only one caveat was lodged and one
                    cashier’s order used each time to make payment to the Developer did not
                    affect the nature of the bargain that there was to be 83 separate contracts for
                    the sale of one unit under each contract. A caveat does not create a new
                    interest or modify an existing interest in land. The Appellant’s use of
                    one caveat to protect all her 83 separate interests does not in any way prove
                    that only one contract was entered into. Furthermore, given that the number of
                    caveats to lodge was a matter entirely for the Appellant to decide and was
                    outside of the scope of the Parties’ agreement, it could not have had any
                    impact on it. The mode of payment between the Parties is irrelevant to the issue
                    at hand. Contracting parties are free to agree on how they are to pay each other
                    without having it affect other substantive contractual
                obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The thrust of the Commissioner’s case
                    was based on the application of contract law. In contract, however, parties are
                    free to structure their bargain as they wish for mutual benefit, without
                    generally having regard to third-party or public interests. One qualification to
                    the scope of the principle of freedom of contract is that contractual
                    obligations may be unenforceable by one party against the other if they were
                    held to be illegal or contrary to public policy. This is not a case where one of
                    the Parties is attempting to enforce the 83 contracts. The 83 sale contracts
                    were also not illegal or unenforceable. Counsel for the Commissioner attempted
                    to re-characterise the Parties’ bargain by relying on a vague argument
                    based on public policy. This attempt manifested itself in the two grounds
                    mentioned above, namely, that the 83 contracts were essentially one transaction
                    (the “larger transaction” argument) and the purchase of the
                    properties was made on a block basis (the “block basis”
                    argument).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It was not the Commissioner’s case that
                    the Parties’ contracts were structured for the purpose of reducing or
                    avoiding tax liabilities such that s 33A(1) of the Act has to be invoked.
                    There was also no evidence to show that that was one of the parties’
                    purpose or intention. Although the Parties’ bargain had the effect of
                    reducing tax liabilities, the Appellant had offered persuasive and <em>bona fide</em> commercial reasons for structuring the bargain
                    in that manner. The Appellant affirmed in her affidavit that she would not have
                    accepted a single sale and purchase agreement to purchase all the units as a
                    collective interest. A single agreement would have constrained her ability to
                    obtain financing from more than one financial institution. She would also face
                    difficulties in the event of the sub-sale of one or more of the units because
                    the Developer would have to cancel the sale and purchase agreement and re-issue
                    her with fresh sale and purchase agreements. These reasons bring the
                    Appellant’s case within the ambit of s 33A(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Act which states that the section shall not apply to
                    “any arrangement carried out for bona fide commercial reasons and had not
                    as one of its main purpose the avoidance or reduction of
                duty”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Hence, instead of relying on s 33A of the
                    Act, the Commissioner wrote to the Appellant in a letter dated 17 July
                    2008:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the multiple Sale &amp; Purchase Agreements entered between [the
                        Developer] and [the Appellant] are in essence one single transaction. Stamp
                        duty is therefore payable on the total purchase price at which the units
                        were acquired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It suffices to say that the “larger transaction” rule
                    was derived from interpreting the stamp duties legislation of other
                    jurisdictions and is not part of Singapore law. For example, in <em>Attorney-General v Cohen and another</em> [1937]
                    1 KB 478, the purchaser bought from the same vendor six lots of land
                    at a public auction. Separate contracts of sale were entered into in respect of
                    each lot. The English Court of Appeal was required to determine if four of these
                    sale contracts formed “part of a larger transaction or of a series of
                    transactions” under s 73 of the UK Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910. If
                    so, they would be liable to a higher rate of duty. Slesser LJ held that the
                    provision is intended to prevent persons who are in reality conveying a larger
                    interest from escaping their liability to pay the higher rate of duty by
                    dissecting that larger transaction into artificially discrete parts. While the
                    mischief targeted by that provision which lays down the “larger
                    transaction” rule is broadly similar to that envisaged by s 33A(1)
                    of the Act, the provisions are not <em>in pari materia</em>
                    and there are fine but important differences in their operation. For instance,
                    the wording of s 33A(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Act
                    expressly requires some degree of investigation into the parties’
                    commercial motivations whereas the judicially-formulated “larger
                    transaction” rule which is based on interpreting a foreign statute may
                    not require such an investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Commissioner also referred to a circular
                    issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore on 13 March 2008 titled
                    “Stamp duty treatment for properties acquired on an <em>en
                        bloc</em> or block basis” (“the Circular”). It is
                    undisputed that the Circular is not subsidiary legislation. The second and third
                    paragraphs of the Circular stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For properties acquired on enbloc or block basis, stamp duty should be
                        calculated based on the total purchase price. This is because, based on the
                        true nature of the transaction, there is only one single contract for the
                        enbloc or block purchase of the properties. Thus the correct tax treatment
                        would be to regard the purchase of the properties as one single
                        transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even though individual documents may have been prepared for the
                        disposition of the individual properties to the same purchaser, stamp duty
                        should not be paid on the sale price of each individual property to take
                        advantage of the graduated stamp duty tax rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, the Circular does not assist the Commissioner’s
                    case. First, the Circular is irrelevant as a justification for the
                    Commissioner’s position in the present case because it was published after
                    the present case had arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Secondly, the Commissioner cannot rely on its
                    own administrative practice to justify a particular interpretation of the
                    Act’s provisions. What the Commissioner did or is doing as a matter of
                    practice does not in any way inform the issue of whether it is legally entitled
                    to do so: <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 948 at [35].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thirdly, the terms that are used in the
                    Circular – “<em>en bloc</em>” and
                    “block purchase” – are problematic in both senses of the
                    adjective. Neither term is a term of art. The attempt by both parties to this
                    case to define the terms was therefore not helpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Appellant relied on <em>Ng
                        Swee Lang and another v Sassoon Samuel Bernard and others</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 597 at [42] to say that the distinct nature of an <em>en bloc</em> sale is that it is based on a single collective
                    agreement, and not an aggregation of all the individual interests. She then
                    sought to distinguish her case from an <em>en bloc</em>
                    sale; but in my view, <em>Ng Swee Lang</em> did not involve
                    the same considerations, and how it defined the term <em>en
                        bloc</em> was irrelevant for present purposes. That case construed the
                    nature of the sale and purchase agreement for the collective sale of
                    condominiums and flats in Singapore under the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158,
                    1999 Rev Ed). That statute allowed a sufficient number of subsidiary proprietors
                    to sell the collective interest to a purchaser, notwithstanding the existence of
                    some objecting subsidiary proprietors. The term <em>en
                        bloc</em> sale was used merely as a convenient label to describe a
                    sale made under those circumstances which, under the Land Titles (Strata) Act,
                    was construed as a single sale and purchase transaction of the subject property
                    as a whole between the majority owners and the purchaser. I believe that the
                    Appellant felt obliged to provide an opinion on what <em>en
                        bloc</em> meant because the Commissioner had previously invoked the
                    term “block basis” to support his position, and the Appellant thus
                    wrongly, but understandably, treated them to be synonymous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I now turn to the term “block
                    basis”. On 22 August 2008, prior to this appeal, the Appellant had
                    lodged an objection pursuant to s 39A(1) of the Act against the
                    Commissioner’s assessment. The Commissioner then issued a notice on
                    26 April 2010 under s 39A(5) of the Act to set out his grounds for
                    dismissing the objection:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With reference to Section 5 of the Stamp Duties Act, the true nature of
                        the transaction was to acquire the entire Tower 1A in [the Development] on a
                        block basis and hence the duty has to be stamped based on the global
                        purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In this appeal, the Commissioner attempted to
                    clarify the meaning of both terms. Counsel submitted on his behalf that there is
                    a difference between an <em>en bloc</em> and a block sale,
                    and the present case involves the latter. He stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… While the en bloc, or collective sale is well-understood due to
                        the highly-publicised disputes that have been adjudicated in the courts, the
                        term “block purchase” simply refers to the purchase of more
                        than one unit of property in a single contract by a purchaser from a vendor.
                        There is no need for a meeting of minds (consensus id idem) between the
                        purchaser and vendor, such that the purchaser will not proceed with the sale
                        unless the vendor agrees to sell all the property that the purchaser desires
                        to purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This submission cannot succeed because it ignored Loh Yow Khim’s
                    affidavit, affirmed on the Commissioner’s behalf on 6 July 2010,
                    which stated that the issue in the present case is whether there was an
                        “<em>en bloc</em>” sale. This affidavit,
                    affirmed two years after the Circular was published, showed that the
                    Commissioner did not have a consistent view of the two terms from the outset and
                    the ambiguity remains. It thus showed that a meaningful difference between them
                    in this context was unlikely to be found. This was not surprising since they are
                    not terms of art and, according to <em>The Chambers
                        Dictionary</em> (Chambers Harrup Publishers, 11th Ed, 2008), <em>en bloc</em> simply means “as one unit or
                    wholesale” in French.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Fourthly, the Circular will be inconsistent
                    with the Act if we assume that a sale on a block basis means what counsel
                    submitted on behalf of the Commissioner in this case. The Circular will deem all
                    properties acquired on a block basis to be made under a single contract since
                    that will always be “the true nature of the transaction”. Not only
                    does it beg the question, it is contrary to s 33A(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Act which provides that the tax treatment must be
                    applied with reference to the purpose behind the arrangement. Hence, there
                    cannot be a uniform treatment of block purchases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For the reasons above, I find in favour of the
                    Appellant. Her appeal is allowed with costs to be taxed if not
                agreed.</p>
