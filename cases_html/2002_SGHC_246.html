<em>Cur Adv Vult</em></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        The plaintiffs are a

public company in China and whose government has a 31.5% shareholding in it. In 1995 the

plaintiffs were given the licence to be the sole manufacturers of a product, known as

Yunnan Paiyao, for a period of 20 years. This product is a herbal drug claimed by its

manufacturers and purveyors to have been discovered over 100 years ago in China, and is

reputed for its homeostatic qualities. It is used for the arrest of bleeding and the

healing of wounds. The plaintiffs sued the defendants in this action for passing off the

Camellia brand of Yunnan Paiyao ("Camellia Yunnan Paiyao") as a product of the

plaintiffs. The first defendants are a Singapore company that imported Camellia Yunnan

Paiyao into Singapore. The second defendants are a partnership firm that sells traditional

Chinese medicine. One of the three partners of this firm, namely, Mr. Tong Yen Tien, is

also a director and shareholder of the first defendants. The Camellia Yunnan Paiyao is

distinctive by its yellow and red packaging as well as the trademark Camellia flower. The

plaintiffs acknowledge that this trademark belongs to a Chinese government-owned company

called Yunnan Medicines &amp; Health Products Import and Export Corporation

("YIE"). Camellia Yunnan Paiyao has been sold in Singapore through various

agents (other than the plaintiffs) for over 30 years in the yellow and red packaging. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        It is not disputed that by

an agreement of 18 May 2000 the first defendants were appointed the sole agents for YIE in

Singapore for the distribution and sale of YIE products including the Camellia Yunnan

Paiyao. It is not disputed that at all material times YIE purchased its supply of Yunnan

Paiyao from the plaintiffs under the terms of a written agreement. The plaintiffs conceded

that the Yunnan Piyao made by them is marketed under two brand names. One was the Camellia

Yunnan Paiyo, the other was Yunfeng Yunnan Baiyao. It is an important (undisputed) fact

that the packaging of the Camellia brand was done by the plaintiffs with materials (the

packaging) supplied to them by YIE. It is equally important to note at the outset that

this was not a case of a sole agent trying to steal his principal's mark. The

incontrovertible fact was that the get-up of the Camellia brand Yunnan Paiyao belongs to

YIE. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the words Yunnan Paiyao in English as well

as in Chinese constituted a mark which belonged to the plaintiffs. I shall revert to this

argument shortly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        The evidence was not very

precise or comprehensive, but sufficient for me to find that the Yunnan Provincial

government appears to have an interest in this product. Hence, when a rift appeared

between the plaintiffs and YIE sometime between 1995 and 1996, the state intervened and

helped to mediate a settlement. It is not clear whether a legally binding settlement had

been reached under Chinese law, but there is an unchallenged report documenting the

assertion by the provincial government that the Yunnan Paiyao is a national treasure and

ought to be properly preserved and marketed. It suggested the formalisation of what was

already the practice in which Yunfeng Yunnan Baiyao is sold domestically, while the

Camellia Yunnan Paiyao is sold internationally. It is noted that the product itself is

essentially the same; only the name and packaging differ. This much was conceded by the

plaintiffs, at least until April 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The significance of April

1998 is that at that time the plaintiffs asserted that YIE were in breach of contract and

had not made payments due to them. YIE, in turn, asserted that the plaintiffs were in

breach in not delivering supplies in the manner and quantity required. The dispute between

them is immaterial to this action save that consequent upon the dispute, the plaintiffs

(unilaterally, according to YIE) terminated their contract with YIE in April 1998.

Thereafter, on 25 December 2001, the plaintiffs appointed a Singapore company called Teck

Hong Hung Pte Ltd (a company incorporated in 1996) as its sole agents in the distribution

and sale of Yunfeng Yunnan Baiyao (in Singapore). Teck Hong Hung’s managing director

is one Mr. Chan Yan Chye. He testified that he was introduced to the plaintiffs in July

2000 and he expressed an interest in distributing the plaintiffs' product for them in

Singapore. It will be noted that May - July 2000 was also the time the first defendants

were in touch with YIE to become their sole agents in Singapore. Reverting to Mr. Chan, he

testified that he conducted a market survey and found that the Camellia brand was by far

better known than the plaintiffs' Yunfeng brand that was sold in a red, green and white

packaging. Mr. Chan reported this survey to the plaintiffs, and also submitted some

samples of Yin’s Camellia Yunnan Paiyao, as well as some samples of the plaintiffs'

Yunfeng Yunnan Baiyao, to the Health Sciences Authority ("HSA") for testing. The

HSA found an excessive concentration of mercury in the Camellia Yunnan Paiyao, but only a

trace element in Yunfeng Yunnan Baiyao. Consequently, the defendants were ordered to

withdraw the Camellia brand from the market. It transpired at trial before me, that in

both brands - the Yunfeng as well as the Camellia brand - there is a tiny red pill in each

packet of Yunnan Paiyao capsule and also one in each bottle of the powdered form. This one

tiny pill was meant for instances of severe pain. It is this pill that contains mercury.

It is the same for the Yungfeng pill as well as the Camellia pill. The capsules and powder

of both brands do not contain mercury. However, Mr. Chan sent only the red pill of the

Camellia brand but, at the same time, sent only the plaintiffs' capsule (without the red

pill) to HSA for testing. This episode was relevant in that the plaintiffs had initially

sought to show that the defendants' product was a counterfeit because of the mercury

content in the Camellia Yunnan Paiyao, and none in the Yunfeng Yunnan Baiyao. After Mr.

Chan was cross-examined, this point no longer featured in the plaintiffs' case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Some trap purchases were

made of the Camellia brand Yunnan Paiyao on behalf of the plaintiffs, and subsequently,

the defendants' stocks were seized and the plaintiffs commenced this action. The supply in

question concerned four shipments of Camellia Yunnan Paiyao ordered by the first

defendants and delivered by YIE through Cheerwise Industrial Ltd ("Cheerwise"),

their joint-venture partners in Hong Kong. The evidence of Mr. Tong and Miss Xue Xiaoli,

the export manager of YIE, was that the supply of Camellia Yunnan Paiyao to the first

defendants came from stocks ordered by YIE from the plaintiffs prior to April 1998, with

the exception of the third shipment in which YIE bought some Yunfeng brand directly from

the Yunan Paiyao Group Corporation which they say, is the plaintiffs' parent company. YIE

then sent that shipment to Cheerwise who re-packaged them into the Camellia packaging,

complete with Camellia brand literature before re-exporting them to the first defendants

in Singapore. At this point, it would be convenient to deal with one evidential issue.

Miss Neo, counsel for the plaintiffs, made a valiant attempt to establish a break in the

paper trail leading from the orders from the first defendants to the delivery of the

supplies under the four shipments. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        One of her main grounds

was that the numbers did not tally. The plaintiffs had a report that referred to the

quantity supplied on one shipment as "4g x 6 bottles" and the total sum of the

order would, if based on that scale, be 30,000 bottles - not the 60,000 bottles that the

defendants said they ordered. Miss Xue carefully took me through the relevant invoices

that clearly dispelled any notion that less than 60,000 were ordered. Miss Xue further

explained that the "4g x 6 bottles" was the description on the plaintiffs'

standard, printed form and was in fact referring to their product for the domestic market.

The invoices for the export market indicates "4g x 10 bottles". I find this

explanation perfectly acceptable, not only because there was no significant countervailing

argument against it, but also that I find Miss Xue to be a very reliable witness who had

first-hand knowledge of the dealings between the plaintiffs and YIE, as well as between

YIE and Cheerwise and the first defendants. Her evidence on this point was consistent with

the purchase documents as well as with the evidence of Mr. Tong Yen Tien (who purchased

them from YIE for the first defendants). He is also a witness who I judge to be reliable. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        The amended statement of

claim pleaded a single cause of action, namely the tort of passing off. The particulars of

the wrong are pleaded in 10 of the Statement of Claim to the following. First, that the

defendants' product contained the description that the product was manufactured by the

plaintiffs, and the packaging on the defendants' product also bear the words "Yunnan

Paiyao" in English as well as in Chinese characters. The only difference being that

the plaintiffs' spelling of "Baiyao" was changed to "Paiyao".

Secondly, the defendants advertised the claim that they were "the sole agents in

Singapore of the products of the plaintiffs, that the product was founded in 1914, and

that the products were from Yunnan, China". This point was not pursued at trial.

Thirdly, the defendants sold products manufactured by the plaintiffs with an express

representation that the product expiry date was 2004 when the expiry dates were 1999 and

2001 for the capsule and powder forms respectively.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        What is the tort of

passing off? It is the civil wrong of attempting to mislead the public in thinking that

the defendant's product was in fact a product of the plaintiff. But by itself, this is of

no advantage unless the plaintiff's product enjoys a goodwill that the defendants may

benefit from the passing off. What is the goodwill claimed by the plaintiffs in the

present case? They clearly do not, and indeed could not, claim goodwill in the Camellia

trademark or the YIE packaging. The Camellia brand Yunnan Paiyao in its well-known yellow

and red packaging had been sold in Singapore for over 30 years; whereas, there was only

the merest hint that the Yunfeng brand Yunnan Paiyao in its red, green and white packaging

was sold in Singapore. In any event, it was not disputed that, if at all, the Yunfeng

brand was sold in Singapore only after 1997. The present sole distributor for the

plaintiffs, Teck Hong Hung Pte Ltd, only purchased one shipment in 2001 but that had, on

Mr. Chan's evidence, been stored in his company’s warehouse ever since, waiting to be

exported. The previous sole distributor was Science Art Co Pte Ltd but they were not

called, and there was no evidence of any retail sale. Counsel for the plaintiffs, Miss

Neo, alluded to a statement made by Mr. Tong that after 1997 there were two brands being

marketed in Singapore, namely the Yungfeng brand and the Camellia brand. In the context

and circumstances of the case (Mr. Tong was not cross-examined on this point), I am of the

view that Mr. Tong was making a broad statement to express the undisguised fact that the

plaintiffs were intending to sell their Yunfeng brand in Singapore after 1997. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        The incontrovertible

evidence was that the Camellia brand was the dominant and pervasive brand in Singapore. <i>Hirsch

v Jonas</i> (1876) 3 Ch 584 relied upon by Miss Neo, is distinguishable. It was almost an

inverse sort of situation; but more importantly, it was an application for an

interlocutory injunction which Jessel M.R. felt he was unable to grant because he could

see no reason to stop someone from selling cigars as those manufactured by him when they

were in fact manufactured by him. Hence, the only claim to goodwill in the present case

must be (I choose these words carefully because the plaintiffs' claim as pleaded and

presented was somewhat amorphous) in respect of the words "Yunnan Paiyao" in

both English and Chinese. Mr. Tan SC, counsel for the defendants submitted that

"Yunnan Paiyao" are descriptive words to which no one party may claim any

goodwill through their use of them. It is not disputed that "Yunnan Paiyao" -

whether the Paiyao is spelt with a "P" or a "B" - means "white

medicine from Yunnan". It is thus no different from descriptive terms such as

"Life Nourishing Wine", in <i>Yomeishu Seizo Co Ltd v Sinma Medical Products (S)

Pte Ltd</i> [1991] SLR 499, for example. The law does sometimes recognise, as evident in

Lord Herschell's judgment in <i>Reddaway v Banham</i> [1896] 13 RPC 218, that a plaintiff

may acquire goodwill in words taken from the common stock of language, but it is not

difficult to understand that in such cases the law also requires the plaintiff to prove in

the most satisfactory manner that by the defendant's use of those words, by themselves

without explanation, will deceive the consumer in believing that he was getting the

plaintiff's goods. There was no basis, therefore, for the plaintiffs to assert that the

words Yunnan Paiyao, whether in English or Chinese, whether spelt with a "P" or

a "B", belonged to them, or were used by them in Singapore. Moreover, the

plaintiffs evidence was that they obtained the rights to manufacture Yunnan Paiyao from a

small diverse group of manufacturers in 1996, and that this was obtained by a written

agreement. Nothing in that agreement expressed an assignment of any proprietary claim to

the words Yunnan Paiyao, or an assignment of any such right to an exclusive use of them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        At first glance, the

circumstances in the present case appear nebulous, but that is due to the plaintiffs'

implicit assertion that the public had associated "Yunnan Paiyao" as the

plaintiffs' product. The evidence show that there was no basis for such a notion. There

was no evidence to show that the public was likely to have asked for "Yunnan

Paiyao" as opposed to "Camellia Yunnan Paiyao", when asking for the product

at retail outlets. But even if one assumes that the consumer was more likely to ask simply

for "Yunnan Paiyao", it is important to bear in mind the context and

circumstances, namely, that the Camellia brand was the predominant brand in Singapore for

a long time. Even the managing director of the plaintiffs' sole agent, Mr. Chan, conceded

in his affidavit that his market research showed that the Camellia brand was

"widespread" in Singapore as compared to the Yunfeng brand - and his market

research was conducted in 2001. Hence, I have little difficulty in finding that when the

consumer asked for "Yunnan Paiyao" he was more likely to have in mind YIE's

brand and not the plaintiffs' Yunfeng brand. Hence, when YIE used the plaintiffs' product

labelled with the Camellia get-up, they were selling the product "Camellia Yunnan

Paiyao". It cannot in any way be described as passing off their product as that of

the plaintiffs' product. One would hardly know what the plaintiffs' product was in that

situation save that the YIE packaging acknowledged that the manufacturer was the plaintiff

(which was the fact). In those circumstances, the defendants' sale of the Camellia brand

flatters more than it harms the plaintiffs. No harm or damage was, in fact, proved in the

present case before me. Since <i>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc</i> [1990] RPC 341, it is now axiomatic to declare that damage is a critical element in an action for

passing off. In the absence of damage, the action cannot succeed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        If, as I find, that the

words "Yunnan Paiyao", whether in English or Chinese, whether spelt with a

"P" or a "B", are merely descriptive of the product; and that (by the

plaintiffs' concession) the Camellia trademark and packaging belongs to YIE, the only

straw upon which the plaintiffs may construct a case of passing off , is to prove that the

contents in the Camellia packaging were counterfeit, that is, not the product professed to

be manufactured by the plaintiffs. The basis of the passing would have to rest on the

statement carried on the YIE product, that the contents were manufactured by the

plaintiffs. The burden of proof of counterfeiting lay with the plaintiffs. The evidence

before me, however, shows that the contents of all the four shipments sold by YIE to the

first defendants were manufactured by the plaintiffs and sold by them to YIE. Even in

respect of the third shipment which concerned only the powder form (when YIE ran out of

stock and had to purchase from the Yunnan Pharmaceutical Group Corporation), there were no

satisfactory evidence to prove otherwise. Throughout the trial, whenever the plaintiffs'

witnesses were challenged to say how they are able to compare their product with those

purchased from YIE, they could only respond by saying that the plaintiffs' formula is a

secret. But that secret was the only key to proving that the YIE product was fake although

Mr. Yang Yun, the chemist in the plaintiffs' employ, testified that by the absence of

certain unique fragrance he could tell that the YIE product was not that of the

plaintiffs. There was no proper or detailed report as to how and under what conditions the

YIE product was tested; nor the type and nature of the compounds that give off the unique

fragrance that Mr. Yang talked about. I have, therefore, no sufficient cause to trust his

nose. Mr. Yang also mentioned that there was an excessive presence of calcium oxalate

crystals in the sample of the defendants' product that he tested. No further information

was given, and I do not know what caused the sample to have more calcium oxalate crystals;

what the calcium oxalate crystals do to or for the product; nor why that is significant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        I shall now come to the

product expiry date. Miss Neo submitted that selling a product when it had passed the

product expiry date is an indication that the products were counterfeit goods. But the

thrust of her case on this point was that expired goods created a misrepresentation of the

quality of the product. She argued that when expired goods are sold, the quality of the

product is compromised and the public will thus be (she did not present her case on the

basis of "had been") misled into thinking that they are purchasing the genuine

(unexpired) product of the plaintiffs. Counsel relied on a series of authorities in

support of the proposition she advanced, the essence of which is best captured in the a

passage from Christopher Wadlow's <i>Law of Passing Off</i>, at page 162: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"There is one category of case in which it is essential that the

    goods offered by the defendant should be of a recognisably different quality to those of

    the plaintiff. That is where the defendant is dealing in goods which really are those of

    the plaintiff, but is passing off one quality for another. In theory, all that is

    necessary is that there should be two distinct categories of goods, but in practice this

    form of passing off is likely to occur in the form of inferior goods being passed off as

    the superior."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I think that it must be obvious that this form of passing off must

involve a product that is proved to be inferior to the one under comparison. The

authorities cited by Miss Neo indicate that that must be so. Hence, in each of them, the

product complained of were of a different grade than a superior version made by the same

manufacturer, usually for a different market. In <i>A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros v V.A.W.

Gamage</i> (1915) 32 RPC 273 the defendant was selling an inferior ball, different in

quality from the then newly famous "Orb" ball, and passing off the former as the

latter. In <i>Colgate-Palmolive Ltd v Markwell Finance Ltd </i>(1989) RPC 497, the

defendants were selling a much different version of the plaintiff's renown Colgate

toothpaste. The inferior version, intended for sale in Brazil, was lacking in fluoride,

had a lower quality abrasive constituent, and contained preservative not present in the

superior version. All that rendered the product distinctly different from that sold by the

plaintiff in the United Kingdom. In <i>Champagne Heidsieck et Cie v Scotto &amp; Bishop</i>

(1926) 43 RPC 101 the plaintiff succeeded in an action brought to prevent the sale of a

wine in the United Kingdom that was intended by its maker to be sold only on the

continent. It was the same with <i>Wilkinson Sword Ltd v Cripps v Lee Ltd</i> [1982] FSR

16 where it was held that an action in passing off would lie where a defendant imports

razor blades made by the same manufacturer if the imported blade is clearly of an inferior

quality meant for another market. These cases maintain the proposition that one cannot

pass off an inferior quality product as the superior one. But the difference in quality

must be proved. The printing of expiry dates is only an indicia that the product has

passed its shelf life, resulting in a deterioration of the product's quality. Passing off

in such cases is not about the diligence, or accuracy, in the printing of the expiry date,

but of actual differences in quality. The difference is a fact that must be proved.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        The burden was on the

plaintiff to first prove that the goods sold by the defendants had actually passed the

expiry date. The evidence before me was that at the material time, the Chinese authorities

did not require expiry dates to be shown on the product. The evidence that I accept is

that the requirement came into force, only after the event, in December 2001. The expiry

dates were printed in order to satisfy the Singapore authorities' requirement. Miss Xue,

whose evidence I accept, testified that she that there was no requirement in China to

disclose the expiry date of the product. The expiry date was not an issue there. However,

since Singapore importers required a date to be printed, and through experience she was

able to say that the Yunnan Paiyao products could last between 8 to 10 years, she decided

on a slightly more conservative figure of 6 years and used that as the expiry date. The

other point that Miss Neo made was that if it was true that the stocks in question were

purchased by YIE in 1997, then the expiry date would have been 4 years at the latest and

that would have lapsed in 2001, and not 2004 as printed by YIE. She relied on the document

PB6 to PB9 in support. I am, however, not satisfied with this document. Although it was

purportedly issued by the Yunnan State Drug Administration Bureau it was adduced by the

plaintiffs' witness one Zeng Tianyu. In any event, Miss Xue explained that the plaintiffs

had never told them what the expiry dates were. Hence, I am of the view that even if the

expiry date, as determined by the plaintiff, was 2001, YIE would not have known about it.

It seems to me reasonably obvious from Miss Xue's evidence, that YIE never thought that

the expiry date was an important issue. The plaintiffs never told YIE about it, and they

(YIE) printed it only because the importing country's regulations (not China's) required

it to be done. Indeed, the plaintiffs' own packaging also did not carry any expiry date at

the material time. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        Secondly, the plaintiffs

were obliged to prove that the product sold by YIE to the defendants were of an inferior

quality. This they failed to do. No evidence was presented to persuade me that the

Camellia Yunnan Paiyao was in any way inferior to that marketed under Yunfeng Yunnan

Baiyao. In the same way that evidence is required to prove that the YIE product was

counterfeit, the plaintiffs were obliged, in my opinion, to prove the actual differences

in quality. I accept that in many cases the maker would be best placed to tell his own

product from a counterfeit. Sometimes, as in the case of jeans, for example, it is by the

way they sew the seams, or from the shape and thickness of its buttons; but in cases such

as the present where scientific evidence is required, it is almost impossible to make a

positive finding in the absence of reliable scientific evidence. If laboratory tests are

required, as would most certainly be the case here, the samples must be properly

identified, the criteria and procedure for the tests to be clearly set out, and the

findings properly reported. The testing centre and its facilities ought to be adduced as

part of the evidence. The methodology and procedure for scientific tests are crucial. It

will be presumptuous to regard a witness' (the plaintiffs' Mr. Yang Yun) nose as an

accurate scientific equipment. It was also not to the plaintiffs' advantage in any way

when they spurned the defendants' offer to have the products tested by independent

laboratories in China. Protecting a secret formula is an inadequate excuse. It was only in

the course of her final submission that Miss Neo ventured to say that the secret formula

may only be disclosed with state approval; but nothing was done to indicate whether the

plaintiffs supported the idea of an independent test, and to that end, were prepared to

give their consent so that the state may view the application for approval more

favourably. It was a case of too little, too late. I should add that I am not laying any

rule to the effect that scientific evidence can only be adduced from independent

laboratories. Each case must be considered on its own facts. In this case, even the

plaintiffs' own laboratory proved to be of little assistance not only for lack of a proper

report of the procedure and methodology used, but also by the plaintiffs' insistence on

maintaining the secrecy of its formula.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        Furthermore, the evidence

appears to be to the contrary. The product whether branded as Camellia or Yunfeng was the

same although the brands were to be marketed in different countries. As it transpired, the

plaintiffs themselves say that their Yungfeng brand was being marketed in Singapore, or at

least, intended to be sold in Singapore. No evidence was led to show that the Yunfeng

brand was of a superior quality to the Camellia brand. The plaintiffs' claim that the

passing off consist of the passing off of counterfeit or, alternatively, an inferior

product for the superior one, failed for want of proof.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        In respect of the

plaintiffs' claim that the first defendants' third shipment contained counterfeit goods

because of YIE and Cheerwise's admission that they had changed the labels of the

plaintiffs' product in powder form. The central issue was, whether the product was

manufactured by Plaintiff? Can plaintiff reasonably infer that if packaging was altered

the product is a counterfeit? In some instances it is an indicia of wrongdoing. In this

case, there was a sound explanation on the facts as well as a reasonable rebuttal on the

law and practice. I find no evidence that the contents were changed. On this point, I find

the evidence of Mr. Cheng from Cheerwise and Miss Xue from YIE to be reasonable and

reliable, and I accept their evidence entirely. There was no evidence to contradict them

as this was a matter entirely within their knowledge and not that of the plaintiffs. I am

unable to accept the conclusions to the contrary that Miss Neo wanted me to draw. Those

arguments were based on assumptions concerning the expiry dates and batch numbers (which,

Miss Xue explained, were provided by YIE to the plaintiffs anyway). These assumptions pale

in comparison to the direct, forceful and clear evidence of Mr. Cheng and Miss Xue, and to

some extent, the supporting evidence of Miss Dan. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        Finally, if this case can

properly be categorised as a case of parallel importation - although I do not think that

it can be because there is no evidence that the plaintiffs were selling their product in

Singapore, and in view of my finding that the Camellia brand Yunnan Paiyao was neither

their mark or product - the law affords no relief to the plaintiffs. So far as parallel

imports are concerned, if a product imported by a parallel trader is indeed the

plaintiff's product, the importation and sale does not amount to a passing off. <i>Sin

Heak Hin Pte Ltd v Yuasa Battery Singapore Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9631&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 590</a>, 610. Dealt with

this point directly although that case was essentially a libel action. The issue of

passing off was an important part of the case, and was dealt with comprehensively by

Judith Prakash J. I need not refer to the case at length, save to say that the essence of

that part of the judgment is that a Yuasa battery is a Yuasa battery, and no question of

passing off can arise if a trader imports the genuine product in competition with the

maker's own stock in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        For the reasons above,

the plaintiffs' claim is dismissed. I shall hear parties on the question of costs at a

later date.</p>
