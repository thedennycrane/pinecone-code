<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">99<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> From the telephone records and other evidence before me, it appeared that there was one telephone conversation between the accused and Jalil in the afternoon of 4 August 2002 and two telephone conversations between the accused and Jalil in the evening of 4 August 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In all the three calls, Jalil spoke to Widiyarti also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To this extent, the evidence of Widiyarti about having spoken to Jalil once only in the evening of 4 August 2002 was not correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">100<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> As for the allegation that Widiyarti was unhappy with Jalil for not planning to come to the Flat that night, I accepted that she was unhappy about this but not to the extent that they quarrelled over it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both of them denied any quarrel and they had hardly any time to discuss their evidence before the trial as Jalil was arrested on 5 August 2002 (NE 457) and thereafter did not speak to Widiyarti (NE 488 to 489).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">101<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> As for the presence of Widiyarti in the guestroom at the time the accused took the baby away, this was not disputed when Widiyarti was giving evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused gave similar evidence to this effect in evidence-in-chief (NE 645 line 4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, when he was cross-examined, he said that Widiyarti was in the living room watching TV at the material time (NE 713 to 714).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I did not know why the accused gave different evidence at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suffice it for me to say that I was of the view that Widiyarti was in the guestroom when the accused took the baby. However, the baby was already sleeping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was no bona fide reason for the accused to take the baby at such a late hour. Initially he suggested that the reason for taking the baby was that he wanted Widiyarti to calm down (NE 715 line 8).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, he said it was his habit to bring the baby to his bedroom (NE 715 line 12).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I did not accept those reasons because it was not as though the baby was crying and Widiyarti was becoming more and more upset because of Jalil and the baby or the baby was awake and the accused wanted to play with the baby.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">109<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> It was not disputed that the reference to “12.50am on 6 August 2002” in the s 122(6) statement was to a wrong date as the accused’s reference was intended to be 5 August 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The interpreter who interpreted his statement to ASP Ang said that the accused mentioned the date of 6 August 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I accepted this evidence because the interpreter was unlikely to know whether the date should be 5 or 6 August 2002 and since the accused was giving his statement on 6 August 2002, he probably inadvertently mentioned 6 August 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Be that as it may, that inadvertent error did not mean that the accused was confused when he identified Jalil as the man who had come with Widiyarti to take the baby away i.e Mr X.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">110<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> I would add that when evidence was being given for the prosecution, the questions from Mr Anandan were consistent with the position that Jalil was Mr X or might be Mr X.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For example, after it had been earlier established through Raghavan’s evidence that Jalil had been with his co-workers during the night of 4 August 2002 until about 2.30am of 5 August 2002, Mr Anandan was still suggesting to Jalil, during cross-examination, that he could have taken a taxi to the Flat after 2.30am and then subsequently returned to his place of rest before 5.30am (NE 533 to 534).</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">112<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> I also found it implausible that while the accused claimed that he had refused an earlier request from Widiyarti to allow a man to stay at the Flat, the accused did not bother to find out the identity of Mr X when Mr X came to his bedroom and returned to the guestroom in the middle of the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused’s evidence was only that thereafter he went to the guestroom to tell Widiyarti that the baby was crying as he was afraid that someone would complain to the police about the noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not ask Widiyarti who Mr X was (NE 734).</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">51.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> That reason is also not applied consistently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In practice, the prosecution would furnish an accused person with cautioned statements recorded from him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Cautioned statements may be used for impeachment in the same way as investigation statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the former is furnished, there is no reason why the latter should not.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">53.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> There is another point to be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is that when a reasonable request is made, it should be considered with an open mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unless there are reasons to believe that granting of a request will lead to abuse, it would be unreasonable to deny it on the ground that it may lead to abuse.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">54.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I am also uncomfortable about the requirement that the accused discloses his defence to the prosecution first if he wants to have his investigation statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is no obligation for an accused to disclose his defence to the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That position was abridged slightly by s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code whereby an accused is warned and advised to state his defence after he has been charged, lest his defence be less likely to be believed if he withheld it till his trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a limited change as the accused is not compelled to make a statement, and he is not liable to punishment if he elects not to give one.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">55.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Against this background, the request that an accused discloses his defence is a radical step which must be given serious consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where is the authority for it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How is the defence to be disclosed - by counsel or a signed statement by the accused?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How detailed must it be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is the evidential nature of such a disclosure?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If such requests are to become part of the prosecution practice, they should be clearly provided for by law, in the way that s 122 was enacted to enable cautioned statements to be recorded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It should not be left to be dealt with on an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ad hoc</i> basis.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">56.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Another issue was raised, whether statements should be admitted in evidence when they are supplied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such statements would be admitted if the accused or the prosecution wants them to be admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If no one wants them, there is no necessity for such statements to be admitted in evidence for no purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is how cautioned statements are dealt with, and the same practice should apply to investigation statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If an accused who had received his statements decides not to introduce them in evidence, there is no reason to make him do it.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">132<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> So, before me, the prosecution had decided not to use the statements in question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the defence had considered that those statements might have been helpful to the accused, then the defence should have requested the statements from the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the prosecution should refuse the request, then the defence should have applied to the court to direct that such statements be made available to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the court should give such a direction, then it was for the defence to decide whether to use the statements or not after it received them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the court should decline to give such a direction but left it to the prosecution to decide whether to let the defence have those statements, then it would be open to the defence to submit that an inference favourable to the accused should be drawn, although a bare submission like that would probably carry little weight.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">133<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> Here, the defence did not ask the prosecution for the statements or apply to court for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On my part, I would be inclined to encourage and, if necessary, direct any prosecution to let the defence have such statements in response to such a request or application unless, as Kan J said, there are reasons to believe that to do so would lead to abuse.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">134<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> I was also of the view that in the case before me, the prosecution should have responded positively to the defence’s submission by offering to let the defence have the statements, even though there was no specific request for them, and, if the defence wanted them, then leaving it to the defence to decide what use, if any, it would make of them, and then respond thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This would be preferable to relying on the three possibilities advocated to me.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">135<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> Be that as it may, the defence’s submission was a bare one, even if I were to put aside the point that it did not request or apply for the statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused did not say which part of his oral evidence had been earlier disclosed by him in those statements and neither did his counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was of the view that it would be unsafe for me to infer that every material aspect of his oral evidence could be found in those statements in the circumstances, especially since his oral evidence about Mr X had already contradicted his earlier statements to the police and his 122(6) statement as well as his position before he gave evidence, as demonstrated through his counsel’s questions to the prosecution witnesses, including Jalil.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">136<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> Moreover, even if, for the sake of argument, those statements contained the same allegations as the rest of the accused’s oral evidence on other matters aside from Mr X, they were not necessarily true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had to be considered in the light of the evidence for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As I have said, the prosecution did not rely solely on Widiyarti’s evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was other evidence which I have set out above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To recapitulate briefly, there was evidence of the chlorpheniramine in the baby’s blood and liver, the DNA evidence of the accused’s blood on one pillow and, more importantly, the baby’s blood on both pillows, as well as the accused’s and the baby’s blood on the beige towel on the raffia string in his bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was the accused’s mattress without a bed-sheet covering it and the brown bed-sheet wrapped round the baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was evidence about the accused’s experience in tying.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">137<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> In the circumstances, I was drawn irresistibly to the conclusion that the accused had committed the crime for which he was charged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted and sentenced the accused accordingly.</span></p>
