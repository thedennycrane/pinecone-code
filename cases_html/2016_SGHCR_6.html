</div> On 22 June 2012 MAN Germany wrote to Skaugen Norway, this time conceding that there were indications that the fuel consumption values for three engines were “externally influenced in an improper manner during [FATs]”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The parties thereafter attempted to settle but negotiations broke down in September 2013 and there was a dispute over whether a binding settlement was reached. While Skaugen and MAN Germany did not enter into a direct contractual relationship for the MAN engines installed in the Vessels, they did enter into such a direct contractual relationship for three other batches of engines that are not the subject of the current suit. This suit is not the first time that the parties have found themselves at legal loggerheads. One round of ICC arbitration, commenced in September 2013 between Skaugen Norway and Skaugen Singapore, and MAN Germany, concluded that the parties had not concluded a binding settlement agreement. The parties are currently separately engaged in arbitration in the Danish Institute of Arbitration, arbitration in the ICC, and litigation in the Norwegian courts. GATX and some Skaugen entities had also purportedly assigned their claims to the plaintiffs, and there is some controversy over whether the assignors had claims to begin with. I deal with these facts more fully later on in the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The pleadings and arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The plaintiffs, in their statement of claim, plead that representations were made in the PPM, FSI and FATs that the MAN engines consumed fuel at a certain rate, but these were false; and the plaintiffs were induced to rely and did rely on those representations. The plaintiffs have also provided particulars of alleged negligence and fraud. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The defendants applied (Summons No 3879 of 2015 is MAN Germany’s application while Summons No 5334 of 2015 is MAN Norway’s application) to set aside service <span class="font-italic">ex juris </span>of the writ; alternatively for proceedings to be stayed on the grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>; and in the further alternative, for a stay on case management grounds pending the determination of other proceedings. They argue that the claim does not fall within any of the gateway provisions enumerated in O 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed): the plaintiffs are not the proper claimants; none of the relevant acts or omissions constituting the alleged tort had occurred in Singapore (O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i)); the damage allegedly suffered did not occur in Singapore (O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii)); and the alleged cause of action did not arise in Singapore (O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>)). Singapore is also not the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> – Germany or alternatively Norway is the appropriate forum. Lastly proceedings should be stayed pending the resolution of disputes elsewhere. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The plaintiffs resist the defendants’ application and argue that O 11 r 1 is satisfied: the torts occurred at least in part in Singapore and damage has been suffered in Singapore. The defendants have not discharged their burden of showing that Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> – and in this respect due regard must be had for the recent establishment of the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”). The proceedings should not be stayed on case management principles because the other proceedings pertain to different subjects.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I shall deal with the following issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What is the test for the assumption of long-arm jurisdiction by the Singapore High Court in light of the establishment of the SICC? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Do the plaintiffs have the requisite <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi</span>?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) What is the applicable law?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Do the plaintiffs have a good arguable case that their claim satisfies one or more of the limbs of O 11?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Would the SICC have jurisdiction for the purposes of applying <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Is Singapore the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What is the test for the assumption of long-arm jurisdiction by the Singapore High Court in light of the establishment of the SICC? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The parties were in agreement that O 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court applies to the service <span class="font-italic">ex juris </span>of writs. But the parties differed over how the principles enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada Maritime Corp v </span><span class="font-italic">Cansulex Ltd</span> [1987] AC 460 (“<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>”) should apply, and in particular whether less weight should be placed on certain factors because of the recent establishment of the SICC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I pause to briefly set out the law as it currently stands. Service <span class="font-italic">ex juris</span> will be allowed to stand if and only if: the plaintiff shows a good arguable case that its claim falls within one of the limbs of O 11 r 1 (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span><span class="font-italic">Electrolok Ltd v Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span>”) at [14]); the plaintiff’s claim has a sufficient degree of merit, that is, there is a serious issue to be tried (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>at [14]); and Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd </span> [2014] 4 SLR 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>”) at [26]). In this respect, if a plaintiff can show a good arguable case that his tort claim falls within one of the limbs of O 11 r 1, he would <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>satisfy the lower standard of there being a serious issue to be tried (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I am bound to apply the above – O 11 r 1 is subsidiary legislation; while <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>and <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>are decisions of the Court of Appeal. The establishment of the SICC does not alter the applicable legal principles, at the High Court level, in respect of the long-arm jurisdiction of the High Court (but see [141]–[145] below). But a factors-based test is applied to determine if Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. A factors-based test for adjudication is, according to Sunstein, marked by several features, some of which include: multiple and diverse relevant criteria; the difficulty of describing relevant factors <span class="font-italic">ex ante</span>; and pertinently the absence of a clear, <span class="font-italic">a priori </span>sense of the weight of the criteria (Cass R Sunstein, “Problems with Rules”, (1995) 83 Cal L Rev 953 at pp 998–999). This is confirmed by case law. <span class="font-italic">BDA v BDB </span>[2013] 1 SLR 607 held that the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test is a factors-based test, with the weight to be placed on the various factors varying with each factual matrix; a factor that proves to be the tipping point in one case might not be that important in another (at [24]). <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 held that the weight of the various connecting factors is not a numbers game and it is legal significance which is decisive (at [85]); as such, an appellate court would not interfere with what is an exercise of discretion by a lower court unless a judge has misdirected himself as a matter of principle; or had taken into account matters he should not have taken into account or had not taken into account matters which he ought to have taken into account (at [84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is therefore perfectly consistent with the factors-based <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test for a court to take the presence of the SICC into account in determining whether Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. The <span class="font-italic">raison </span><span class="font-italic">d’etre </span>of the SICC is the provision of an “internationally accepted dispute resolution procedural framework for the resolution of international commercial disputes in accordance with substantive principles of international law” (Report of the Singapore International Commercial Court Committee (29 November 2013), last accessed on 9 March 2016 and available at <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/dam/minlaw/corp/News/Annex%20A%20-</span><span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">%20SICC%20Committee%20Report.pdf</span> (“Report of the SICC Committee”) at para 14); and to that end, amongst other things, foreign counsel may appear in the SICC (s 36P of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed); foreign law may be determined on the basis of submissions rather than proof (O 110 r 25 of the Rules of Court); and International Judges from both common law and civil law jurisdictions have been appointed (pursuant to Art 95(4)(c) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint)).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the context of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>, and depending on the exact facts of the case, it is conceivable for certain factors to have less weight because of the presence of the SICC. For instance, the ability of foreign counsel to directly submit on foreign law, without the need for the content of foreign law to be proven through expert evidence, could obviate the inconvenience of trying a claim that is governed by foreign law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Nonetheless, the presence of the SICC should affect the weight assigned to <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>factors in the context of the assumption of long-arm jurisdiction if and only if the case is transferred from the High Court to the SICC upon the plaintiff successfully resisting the application to set aside service <span class="font-italic">ex juris</span>; and for the weight assigned to <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>factors in the context of a stay on the grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, likewise if and only if the case is transferred from the High Court to the SICC upon the plaintiff successfully resisting the application for a stay. This must necessarily follow – if the case is not transferred upon successful resistance then the court ought not to have allowed the presence of the SICC to influence the weight assigned to the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>factors in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I deal with the provisions relating to the transfer of cases from the High Court to the SICC. Section 18A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) states that the SICC is a division of the High Court; s 18D of the same provides for the SICC having jurisdiction where (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the action is international and commercial in nature; (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the action is one that the High Court may hear and try in its original civil jurisdiction; and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the action satisfies such other conditions as the Rules of Court may prescribe. Section 18J(2) of the SCJA in turn states that the High Court may transfer a case commenced in the High Court to the SICC in accordance with the Rules of Court. O 110 r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court in turn supplements s 18D of the SCJA and states that the SICC has jurisdiction where the claims between the plaintiffs and the defendants named in the originating process when it was first filed are of an international and commercial nature; while O 110 r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) states that the Court has jurisdiction if the parties do not seek any relief in the form of or connected with a prerogative order. O 110 r 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) states that the SICC has the jurisdiction to hear and determine a case transferred to it under O 110 r 12. O 110 r 12(1) in turn provides that a case commenced in the High Court may be transferred to the Court, and vice versa. O 110 r 12(4) in particular states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A case may be transferred from the High Court to the Court only if the following requirements are met:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the High Court considers that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the requirements in Rule 7(1)(a) and (c) are met; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) [Deleted by S 756/2015 wef 01/01/2016]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) it is more appropriate for the case to be heard in the Court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) either —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) a party has, with the consent of all other parties, applied for the transfer in accordance with Rule 13; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the High Court, after hearing the parties, orders the transfer on its own motion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 O 110 r 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court expressly provides for the SICC having jurisdiction if a case is transferred to the SICC from the High Court under O 110 r 12. This could suggest that the question of the internal allocation of jurisdiction between the High Court and the SICC as a division of the High Court must be determined cleanly and sequentially only after the question of the (long-arm) jurisdiction of the High Court has been answered; and this could be argued to be a bar to the application of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>principles with a transfer to the SICC in mind. This is a position that Professor Yeo Tiong Min SC could be construed to have taken: the High Court should decide the question of its own jurisdiction (in the private international law sense) before deciding if the case should be transferred to the SICC (Yeo Tiong Min SC, “Staying Relevant: Exercise of Jurisdiction in the Age of the SICC”, Eighth Yong Pung How Professorship of Law Lecture 2015 at para 41, available at <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">http://law.smu.edu.sg/sites/default/files/law/CEBCLA/YPH-Paper-2015.pdf</span> and last accessed on 9 March 2016 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Tiong Min</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I do not agree with such a strict separation. The application of the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>must keep up with the times, not just in terms of technological advancement but also with respect to institutional advances in dispute resolution. The SICC is at the cutting-edge in the latter regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The requirement of the local forum being the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>for the assumption of long-arm jurisdiction in fact pre-dates the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>decision and has a long pedigree: in <span class="font-italic">Strauss and Co v </span><span class="font-italic">Goldschmid </span>(1892) 8 TLR 512 it was held that “the convenience of the action being tried here or in the foreign country must… be considered” (at 513); in <span class="font-italic">Rosler</span><span class="font-italic"> v Hilbery </span>[1925] Ch 250 it was held that a court, in exercising its discretion whether to allow service <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">juris </span>would in particular “pay attention to what is the forum conveniens” (at 259); and in <span class="font-italic">Mauroux</span><span class="font-italic"> v Soc Com Abel Pereira Da Fonseca SARL </span>[1972] 1 WLR 962 it was held that the O 11 requirement that the case must be a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction “must include the issue of forum conveniens” (at 965B). This is because the ability to assume long-arm jurisdiction is a statutory exception to the general rule that a defendant must be personally served with a writ within the territory in order for a court to assume jurisdiction; and it was meant to mitigate injustice to local plaintiffs who could not personally serve a writ (“British Precedents for Due Process Limitations on In Personam Jurisdiction”, (1948) 48 Colum L Rev (author unknown) at p 607). But as a counterbalance the courts were mindful that they ought to be “exceedingly careful” and should seriously consider whether “[the] Court ought to put a foreigner who owes no allegiance here, to the inconvenience and annoyance of being brought to contest his rights in this country” (<span class="font-italic">Société</span><span class="font-italic"> Générale de Paris v Dreyfus Brothers </span>(1885) 29 ChD 239 at 242–243). As a matter of brute empirical fact, the level of inconvenience and annoyance suffered by defendants has been decreasing: journeys that took days by ocean liner now take hours by plane; letters took weeks to arrive but emails are now instantaneous. Collins criticised in 1972 what he perceived to be “a tendency in the recent cases… to be somewhat less strict than what the authorities require” (Lawrence Collins, “Some Aspects of Service Out of the Jurisdiction in English Law”, (1972) 21 Int’l &amp; Comp LQ 656 at p 659) but with respect increasing laxity would have been justified by technological advancement. The Singapore Court of Appeal has gone so far as to recognise that “[t]he physical location of witnesses is no longer a vital or even very material consideration with the advent of video-link technology… [t]his applies a fortiori to the physical location of documents” (<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Holdrich Investment Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1007 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]). In much the same vein the SICC “represents a new way of thinking about international dispute resolution” and is the “first court of its kind in Asia that caters to foreign parties and foreign laws” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(4 November 2014) vol 92 (Hri Kumar Nair, Member of Parliament for Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency and K Shanmugam, Minister for Law respectively)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It would be inexcusably artificial to exclude the SICC from the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>calculus. The tail should not be allowed to wag the dog; and technical intricacies should not determine the substantive content of the law where this would be contrary to common reason. I note that Prof Yeo Tiong Min SC has also taken the view that “the common law requires all factors to be taken into consideration, and this must include the possibility of transfer to the SICC” (<span class="font-italic">Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Tiong Min</span> at para 47), and, to reiterate, the possibility of transfer to the SICC must be considered simultaneously with the High Court’s assumption of long-arm jurisdiction, lest the court take into account considerations that it ought not have taken into account were it to transpire that proceedings would not or ought not be transferred to the SICC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 After I reserved judgment, <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight International Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar </span>[2016] SGHC 40 (“<span class="font-italic">Accent </span><span class="font-italic">Delight</span>”) was released. This decision is in fact perfectly consistent with the foregoing paragraphs of this section. The plaintiffs claimed that they were wrongfully overcharged for fine art. The defendants were served as of right, and applied to stay proceedings on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. The High Court, in the initial portion of the judgment, did not appear to consider the SICC as part of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>calculus, but from the case report it appears that this is because the parties did not argue that <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>ought to be applied differently in light of the SICC. Further submissions on whether the case ought to be transferred to the SICC were requested, and the court thereafter held towards the end of the judgment that “the perceived advantages (to the defendants) or disadvantages (to the plaintiffs) of Switzerland being the forum will be levelled out if this Suit remains in Singapore but is transferred to the SICC” (at [111]). This is a clear reference to the SICC being taken into consideration as part of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>calculus.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I shall consider the issue of transfer alongside <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>in a later section. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Do the plaintiffs have the requisite </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">standi</span><span class="font-weight-bold">?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff must show a good arguable case that its claim falls within one of the limbs of O 11 r 1 and this is but an aspect of that. Nonetheless this is a threshold issue because the plaintiffs’ tort claim would fall <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">limine </span>if they do not have the requisite <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Vessels underwent several changes in ownership. Neither Skaugen Norway nor Skaugen Singapore have ever had direct ownership of the Vessels — the Vessels were only delivered between October 2002 and 2003; the rights under the first tranche of shipbuilding contracts were assigned to Somargas Cayman in August 2000; and Vintergas was the entity which contracted with the Chinese shipbuilders for the second tranche of shipbuilding contracts. Somargas Cayman and Vintergas entered into novation agreements with Somargas Ltd, a Hong Kong company 50% owned by Skaugen Norway and 50% owned by GATX (hereinafter “Somargas I”), in March 2002 to transfer all their respective rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities under all six contracts to Somargas I. Somargas I entered into an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) agreement with Norgas Limited and Norgas Carriers AS in June 2002 to pool the earnings and expenses of the Vessels. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In December 2004, Skaugen Singapore (then known as Norgas Carriers Pte Ltd) was awarded Approved International Shipping Enterprise (“AIS”) status by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore; in order to obtain tax breaks, the Skaugen Group agreed to conduct and manage their shipping business out of Singapore. In December 2009, Somargas I incorporated a Singapore subsidiary, Somargas II Pte Ltd (“Somargas II”); and later on the same month Skaugen Norway transferred its 50% stake in Somargas I to Somargas II. In February 2011, Somargas I transferred its ownership in the vessels and allegedly all its assets and liabilities to Somargas II. The Vessels thereafter were re-registered under the Singapore flag. Also in February 2011, Somargas II and Norgas Carriers AS entered into a ship management agreement to manage the vessels. In December 2011, Somargas I was liquidated; shares in Somargas II were equally distributed between Skaugen Singapore and GATX (which subsequently transferred these shares to GATX Asia Investments Pte Ltd (“GATX Asia”). In January 2012, Skaugen Singapore, Somargas II and other entitles in the Skaugen Group entered into a Norgas Pool Agreement in order to obtain the best possible commercial market terms for vessels in the pool. The pool manager is Norgas Carriers Pte Ltd, a Singapore-incorporated company in the Skaugen Group. In April 2013, Skaugen Norway and other entities in the Skaugen Group entered into an agreement with GATX and GATX-related entities to restructure: Skaugen Singapore would purchase GATX Asia’s 50% stake in Somargas II; three vessels would be fully owned by three separate GATX-related entities, all incorporated in Singapore; and three vessels would remain fully owned by Somargas II. Somargas II then sold the Norgas Sonoma to SGPC1 Pte Ltd in June 2013 for refinancing purposes; Skaugen Marine Investment Pte Ltd (“Skaugen Marine”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Skaugen Norway, owns 35% of the shares in SGPC1. In April 2014, Skaugen Singapore transferred its shares in Somargas II to Skaugen Marine. In November and December 2014, Somargas II sold Norgas Ptaluma and Norgas Napa to Gasmar AS and Zhonghua Hull No 451 LLC respectively, and both were bareboat chartered back to Skaugen Marine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiffs assert that the current and former owners and charterers of the vessels have assigned their rights, title and interest in the claims against MAN, including MAN Germany and MAN Norway, to the plaintiffs. The documentary evidence discloses two agreements. A Claims Transfer Agreement was entered into between GATX Corporation (not to be confused with GATX Third Aircraft Corporation, for which “GATX” has been defined as shorthand) and Skaugen Norway on 23 June 2014, governed by New York law. This agreement does not mention anything about GATX Corporation acting on behalf of its subsidiaries, but the first clause of the preamble does say that “GATX and [the Skaugen Group], directly and indirectly through their subsidiaries, have been partners in a joint venture related to the manufacturer ownership and operation of [the Vessels] with a share of 50 % each…”.

</div>
</div> An assignment agreement was entered into between Skaugen Singapore, Somargas II and Skaugen Marine on 27 January 2015 and purported to assign the claims of Somargas II and Skaugen Marine to Skaugen Singapore; and one Morits Skaugen, who affirms that he is the Chief Executive Officer of Skaugen Norway and Chairman of the Skaugen Group, signed the assignment agreement on behalf of all three parties. Despite all three parties being Singapore-incorporated companies, the assignment agreement was stated to be governed by the laws of Norway. The assignment agreement does not refer to Somargas II and Skaugen Marine acting on behalf of any other Skaugen-related entity. Clause A of the preamble does however state that “the Parties constitute current or former – direct or indirect – owners or charterers of [the Vessels]…”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Skaugen’s 1st affidavit at p 695. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The plaintiffs assert on affidavit that Somargas I transferred its ownership in the Vessels as well as all its assets and liabilities to Somargas II in or around February 2011; and Somargas II was successor to the business of Somargas. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendants point out that the plaintiffs have never had any claims vested in them in their own capacity; cannot claim for reflective loss; have not adduced any evidence that Somargas Cayman or Vintergas have assigned any chose of action and the mere transfer of physical property does not transfer the chose of action in respect thereof; nor any evidence that Somargas I had assigned any claims to Somargas II. While Somargas II was a previous owner, it is inconceivable for Somargas II to have taken ownership in reliance on any of the purported representations made by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I preface by analysing the conflicts of law issues thrown up by the assignments. The plaintiffs neither pleaded nor led any evidence on the content of any foreign law. The defendants have not of course filed their defences, but they have in their submissions pointed out that the plaintiffs have not shown that the assignments were effective under their proper laws. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The defendants’ submissions in this regard are simplistic. There are two choice of law rules applicable. The first is that the assignability of a cause of action is governed either by the law which governs that cause of action or the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span>. In the leading case of <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Corp v Credit Suisse</span> [1982] AC 679 (“<span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span>”), the House of Lords applied English law to determine the issue of assignability, but it is unclear if English law was applied <span class="font-italic">qua lex fori </span>or the law of the cause of action. I note that an Australian case, <span class="font-italic">Salfinger</span><span class="font-italic"> v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) </span>[2007] FCA 1532, has construed <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as standing for the latter, but I need not decide the point because Singapore law is both the <span class="font-italic">lex fori </span>and the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> causae</span> (see [47] and [87] below). The second is that the intrinsic validity of an assignment is determined by the proper law of the assignment (<span class="font-italic">Republica</span><span class="font-italic"> de Guatemala v Nunez </span>[1927] 1 KB 669). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In any event the defendants have not adduced any evidence of the content of any foreign law; this brings the presumption of similarity into play. There is a distinction between the rule of pleading that the pleading of foreign law is voluntary and the rule of evidence that where the content of foreign law is not proved or not sufficiently proved it is presumed to be similar to the substantive <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span> (implicit in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60] and [63]; see also Tan Yock Lin, “Rationalising and Simplifying the Presumption of Similarity of Laws” (2016) 28 SAcLJ 172 particularly at para 1). Therefore it is the second rule – the rule of evidence – that is at play here. As the authorities stand it is clear that a defendant who raises the spectre of foreign law must “prove the difference” (<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61]); there is a “presumption that unless the contrary be proved the general law of a foreign country is the same as the [<span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span>]” (<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Parchim </span>[1918] AC 157 at 161). It is incumbent on the defendants, having raised foreign law, to prove the content thereof. Not having done so, I am impelled to presume that the content of foreign law is identical to that of Singapore law.  Furthermore I note that the plaintiffs have not been accorded the opportunity of adducing expert evidence with respect to the content of any foreign law on this issue and if the presumption of similarity were not applicable I would have adjourned the matter to allow the plaintiff to adduce the said evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 A “good arguable case” (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>at [14]) entails one side having “a much better argument on the material available” but at the same time the court “must be concerned not even to appear to express some concluded view on the merits” (<span class="font-italic">Canada Trust Co v </span><span class="font-italic">Stolzenberg </span>[1998] 1 WLR 547 at 555F–G). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I emphasise “case”, and the word is reproduced in O 11 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court. The interlocutory battle over jurisdiction is fought over affidavits, and it would be neither proper nor opportune for a court to examine particular sub-aspects of a plaintiff’s case with a fine-tooth comb. A court ought to embark on a broad-brush enquiry into whether the plaintiff has made out a good arguable case that the claim falls within a particular limb of O 11. If a defendant contends that only certain isolated aspects of the plaintiff’s claim are questionable, this should not ordinarily be conflated with the assumption of long-arm jurisdiction, and should be dealt with after the jurisdictional stage through a summons to strike out specified paragraphs in the statement of claim. If this were not the position, the burden on the plaintiff at the jurisdictional stage would be immense, and a failure to defend a particular point would be tantamount to that point being struck out; proceedings would also be protracted due to plaintiffs being obliged to defend every single point for fear that a particular point may turn out to be crucial later. This clearly contradicts the general principle that a court cannot express a concluded view on the merits (<span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Such is the case here. What is clear and beyond dispute is that Somargas II was from February 2011 to April 2013 direct owners of all the six Vessels and is currently the bareboat charterer of two; and Somargas II was one of the parties to the assignment agreement which purported to assign claims to Skaugen Singapore. On the broad point of whether Somargas I did indeed assign its claims (from before Somargas II was direct owner) to Somargas II, the defendants make much of the lack of documentary evidence. But the lack of documentary evidence at this stage is not <span class="font-italic">ipso jure </span>fatal. It is true that a statutory assignment must be in writing (s 4(8) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)) but an equitable assignment does not. There does not even need to be an agreement between the assignor and assignee: an equitable assignment need take no particular form and equity has always looked to the intent rather than the form (<span class="font-italic">Coulter v Chief Constable of Dorset Police </span>[2004] 1 WLR 1425 at [12]). All that is needed is a sufficient expression of an intention to assign (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>) and conduct may be adequate evidence of such an intention (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, Damayanti Kantilal Doshi v Indian Bank </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 851, cited in Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">Personal Property </span>(Academy Publishing, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Yock Lin</span>”) at para 18.047). The defendants submit that the transfer of physical property does not transfer the chose of action in respect thereof, and cited Marcus Smith QC &amp; Nico Leslie, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Assignment </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2013) in support. But the particular paragraph relied upon (para 2.72) was cited out of context and is reproduced here:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is possible to describe a chose of action in a single sentence: a chose in action ‘describes all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession’. It follows that because the rights in a chose cannot be enforced by taking physical possession, the essence of a chose in action is that is a right or interest in an intangible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The paragraph was concerned with defining what a chose of <span class="font-italic">action</span> is (as opposed to a chose in possession: see also <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Yock Lin </span>at para 01.11). Indeed as conduct may be adequate evidence of an intention to assign, the fact of transfer may be sufficient to ground an inference that Somargas I did intend to assign its claims to Somargas II. Morits Skaugen did aver that all assets and liabilities – not just the physical Vessels – were transferred from Somargas I to Somargas II, and it was the understanding that Somargas II would thereafter operate or continue the business interests of Somargas I. The defendants do not raise any evidence to contradict this. It would have been unlikely for Somargas I to have been liquidated in December 2011 without ensuring that all valuable assets were transferred or otherwise assigned to Somargas II, especially as MAN Germany had issued a press release in May 2011 informing the public at large about possible irregularities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I do however note that there is some doubt over the claims post-April 2013. Three of the Vessels were transferred to GATX-related subsidiaries; one has since been sold to SGPC1 (which is 35% owned by Skaugen Marine); and the remaining two were sold but the purchasers were not identified. With respect to the GATX-related subsidiaries there was no mention of GATX Corporation acting on their behalf when the Claims Transfer Agreement was entered into in June 2014. The three subsidiaries which are the current owners of three of the Vessels have written on 25 February 2016 that they did indeed authorise GATX Corporation but this is almost two years after the fact. There is also neither any averment nor indication that SGPC1, owner of one Vessel, assigned its claim to the plaintiffs. But I have already stated that a court ought to take a broad-brush approach and not be bogged down in minute points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I also hold that the purported assignments are not void due to maintenance or champerty. This is because there is a well-recognised exception, namely, a genuine and legitimate commercial interest in the assignment of the right to litigate (<span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Corp v Credit Suisse </span>[1982] AC 679).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I therefore conclude that the plaintiffs have shown a good arguable case that they do have the requisite <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What is the applicable law?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This is an issue which must be determined before O 11 is considered because of the double actionability rule – the (alleged) wrong must be actionable not only under the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span> but also the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>(<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”) at [53]; but see also [93] below); but subject to the exception that the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span>, <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>, or a third law may solely apply if the <span class="font-italic">lex fori </span>and/or <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>are purely fortuitous and the application of either or both would result in injustice and unfairness (“the flexible exception”) (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [58]). As an aside, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>is literally Latin for the law of the place where the wrong was committed (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The plaintiffs and defendants disagreed on where the location of the tort was in the context of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>), that is, whether the claim is founded on a cause of action arising in Singapore, and repeated much the same arguments in the context of the applicable <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. The parties were agreed as to the test to be applied, but the plaintiffs submitted that this is Germany and German law; the defendants submitted that this is Singapore and Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The plaintiffs have, in their statement of claim, pleaded particulars of the torts of fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. I pause to note that, under the common law rules of conflict of laws, the identification of the place where the tort occurred is an issue that is governed by the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori </span>(<span class="font-italic">Macmillan </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No 3)</span> [1996] 1 WLR 387 at 392C); and it cannot be otherwise because the forum cannot apply a foreign law that has yet to be identified.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The test for where a misrepresentation has occurred is set out in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The general test for where a tort has occurred is looking back at the events constituting the tort and asking where in substance the cause of action arose (“the substance test”) (at [90], citing <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co (</span><span class="font-italic">Biochemicals) Ltd v Laura Anne Thompson</span> [1971] AC 458 at 468);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This is crystallised into a more certain rule for some torts in some circumstances. For misrepresentations, the place of the tort is in general the place where the representation is received and acted upon (at [91], citing <span class="font-italic">Cordoba Shipping Co Ltd v National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey</span> <span class="font-italic">(The “</span><span class="font-italic">Albaforth”)</span> [1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Albaforth</span>”) at 92);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the misrepresentation occurred in one jurisdiction to an unspecified class of persons and was received and relied upon in a second jurisdiction, the place of the tort is the former (at [91], citing <span class="font-italic">Cordova Land Co Ltd v Victor Brothers </span><span class="font-italic">Inc</span> [1966] 1 WLR 793 (“<span class="font-italic">Cordova </span><span class="font-italic">Land</span>”) at 801).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where receipt and reliance occur in different jurisdictions, the court must fall back on the substance test (at [93] and [94]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It may be argued that the circumstances fall within the rule in <span class="font-italic">Cordova Land</span>. But there are insuperable difficulties in ascertaining the exact location where reliance occurred. For instance it was Skaugen Norway that acted on behalf of Somargas Cayman and Vintergas initially in selecting the MAN engines – did reliance take place in Norway, where Skaugen Norway was incorporated, or did reliance take place in the Cayman Islands where Somargas Cayman and Vintergas were incorporated? Furthermore the reliance comprises not only the initial selection of engines but also the use of the ships equipped with the engines (see [79] below), and it is impossible to point to one location where the ships were used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 There is also some evidence that receipt and reliance occurred in different jurisdictions with respect to the FAT results. The documentary evidence discloses that representatives from “Skaugen” (it is unclear which Skaugen entity) were present at three FATs and representatives from Skaugen-related entities were present at the other three FATs. The FAT results were therefore received in Germany. However none of the pleaded acts of reliance took place in Germany. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I am therefore impelled to apply the substance test, and in this regard I stress that the entire point of the adoption of the substance test is avoiding the “mechanical solution involved in an outright choice between the place of acting and the place of harm” (<span class="font-italic">Dicey and</span><span class="font-italic"> Morris on the Conflict of Laws </span>vol 2 (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, 11th ed, 1987) (“<span class="font-italic">Dicey and Morris</span>”) at p 1387).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I have already dealt with the difficulty of pinpointing an exact location whereupon reliance occurred (at [51] above). It is also difficult to pinpoint a definitive location where receipt occurred. The Fuel Information System document was received by the Chinese shipbuilders and then transmitted to Skaugen Norway. Does receipt refer to the place where the misrepresentation was initially received by an intermediary, in which case receipt was in China, or the place where the misrepresentation was eventually transmitted to, in which case receipt was in Norway? These difficulties are compounded where what is essentially the same representation is contained and repeated in three documents, with each document being received separately. It is impossible to point to <span class="font-italic">the </span>place of receipt when the PPM was received in one of Norway or Denmark (the parties disagree on this); the FSI was received in China or Norway; and the FAT results were received in Germany. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Amid the miasma of uncertain connections with respect to receipt and reliance there remains one constant: all the purported representations were made by MAN Germany; the FATs took place in Germany; and the PPM, FSI and FAT results were authored in Germany, all of which essentially made and mutually reinforced the misrepresentation that fuel consumption was lower than what the engines actually consumed. Looking back on the series of events constituting the tort, the cause of action in substance arose in Germany. German law is the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I add that it would not be justified for me to analyse the misrepresentations on a document-by-document basis. This is wholly unsupported by the authorities. “Where a number of statements form a single representation because they are connected by express reference or identity of subject-matter, they must be considered together to ascertain whether their joint effect is a true or false representation” (Spencer Bower, Turner &amp; Handley, <span class="font-italic">Actionable Misrepresentation</span> (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 2000) (“<span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower</span>”) at para 93). This is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>for what is essentially a single representation that is repeated across three documents, and whereupon acts of reliance cannot be cleanly disentangled and attributed to individual documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Another potential counterargument is that the tort of misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or negligent, is complete only when acted upon (<span class="font-italic">Briess</span><span class="font-italic"> v Woolley </span>[1954] AC 333 at 353; <span class="font-italic">Goldrich</span><span class="font-italic"> Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 990 (“<span class="font-italic">Goldrich</span>”) at [41]); and because various entities acted upon the misrepresentation at various times, each instance of reliance by each entity must be analysed separately, and <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Albaforth </span>must apply to each aforesaid instance, namely that the place of the tort is where the representation is received and acted upon (“the separate tort thesis”). The plaintiff did not rely on the separate tort thesis explicitly, but argued that the place of the tort must be taken to be in Singapore because the Vessels were transferred to and continue to be owned by Singapore entities, continue to be registered and sail under the Singapore flag; and damage arising from excess fuel consumption is suffered in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There is no authority that the separate tort thesis is applicable in general to all torts (depending on when the tort in question is taken to be complete) or in particular to the tort of misrepresentation. The only tort that the thesis applies to is defamation, whereby each instance of publication gives rise to a separate tort (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Hsien Loong</span>”) at [34] and [35], in turn citing <span class="font-italic">Berezovsky</span><span class="font-italic"> v Michaels</span> [2000] 1 WLR 1004 (“<span class="font-italic">Berezovsky</span>”) at 1002–1003). But publication is quantitative in a way that reliance is not. If the same defamatory article is published 500 times in Malaysia and 500 times in Singapore, it is easy to conclude that 500 torts have occurred in Singapore and 500 in Malaysia. Acts upon representations cannot and should not be counted in the same way. Take the simple case of a seller misrepresenting that his goods are of a better quality than they turn out to be. The buyer acts upon that misrepresentation by entering into a contract with the seller in Singapore stipulating that payments are to be made in two tranches, and thereafter remitting funds situated in Swiss bank account for the first tranche and funds situated in a Hong Kong bank account for the second tranche. It would be contrived to state that three torts have occurred. On the instant facts, these difficulties are exacerbated by the plaintiffs acting upon the misrepresentations through the use of the Vessels (see also [79] below), which consume fuel at a higher rate than that represented. Is a court to count each trip taken by each of the Vessels as a separate tort? What should be construed as a trip?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Quite apart from the artificiality and difficulty in counting distinct torts, allowing a plaintiff to avail himself of the separate tort thesis would undermine the <span class="font-italic">raison </span><span class="font-italic">d’etre </span>of our jurisdictional rules as to when a defendant outside of the jurisdiction may be sued in Singapore. The entire point of these jurisdictional rules is the recognition that a foreigner should not easily be put to the inconvenience and annoyance of being brought to contest his rights in Singapore (see [28] above). A plaintiff, defamed on an Internet blog, as a starting point will be able to claim in defamation in the Singapore courts so long as if he can show that the article was downloaded and accessed once in Singapore, and he confines himself to claiming for that one publication. If the article has been published a thousand times in Malaysia but only once in Singapore, recourse may of course be had to the doctrine of abuse of process (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Hsien Loong </span>at [30]); but the doctrine is one of last resort, and if the root of the problem is the separate tort thesis then it would surely be simpler to not apply the thesis in the first place. This is exactly what was done in England after <span class="font-italic">Berezovsky</span> was handed down by the House of Lords. The separate tort thesis has been overruled legislatively in England by s 8 of the Defamation Act 2013 (c 26); this was passed partly in response to criticism that the English courts were becoming the preferred location for defamation actions (Joint Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill, <span class="font-italic">Draft Defamation Bill: Report </span>(HL Paper 203; HC 930-I, 19 October 2011 at paras 54–56). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Indeed the separate court thesis was not applied by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>. The first appellant sent a letter of offer via email to the respondent, which contained a representation that the first appellant had a high grade iron ore reserve amounting to one million tonnes. The respondent acted upon the representation twice, by remitting funds from India and conducting drilling works in Indonesia. The court applied the substance test and concluded that the “place of the <span class="font-italic">tort </span>was Indonesia” (emphasis added), thereby holding that one tort governed by Indonesian law arose. Significantly, the court did not hold that two torts had arisen from the two acts of reliance, as this would have necessitated each tort being governed by its own <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I therefore decline to extend the separate tort thesis to misrepresentation; and particularly in the light of the different direction English law has taken, it may perhaps be opportune for a future Court of Appeal to relook the applicability of the separate tort thesis to defamation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I conclude this section by declining to apply the flexible exception. I do not see any unfairness or injustice that would be occasioned by the application of either Singapore law or German law; and <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>makes it clear that a Singapore court “must not be quick to apply the exception” (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Do the plaintiffs have a good arguable case that their claim satisfies one or more limbs of O 11?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiffs rely on O 11 rr 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i), 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>). I deal first with whether a tort has arisen before dealing with each of the above limbs <span class="font-italic">seriatim</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has a tort arisen?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In order to satisfy O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i), a plaintiff must show a good arguable case that he has a cause of action in tort (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>at [18]) and he would <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>satisfy the lower standard of there being a serious issue to be tried (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). The same must obtain for O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii). I note that the language is slightly different – (<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) refers to a claim “founded on a tort” whereas (<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) refers to “damage… caused by a tortious act or omission”. This is not a material difference. An act or omission can properly be described as being tortious only if a tort is actually made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lex fori</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The elements for fraudulent misrepresentation are: first, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct; second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff (restated, there must be inducement); third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>there must be reliance); fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing and fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true (<span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The elements for negligent misrepresentation are: first, the defendant must have made a false representation of fact; second, the representation induced actual reliance (see <span class="font-italic">e.g. </span><span class="font-italic">Fong Maun Yee v Yoong Weng Ho Robert </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 751 at [52]); third, the defendant must owe a duty of care; fourth, there must be a breach of that duty of care; and fifth the breach must have caused damage to the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I deal first with whether there were false representations of fact; this is an element common to both species of misrepresentation. The PPM and FSI represented that fuel consumption was at a certain level and the FAT results represented that fuel consumption was lower than that stated in the aforementioned two documents. MAN Germany then admitted in a press release that there were possible irregularities during handover of four-stroke marine diesel engines, in that it was possible to externally influence fuel consumption values. MAN Germany then wrote to Norgas Carriers AS and Skaugen Norway, admitting that three MAN engines were externally influenced in an improper manner during FATs. I note that all the six MAN engines were identically designed, and all were manufactured and tested in the same factory operated by MAN Germany; it is therefore highly probable that the fuel consumption values for the other three MAN engines were similarly tampered with. The plaintiffs have undoubtedly shown on a good arguable case basis that there were false representations of fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I turn to inducement and reliance, issues which the parties had devoted much time to. Both are common elements to both species of misrepresentation. I deal first with the events surrounding the initial acquisition of the Vessels. Skaugen Norway, acting on behalf of Somargas Cayman, selected MAN Engines for the first four shipbuilding contracts after receiving the PPM. Skaugen Norway, acting on behalf of Vintergas, then selected MAN Engines for the subsequent two shipbuilding contracts after receipt of the PPM and the Fuel Information System document. The six engines were tested prior to delivery in 2001 and 2002. The FAT results showed fuel consumption at certain levels, and Skaugen Norway accepted the engines. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 With respect to the PPM, the defendants argue that there was a disclaimer: “for concrete projects you will receive the latest editions in each case with our quotation specification or with the documents for order processing” and therefore the PPM did not contain any actionable misrepresentations. Taken in isolation this may be the case; but the PPM was followed up with the FSI which confirmed the fuel consumption levels in the former (see [5] and [7] above). Furthermore the FAT results that were allegedly tampered with showed fuel consumption levels below those in the PPM and FSI. Cumulatively the three documents made essentially the same representation that the MAN engines consumed fuel at or below a certain rate. The disclaimer <span class="font-italic">per se </span>does not get the plaintiffs very far (see also [71] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendants had another string to their bow, and argued that the FSI was provided to the Chinese shipbuilders for the purpose of enabling the Chinese shipbuilders to choose the correct components for the construction of the vessels. They place much weight on the proposition that an indirect recipient of a statement can only bring a claim in misrepresentation if it can be shown that the representor intended for him to have acted in reliance on the statement (see also [77] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I have no quarrel with the mentioned proposition but it is inapplicable to the instant facts simply because Skaugen Norway directly received the PPM and Somargas Cayman and Vintergas (for which Skaugen Norway was acting on behalf of and whose claims have been assigned to the plaintiffs) directly received FAT results, and indeed the defendants do not dispute this. With respect to the FATs, the documentary evidence discloses that representatives from “Skaugen” (it is unclear which Skaugen entity) were present at three FATs and representatives from Skaugen-related entities were present at the other three FATs. As I have mentioned the representations were such that they were essentially repeated across three documents, and the plaintiffs directly received two of them. What I do take issue with is the defendants’ implicit position that the misrepresentations as to fuel consumption must be analysed on a document-by-document basis (a point I made at [56] above and repeat here). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Furthermore misrepresentations are regarded as continuing until they are acted upon (<span class="font-italic">Briess</span><span class="font-italic"> v Woolley </span>[1954] AC 333). Looking at events holistically, the plaintiffs (or Somargas Cayman and Vintergas which had assigned their claims to the plaintiffs) acted on the misrepresentations not just by initiating the chain of contracts that led to the installation of MAN engines in the Vessels, but by adhering to and causing the Chinese shipbuilders to adhere those contracts all the way to fruition and ultimately accepting the MAN engines when they were delivered (instead of exercising their contractual right to reject the engines, see [75] below).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The misrepresentations as to fuel consumption were undoubtedly material. The fuel consumption of a marine diesel engine is one of its important attributes: “[m]ateriality may be so clear and the probability of inducement so great that actual inducement may be found with little or no other evidence” (<span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower</span> at para 127). Additionally fuel consumption was of enough importance to the plaintiffs that the shipbuilding contracts with the Chinese shipbuilders contained provisions that provided for certain consequences to follow if fuel consumption was higher than expected (nevertheless see [75] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I now analyse the events after delivery, particularly the transfers of ownership to various Skaugen-related entities. The defendants essentially argue that representations were not made directly to subsequent successors in title, and the successors could not have relied on the representations in taking ownership or possession of the vessel and it was never within the defendant’s reasonable contemplation that any successors would place any reliance. If at all only Somargas Cayman and Vintergas relied upon them; and the successors in title only took ownership because of corporate restructuring and not representations as to fuel consumption levels. The plaintiffs argue that misrepresentations do not have to be made directly; the defendants did intend for the misrepresentations to be received by successors in title; and the said successors did rely on the misrepresentations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The defendants argue that the six shipbuilding contracts contained clauses which limited the loss suffered if fuel consumption was higher than expected and therefore successors in title cannot claim for their losses. Clause 5 of article I of the initial four shipbuilding contracts between Skaugen Norway and the Chinese shipbuilders which stated that “the [shipbuilder] guarantees that the fuel oil consumption of the Main Engine is not to exceed the chosen Main Engine Supplier’s guaranteed specific fuel consumption…” Clause 3 of article III of the same spells out certain consequences if the fuel consumption “as determined by shop trial” (a clear reference to what in this judgment’s parlance is a FAT) was greater than certain percentages:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Percentage</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Consequence</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Contract price reduced by USD 90,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Between 3% and 5%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Contract price reduced by USD 30,000 for each additional percent above 3% (pro-rated fractionally)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">5% and above</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Contract price reduced by USD 200,000, or the buyer may reject the vessel and rescind</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I do not see how this assists the defendants. Firstly, the defendants are not privy to the contracts between the Chinese shipbuilders and either Skaugen Norway or Vintergas. Secondly, the clauses refer to fuel consumption “as determined by shop trial” and therefore implicitly assume the veracity of the FAT results. The clauses do not envisage the FAT results being tampered with and do not apply to losses flowing from such a scenario. Thirdly, assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo </span>that the defendants can avail themselves of clauses in shipbuilding contracts despite not being privy to them, the clauses are not exclusion clauses that purport to exclude or limit liability for fraud or negligence on the part of a third party engine manufacturer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The cases establish that the fact of a representation being made indirectly is not a bar, provided that the representation is made in the contemplation that the representation will continue in force and be acted on by that indirect representee (<span class="font-italic">Goldrich</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]). There is evidence that the defendants did not draw any distinctions between individual entities within the Skaugen Group, and knew that representations would be transmitted to and acted upon by those individual entities. There were indications right from the outset that Skaugen Norway would be acting on behalf of related entities. The first four shipbuilding contracts were novated by Skaugen Norway to Somargas Cayman prior to the Chinese shipbuilders entering into the first four supply contracts with MAN Germany; and it was Vintergas that entered into the subsequent two shipbuilding contracts. Despite this representatives from “Skaugen” were the ones who attended the FATs. Furthermore when MAN Germany wrote about the possible tampering, they wrote not just to the managers of the Vessels, but also directly to Skaugen Norway; and one letter dated 22 June 2012 even explicitly stated that “[a]ccording to our information you [Skaugen Norway] were the initial owner of the engines…” despite the initial owners being Somargas Cayman and Vintergas. Therefore the successors in title, so long as they are Skaugen-related entities, are indirect representees within the contemplation of the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Nonetheless the manner in which a representee acts upon a representation must also be within the contemplation of the representor. Thus in <span class="font-italic">William Peek v Gurney </span>(1873) LR 6 HL 377, a fraudulent share prospectus circulated to the public was calculated to induce reliance only in initial subscribers and not purchasers who had bought through the stock exchange; but in <span class="font-italic">Possfund</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Diamond </span>[1996] 1 WLR 1351, another case concerning a fraudulent prospectus, the court refused to strike out an action brought by aftermarket purchasers because there was expert evidence that the established purpose of a prospectus was no longer confined to inducing investors to become placees and extended to inducing the public to make aftermarket purchases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 However, a share in a company is not equivalent to a marine diesel engine. The former is an incorporeal chose in action (<span class="font-italic">Pacrim</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Keow Claire</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 141 at [20] or at least something incorporeal and <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> (<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Yock Lin </span>at para 19.002); the latter is a corporeal chattel. A distinction may have been drawn between initial subscribers and aftermarket purchasers of shares in companies; but it is doubtful if a similar distinction can or should be drawn between an initial purchaser and subsequent owners of marine diesel engines. A marine diesel engine is a corporeal object that is used to propel ships; and despite the defendants’ protestations to the contrary the utilisation of a marine diesel engine to propel ships is surely something that was within their contemplation. Indeed there is case authority that the use of a corporeal object that is the subject of a misrepresentation constitutes an act upon that misrepresentation. In <span class="font-italic">Langridge</span><span class="font-italic"> v Levy </span>(1837) 2 M &amp; W 519, the plaintiff’s father bought a gun from the defendant who fraudulently warranted the gun to have been manufactured by a reputable gun manufacturer and to be good, safe and secure. The plaintiff “used the gun, and thereby sustained the damage which is the subject of this complaint” (at 532); the defendant was held liable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The plaintiffs have therefore shown a good arguable case that they were induced to rely, and did rely on the defendants’ misrepresentations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It also goes without saying that the successors in title have suffered damage: either from having had to purchase more fuel, or from a diminution of the market value of the Vessels due to the now public knowledge of the actual higher fuel consumption levels. The appropriate measure of damages is of course not an issue that is before me.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I now analyse elements specific to each species of misrepresentation. For fraudulent misrepresentation the plaintiffs must also show that the representation must be made with the knowledge that it is false or in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true. MAN Germany has admitted that there were indications that the fuel consumption values of three engines were “externally influenced in an improper manner during [FATs]” (at [14] above). It appears that MAN Germany had systematically tampered with FAT results, not only for the six engines that are the subject of this suit but for a plethora of other engines, as evidenced by the May 2011 press release and the subsequent criminal proceedings whereby MAN Germany was fined 8.2 million euros. The plaintiffs certainly have a good arguable case in this regard. Therefore the plaintiffs have shown, on a good arguable basis, that all the elements for fraudulent misrepresentation have been met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I turn to negligent misrepresentation. It is well established that a manufacturer owes a duty of care to end users (<span class="font-italic">Donoghue v Stevenson </span>[1932] AC 562). It is factually foreseeable that end users will be harmed if the fuel consumption of a marine diesel engine is represented to be less than what it actually is; there is sufficient proximity because first, the defendants possessed greater knowledge of its own products; second, the plaintiffs were in a position of vulnerability because the defendants were the ones with the requisite skill to conduct the FATs and were in full control of the whole testing process; and third the plaintiffs were actually present during the testing process and the defendants knew full well that Skaugen entities would be the end users of the MAN engines. There are no policy considerations which militate against the imposition of a duty of care. There were obviously breaches of this duty of care, in that the fuel consumption values represented were inaccurate. Therefore the plaintiffs have shown, on a good arguable basis, that all the elements for negligent misrepresentation have been met. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lex loci delicti</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I turn to actionability under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. Both the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts agree that the plaintiffs have a claim under §826 of the German Civil Code (“BGB”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person who, in a manner contrary to public policy, intentionally inflicts damage on another person is liable to the other person to make compensation for the damage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There are essentially two elements: the defendants intentionally inflicted damage; and the intentional infliction of damage must be <span class="font-italic">contra </span><span class="font-italic">bonos mores</span>, or in a manner contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I had earlier held that the misrepresentations were intended to induce and did induce reliance (principally at [73] and [77]–[80]). This corresponds with damage being inflicted intentionally. I had also earlier held that damage was actually suffered (at [72] and [81])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I turn to the requirement of <span class="font-italic">contra </span><span class="font-italic">bonos mores</span>. The experts are divided on this. The defendants’ expert, Prof Stephan Lorenz, says that in determining whether an act is <span class="font-italic">contra </span><span class="font-italic">bonos mores</span>, all the circumstances must be analysed, but nonetheless case law has held that this requirement is satisfied if an injurer acts recklessly or unconscionably; the plaintiffs’ expert, Dr Nadine Elisabeth Herrmann, says that a court will analyse whether the behaviour is reprehensible, as may be evidenced by the objectives pursued or means used, the attitude exposed or the consequences incurred. The defendants do not press this point, and correctly so: this requirement is met regardless of which standard is adopted; the defendants had tampered with FAT results, and represented fuel consumption levels to be lower than their actual levels. I find that the plaintiffs have shown on a good arguable basis that this element has been met.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The issue of limitation under German law also arises. Under s 3 of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act (Cap 111A, 2013 Rev Ed), a Singapore court shall apply the limitation periods of the <span class="font-italic">lex causae </span>(and Singapore limitation law shall not apply). Section 3(2) of the same makes it clear that this is so even where the foreign law falls to be considered for the purpose of actionability; this is a clear reference to the double actionability rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Prof Lorenz first relies on the standard limitation period of three years (§195 of the BGB). But I agree with Dr Herrmann, who pointed out that this only runs when the creditor has obtained knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the identity of the obligor, or would have obtained such knowledge if he had not shown gross negligence (§199(1) of the BGB). On the facts this suit was filed in the Singapore High Court on 28 January 2015. MAN Germany wrote to Skaugen Norway about indications of improper external influence on 22 June 2012; and before this MAN Germany wrote to Skaugen Norway on 31 January 2012 about the possibility of external influence. The suit was filed within three years of both dates. I do not consider that time should start running from the May 2011 press release, because the press release was not directed specifically at Skaugen Norway and did not identify any particular engines.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Prof Lorenz and Dr Herrmann both agree that there is a long-stop limitation period of ten years regardless of the knowledge of the plaintiff (§199(3) of the BGB). Dr Herrmann points out that it is possible for defendants to waive the right to plead a limitation defence, and that MAN Germany did waive such a right: until 31 December 2013 in one letter; 31 December 2014 in a second letter; and 31 March 2015 in a third. This suit was filed on 28 January 2015. Prof Lorenz does not comment on this, presumably because these waivers were not brought to his attention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I find that these waivers are effective with respect to both the standard limitation (at [88]) and long-stop limitation (at [89]). Therefore the claim is actionable under German law, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 There remain three loose ends to tie up.  Firstly, the experts were at odds as to whether the plaintiffs had a claim under §823(2) and §263 of the BGB. I need not decide this point because I have already found that the plaintiffs have a good arguable claim under §826 of the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Second, both experts agreed that there was a defence under §831 of the BGB, whereby liability in damages would not apply if an employer-principal shows that he has exercised reasonable care in selecting and supervising an employee-agent. Prof Lorenz did not come to a concluded view on this and conceded that MAN Germany would “have to establish that all operating procedures are managed in a way that guarantees continuous monitoring of all employees”. Dr Herrmann said that she is not currently aware of facts that could allow the defendants to invoke this defence. I agree with Dr Herrmann – the systematic and repeated tampering of FAT results suggests that, at the very least, upper management had acquiesced to a culture that allowed such tampering to happen. I find, on a good arguable case basis, that the §831 defence is not applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thirdly, it does not appear that the plaintiffs have a claim in German law under something analogous to the common law tort of negligence. This is not a barrier. Lord Wilberforce, in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Boys v Chaplin </span>[1971] AC 356 (at 389F), held that civil liability under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>is a condition for actionability under the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I would, therefore, restate the basic rule of English law with regard to foreign torts as requiring actionability as a tort according to English law, subject to the condition that civil liability in respect of the relevant claim exists as between the actual parties under the law of the foreign country where the act was done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage was cited with approval in the subsequent Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Coupland</span><span class="font-italic"> v Arabian Gulf Oil </span>[1983] 1 WLR 1136 (at 1146C) and the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA </span>[1995] 1 AC 190 (at 199D). I agree. The “double actionability” rule is a misnomer insofar as the label suggests that an action is governed by two different laws. The true position is that the <span class="font-italic">lex fori </span>is applied to the extent that it is congruent with the rights available under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 This reading of Lord Wilberforce is supported by the context. <span class="font-italic">Boys v Chaplin </span>overruled <span class="font-italic">Machado v </span><span class="font-italic">Fontes </span>[1897] 2 QB 231 which had held criminal liability under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>would be sufficient, and it was in that context that a majority of the House of Lords required civil liability. There is no indication that civil liability entails correspondence. It must also be significant that the majority referred to <span class="font-italic">civil </span>liability as opposed to tortious liability. <span class="font-italic">Dicey and Morris </span>took this to mean that “[i]t is sufficient if, by [the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>] his liability to pay damages is contractual, quasi-contractual, quasi-delictual, proprietary or <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span>” (at p 1372). The position is surely <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>where the claim is actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> loci delicti </span>as a delict. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Thus if the plaintiffs have an actionable civil claim under German law, the condition for the actionability of Singapore law would have been met and they would be able to claim in both fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">O 11 r 1(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">f</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">i)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The plaintiffs argue that the requirement of an act or omission occurring in Singapore is met because they have relied upon the misrepresentations in Singapore. The defendants argue that only the defendant’s acts or omissions are relevant to the enquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I agree with the defendants. The Singapore Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>stated in no uncertain terms that the commission of the constituent act or omission is by the defendant (at [18]). The English Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Metall</span><span class="font-italic"> und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc </span>[1990] 1 QB 391 (“<span class="font-italic">Metall</span><span class="font-italic"> und Rohstoff</span>”), in interpreting “an act committed within the jurisdiction” of Ord 11 r 1(1)(f) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (SI 1965 No 776) (UK) (“RSC”) held that the acts must be those of the putative defendant (at 437G). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Indeed the facts of <span class="font-italic">Newsat</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Limited v Zani </span>[2006] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 707 are directly on point. The claimants were incorporated to exploit an investment opportunity in relation to an orbital satellite slot owned by the Seychelles Republic, and during the course of a meeting, the defendant made various representations to the effect that the filing relating to the Seychelles slot had been properly made on the basis of true and accurate information and were not open to challenge. The claimants sued for fraudulent misrepresentation and attempted to rely on r 6.20(8)(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (that is, a claim in tort “where the damage sustained resulted from an act committed within the jurisdiction” and one of the successor provisions to RSC Ord 11 r 1(1)(f)), arguing that they had acted in reliance on the representations by making various investment decisions in London, thereby incurring significant wasted expenditure. The court cited <span class="font-italic">Metall</span><span class="font-italic"> und Rohstoff </span>with approval (at [35]) and held that the acts must be those of the defendant (at [45]); proceedings were therefore set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The plaintiffs therefore cannot rely on O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i). The defendant-centricness of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) is any case counter-balanced by O 11 r(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii), which is plaintiff-centric (a point also made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ABCI v BFT </span>[2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 146 at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">O 11 r 1(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">f</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)(i</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">i)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The defendants argue that only direct injury or damage is relevant, and the claim must be in respect of recoverable and quantifiable losses for damage or injury suffered; and the plaintiffs have admitted to the Oslo Conciliation Board that damages and losses were suffered in Norway.

This is for three reasons. Firstly RSC Ord 11 r 1(1)(f) and CPR r 6.20(8)(a) are more restrictive than O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) of our Rules of Court and do not explicitly allow for <span class="font-italic">ex juris </span>service if damage is only partially sustained in the forum. The restrictiveness of the English provisions suggests that the connection to England must be strong, and readily grounds the inference that damage must be direct. Secondly a clean line in the sand cannot be drawn between direct and indirect damage. The test for remoteness in tort was at one point in time predicated on directness (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Polemis</span> [1921] 3 KB 560) but this was <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> overruled in the <span class="font-italic">Wagon Mound (No 1) </span>[1961] AC 388 <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>because it was difficult for one to distinguish between the direct and indirect (at 426). I illustrate – if a man is knocked down in Johor Bahru but hospitalised in Singapore, is the damage arising from the hospitalisation direct or indirect? Thirdly, insofar as directness is a control mechanism that is a thinly-veiled value judgment on whether a Singapore court ought to assume jurisdiction, it would be preferable for a court to transparently weigh the competing considerations. In this respect it is already incumbent on a court to consider if Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>when considering whether to assume jurisdiction – and if the damage sustained could be said to be “indirect”, this would likely correlate with or be a significant factor contributing to the finding that Singapore is not the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. Briggs agrees: “the correct approach is, in practice, not to be too clever or analytical… but to rely on the principle of <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>to screen out those cases in which the damage connection with [the forum] is too weak or tenuous to justify service out” (Adrian Briggs, <span class="font-italic">Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments </span>(Informa Law, 6th ed, 2015) at p 486).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 A plaintiff invoking O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) is in generally not restricted to only claiming damage suffered in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2013 Reissue) at para 75.051). Nonetheless at least a part of the damage must be suffered in Singapore, and case law requires this damage to be significant<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, Metall und Rohstoff </span>at 437D and <span class="font-italic">Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia </span>[2005] QB 699 (“<span class="font-italic">Jones</span>”) at [29]). I had earlier held that the separate tort thesis does not apply to misrepresentation (see [57]–[61] above); a plaintiff therefore cannot contend that multiple torts have arisen and significant damage has been suffered in Singapore in respect of some of those torts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The requirement of some significant damage being suffered in Singapore is amply met on the facts. Somargas II, a Singapore subsidiary, was the direct owner of all the Vessels between February 2011 and April 2013. It is true that it is not enough to merely show that a company has its seat in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">The Eras </span><span class="font-italic">Eil Actions </span>[1992] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 570 at 591), but Somargas II suffered damage by operating Vessels which consumed fuel at a higher than represented rate, and once this became public knowledge, diminution in the market value of the Vessels.  Even after April 2013, three GATX-related entities, incorporated in Singapore, continue to own three of the Vessels to date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I therefore conclude that the plaintiffs have shown a good arguable case that O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) is satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Would the SICC have jurisdiction for the purposes of applying </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-weight-bold">?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I restate the legislatively prescribed requirements for transfer.

O 110 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) invokes the concept of a place of business. The phrase “place of business” has been defined to literally mean the place at which that party carries out business at the relevant time (O 110 r 1(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i)) or where a party carries out business in multiple places, the place with the closest relationship to subject matter of the dispute at that time (O 110 r 1(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii)). O 110 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is disjunctive, and r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii)(A) is satisfied. I list the substantial obligations performed: the marine engines were manufactured and tested in Germany and delivered to the Chinese shipbuilders in China; the FAT results, the PPM and FSI were authored in Germany; and the FSI was delivered to the Chinese shipbuilders in China. All of the above is take place in states different from Norway and Singapore, the places of business of Skaugen Norway and Skaugen Singapore. Therefore the plaintiffs have their places of business in a different state from the state in which a substantial part of the obligations of the commercial relationship between the parties is to be performed. O 110 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii)(B) is also satisfied. I had earlier concluded that, on an application of the substance test, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>is German law (see [50]–[59] above, and [55] in particular). I repeat the same analysis, and hold that the subject matter of the dispute is most closely connected with Germany; and Norway and Singapore, the places of business of Skaugen Norway and Skaugen Singapore, are states different from Germany. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The claim is commercial in nature. O 110 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) makes it clear that a claim can be commercial regardless of whether it is contractual. The claim pertains to misrepresentations made in the course of the supply of marine diesel engines, which falls neatly within r 2(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i)(A), namely, a trade transaction for the supply or exchange of goods or services.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The parties do not seek any relief in the form of, or connected with, a prerogative order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 O 110 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Rules of Court imposes the requirement that it be more appropriate for the case to be heard in the SICC. It is clear that O 110 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) refers to appropriateness as a matter of internal allocation of jurisdiction and does not import appropriateness <span class="font-italic">à</span><span class="font-italic"> la Spiliada</span>. O 110 r 12 is entitled “Transfer of proceedings to or from Court”, and deals with transfers from the High Court to the SICC and vice versa; while O 110 r 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) also imposes the requirement of appropriateness for transfers from the SICC to the High Court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I consider the requirement of appropriateness to be a counterweight to the dichotomies of “international” and “commercial” in O 110 r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). O 110 r 1 defines “international” and “commercial” in very broad terms, with the result that both are easily satisfied. A case may satisfy the formal requirements of “international” and “commercial” and yet not be substantially so. Take, for example, a husband who, through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands for which he is the sole shareholder and director, contracts with another company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, for which his wife is the sole shareholder and director. The contract pertains to the acquisition of a valuable Singapore-incorporated subsidiary, wholly owned by the husband’s company, at a price markedly below market value, and the subsidiary is duly transferred to the wife’s company. The wife thereafter files for divorce. Amidst the spectre of ancillary matrimonial proceedings, the husband files suit in the Singapore High Court seeking to rescind the transfer of the subsidiary on the ground of undue influence. The formal requirements of “international” and “commercial” are met. But, as a matter of substance, this is a dispute between husband and wife relating to (quasi-)matrimonial property, and it would not be more appropriate for this dispute to be heard in the SICC. Cases of this ilk are precisely the sort that the requirement of appropriateness is met to filter out. The Report of the SICC Committee supports this reading of O 110 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii); the Committee recommended that the SICC be empowered to decline to admit clearly inappropriate cases, and gave the example of a matrimonial dispute (at para 28). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Therefore I hold that, where a potential transfer to the SICC from the High Court is concerned, a case is more appropriately heard in the SICC if the case is in substance both international and commercial in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 This dispute is undoubtedly, in substance, international and commercial in nature. For the former, the prime movers, Skaugen Norway and MAN Germany, are based in different states, and the MAN engines were supplied through the Chinese shipbuilders as intermediaries. With respect to the latter, there can be no denying that the supply of marine diesel engines was on arms-length commercial terms.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 O 110 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Rules of Court is also met. Under the Rules of Court it is not possible for a party to file a contested summons seeking a transfer of the case to the SICC; a summons for transfer can only be filed if all parties consent (O 110 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the Rules of Court). O 110 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) requires the High Court to have heard the parties; but there is no requirement for this hearing to be separate or specially convened. In practice related applications are routinely heard together in one summons (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>para 37A of the Supreme Court Practice Directions), or related summonses routinely fixed to be heard together. During the course of these proceedings, the plaintiffs first mooted the possibility of transfer, both through their written submissions and in oral argument; and this was rebutted orally by the defendants.  I thereafter also directed both parties to file further written submissions on the issues of <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi</span> and transfer. The parties have therefore been heard on the issue of transfer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I therefore hold that, for the purposes of considering if Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>, the requirements for transfer to the SICC are met. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is Singapore the forum conveniens?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 During oral arguments, the defendants confirmed that they were not relying on <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span><span class="font-italic"> Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1097 despite on-going parallel proceedings (see [15] above). I note that all the other proceedings pertained to different engines, save for the litigation in the Norwegian courts. Nonetheless the plaintiffs have said that the proceedings in Norway were commenced in order to prevent any potential claim there from being time-barred, and they fully intend to stay proceedings in Norway if the defendants’ instant applications are dismissed. I therefore apply conventional <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>principles. The burden lies on the plaintiffs to show that Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>at [71]–[75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The plaintiffs essentially argued that this was an international case with dispersed connections, and no other forum could be said to be more appropriate than Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Siemens </span>at [4]). The defendants contended that Germany or alternatively Norway is more appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>cited <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Albaforth </span>with approval for the proposition that the place where a tort occurred is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>the natural forum for determining the claim (at [35]). In <span class="font-italic">VTB Capital </span><span class="font-italic">plc v Nutritek International Corpn</span> [2013] 2 AC 337 (“<span class="font-italic">VTB Capital</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span>”), the Supreme Court squarely considered <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Albaforth</span> and essentially held that it was good law. The place of commission of a tort is a relevant start point, and if viewed in isolation, establishes on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis that place as the appropriate jurisdiction (at [51]). I henceforth refer to this as “the Albaforth principle”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>also stands for the separate proposition that a court is more adept at applying the law of its own jurisdiction than a foreign court, and this will result in savings in time and resources (at [42]). <span class="font-italic">VTB Capital </span><span class="font-italic">(SC) </span>similarly concluded that it is generally preferable that a case should be tried in the country whose law applies (at [46]). I henceforth refer to this as the “home advantage principle”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I do not propose to rehearse the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> and <span class="font-italic">VTB Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span>. Rather, I shall analyse how the continued vitality of the double actionability rule in Singapore would affect the application of the home advantage principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Singapore is an anomaly in this regard. Major common law jurisdictions have abolished the rule: Australia (by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Regie</span><span class="font-italic"> Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang </span>(2002) 210 CLR 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Renault v Zhang</span>”)); Canada (by the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Tolofson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Jensen</span> (1994) 120 DLR (4th) 289) and England (by Parliament via the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 (c 41) for all torts except defamation). The double actionability rule is also unknown to the civil law; civilian systems mostly apply the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> (C G J Morse, “Choice of Law in Tort: A Comparative Survey” (1984) 32 Am J Comp L 51).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The applicability of the double actionability rule in Singapore but not elsewhere could increase the weight of the home advantage principle. Let us assume that, on an application of Singapore private international law rules, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delic</span><span class="font-italic">ti </span>is the law of Cantonia and the flexible exception is not applicable. The private international law rules of Cantonia do not contain the double actionability rule and point towards the application of the substantive law of Cantonaia as the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> causae</span>. There would be tremendous cost and time savings for the dispute to be heard in Cantonia, not just because the Cantonia court would be applying Cantonian law, but also because the Singapore court would be grappling with both Singapore and Cantonian law.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I had earlier concluded that German law is the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. Both parties’ experts were asked for their opinion on the private international law rules of Germany, and both agreed that tort claims are governed by the law of the country in which the liable party has acted, subject to the choice of the injured party to opt for the law of the country in which the injury occurred (Art 40 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (“EGBGB”)). But under Art 41 of the EGBGB there is an overriding exception which obliges the court to apply the law of the country with the closer connection to the case than that applicable under Art 40 of the same. Both experts agreed that Germany was the country in which the liable party acted. However Prof Lorenz said that if Skaugen were to opt for the law of the country in which the injury occurred, the Art 41 exception would oblige German law to be applied, while Dr Herrmann said that it cannot be assumed that German law has a closer connection than Norwegian, Chinese or Singaporean law. I agree with Prof Lorenz that the defendant-sided connections pointing towards three or more jurisdictions are individually weaker than the plaintiff-sided connections pointing towards Germany (see also [51]–[55] above). I therefore conclude that if this dispute were to be tried in Germany, the German courts would apply German law.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I analyse availability. Prof Lorenz opines that a German court would assume jurisdiction over the claim against MAN Germany because MAN Germany is statutorily seated in Germany (Arts 4 and 63 of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012, commonly known as the recast Brussels I Regulation); and against MAN Norway because the claim against MAN Norway is closely connected to the claim against MAN Germany (Art 6 of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, commonly known as the new Lugano Convention). Dr Herrmann however points out that the new Lugano Convention contains the court first seised rule (Art 27), and because the plaintiffs have initiated proceedings in Norway, the German court would decline jurisdiction in favour of the Norwegian court. Prof Lorenz, in reply, argues that Art 27(1) only mandates a stay until the jurisdiction of the Norwegian courts is established, and the stay could be lifted if for any reason Norwegian proceedings end without a decision or a legally binding settlement. I note that the plaintiffs are in the driver seat for Norwegian proceedings and have indicated that they will stay those proceedings if the defendants’ applications before me are dismissed; it is well within the plaintiffs’ power to stay or discontinue proceedings in Norway and sue in Germany instead. The plaintiffs cannot assert unavailability if this unavailability is due to their own actions.  I agree with Prof Lorenz and conclude that Germany is an available forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126  The enquiry into whether Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>must take into account the likely issues in dispute (<span class="font-italic">Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd v CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 761 at [32]). These are likely to centre on <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> whether the claims of the successors in title were validly assigned; whether the defendants’ misrepresentations were made with the intention that they should be acted upon; whether the defendants had assumed responsibility or were otherwise proximate enough such that a duty of care arose; whether the defendants knew that the representations were false; whether and how the plaintiffs and successors in title had acted upon those misrepresentations; the quantum of the damage suffered by the plaintiffs, and whether this should be measured in terms of the diminution in the value of the Vessels and/or past and prospective fuel purchases in excess of the expected fuel consumption level and whether either or both are heads claimable under German law; and the content of German law, potential defences therein and their application to the facts, including whether the defendants’ actions were <span class="font-italic">contra </span><span class="font-italic">bonos mores</span>, whether the plaintiffs’ claim is time-barred and whether the §831 defence of reasonable care in selection and supervision of employees applies. As can be seen complex issues of both law and fact will arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Albaforth principle is applicable to the facts at hand, but I attribute less weight to this because determining the location of the tort was not a straightforward exercise; while Germany could be said to be the “location” of the tort on an application of the substance test, significant acts upon the misrepresentations occurred outside of Germany (see [50]–[61] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I attribute more weight to the home advantage principle. The defendants have proven that a German court will apply German law to the claim (see [125] above). It is true that the claim throws up complex issues of German law. Nonetheless the ordinarily greater cost, inconvenience and difficulty of a Singapore court applying German law will be considerably mitigated by the SICC empanelling International Judge(s) from civilian countries and determining German law on the basis of submissions rather than proof (O 110 r 25 of the Rules of Court); and to that end the parties may be represented by German counsel (s 36P of the Legal Profession Act). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 But this is only half of the equation: the double actionability rule obliges a Singapore court, including the SICC, to apply Singapore law and this falls exactly within the scenario painted at [123] above. Let us assume that the SICC grants an application allowing parties to submit on, rather than prove, foreign law since this is cheaper and more convenient. The parties would have had to engage two sets of lawyers, one German and the other Singaporean (O 110 r 25(2) of the Rules of Court requires all parties to be represented by counsel who are competent to submit on the relevant questions of foreign law). Needless to say, Singaporean counsel would have to go beyond being instructing solicitors, and will have to actively argue and submit on Singapore law. This is not dispute that is merely fact-centric – complex issues of fact, law, and mixed fact and law will arise (see [126] above). While there will be some overlap in the factual and legal issues, there remain contentious issues unique to each system of law – for instance, duty of care in the tort of negligence in Singapore law, and <span class="font-italic">contra </span><span class="font-italic">bonos mores </span>in German law. Fact-finding and argumentation would necessarily be more protracted. All in all there would be considerable cost and time savings for the claim to be tried in a German court that applies only German law.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Other factors do not displace the weight of the home advantage principle. Witness location is in favour of Germany: the <span class="font-italic">dramatis personae</span> and moving minds of MAN Germany and Skaugen Norway are based in Europe and it would be more convenient for the trial to be heard in Germany, where MAN Germany is based and which is closer to Norway where Skaugen Norway is based; but I place little weight on this factor because physical location is no longer a vital consideration (<span class="font-italic">Siemens </span>at [11]). Neither party has raised witness compellability as an issue (<span class="font-italic">cf</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid bin Abdul Manaf v Hii Yii Ann </span>[2016] SGHCR 1).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The defendants point out that the bulk of the documentary evidence is in Germany. Documentary evidence regarding the misrepresentations is plaintiff-centric and located in Germany, but documentary evidence regarding acts upon representations and damage is defendant-centric and located outside of Germany. This is a neutral factor. In any event not much weight can be placed on this factor because the availability of digitisation services obviates the need to physically ship documents across international borders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The defendants also submit that they will face data protection issues if the case were to proceed in Singapore. An Alexander Nijsen, the head of MAN Germany’s “Four-Stroke Marine” business unit for MAN engines, attests that MAN Germany has been advised that German data protection laws are applicable. International data transfers from a European Union country to Singapore requires special justification on a document-by-document basis in order to be considered legitimate and this would add considerably to the costs of litigation.

</div> I have no hesitation whatsoever in rejecting this submission due to want of proof. Nijsen is not a legally trained person and is in no position to advise on the content of German law, which in this court should ordinarily be proven by expert evidence (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Recreation</span>”) at [60]). He has neither cited any law nor exhibited any advice purportedly received; and at any rate even if any advice were to be exhibited I would place no weight on it because the mandatory requirements of O 40A r 3 have not been met (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61]–[88]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Lastly the plaintiffs argue that they have serious reservations on whether it will be accorded justice in the event that claims were to be heard in Germany. The plaintiffs have experienced substantial difficulty in Germany in attempting to obtain access to case files for the criminal proceedings against MAN Germany. An Augsburg Regional Court, on appeal, declined to grant access; Skaugen Norway has filed a Constitutional Complaint alleging due process violations on the part of the Augsburg courts, namely that it was denied sufficient time to make submissions and was denied access to various briefs filed by MAN Germany.

Lord Goff of Chieveley set out the two stages of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>in the context of defendants being served as of right, and whereby a defendant bears the burden of persuading the court that there is another available forum which is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>the appropriate forum, and if the court is so satisfied the burden shifts to plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in the forum (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>at 476D–F). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The two stages are only necessary in order to reverse the burden. If a defendant is served <span class="font-italic">ex juris</span> the burden rests on the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>at 480H). In <span class="font-italic">ex juris </span>cases, so long as the burden rests on the plaintiff throughout it does not matter if <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>is applied by a court at one go or in two stages. In practice, a plaintiff deploys all his <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>arguments at one go, because <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> hearings are not bifurcated: a court does not make an interim ruling that the plaintiff has failed to show that the forum is more appropriate, and then proceed to invite the plaintiff to show special circumstances.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I reject the plaintiffs’ argument that they will be denied justice. <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Abidin Daver </span>[1984] AC 398 required positive and cogent evidence of the alleged injustice (at 411D). This is not met on the case. The plaintiffs were denied discovery of documents in criminal proceedings, allegedly due to what the common law would classify as breaches of natural justice and from this base they mount an implicit attack on the German courts, saying that they will not be accorded justice in related civil proceedings. This simply does not follow. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I also reject the plaintiffs’ further argument that regard should be had to the difficulty of obtaining discovery in civil proceedings in Germany. Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>specifically said that a plaintiff may derive advantages, including a more complete procedure of discovery, but a court should not deterred from granting a stay because of the deprivation such advantages provided that a court is satisfied that substantial justice is done (at 482E–F). A common law court cannot sit in judgment over civil law procedure. Taken in isolation limited pre-trial discovery obligations may seem alien to common law eyes, but this is explained by two features unique to civil law systems. Firstly there is no strict dichotomy between trial and pre-trial; and there is also no strict dichotomy between discovering evidence and presenting it (John H Langbein, “The German Advantage in Civil Procedure” (1985) 52 U Chi L Rev 823 at p 826). Secondly civil law judges play an active inquisitorial role and are “responsible for eliciting relevant evidence” (Geoffrey C Hazard Jr, “Discovery and the Role of the Judge in Civil Law Jurisdictions” (1997) 73 Notre Dame L Rev 1017 at p 1019); indeed, party-led discovery is anathema and seen as a usurpation of judicial power (<span class="font-italic">ibid </span>at p 1022). As such the more limited discovery regime in civil law jurisdictions cannot be taken to be a juridical disadvantage for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Taking into account the establishment of the SICC, the plaintiffs have failed to show that Singapore is clearly the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>, because Germany is more appropriate than Singapore. I do not need to consider the defendants’ alternative submission that Norway is more appropriate than Singapore. Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that I cannot take the establishment of the SICC into account, Germany would <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>be more appropriate than Singapore because I would place even more weight on the home advantage principle: complex issues of German law would have to be resolved on the basis of expert evidence without the benefit of having a civil law judge on the coram.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Because Singapore is not the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, I grant the defendants’ applications to set aside service <span class="font-italic">ex juris </span>of the writ. I do not need to consider whether the case should be stayed on stay management principles. I shall hear the parties on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Coda – whither </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">and the double actionability rule</span><span class="font-weight-bold">?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 My judgment applies the existing paradigm to the facts. But the SICC is a paradigm shift in the field of dispute resolution, and raises the question writ large as to whether there ought to be concomitant paradigm shifts in <span class="font-italic">forum non conv</span><span class="font-italic">eniens</span> and the choice of law rules for tort. I have kept to the existing paradigm for two reasons: firstly the parties did not argue that a paradigm shift should occur, and it would have been a breach of natural justice for me to herald a paradigm shift; secondly the existing paradigm is deeply entrenched and the edifice of case law comprises many Court of Appeal decisions that are binding on the High Court. It is the Court of Appeal, the apex court of the land, that is ideally placed and indeed empowered to herald paradigm shifts (Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1994] 2 SLR 689). I make only brief comments.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">Forum non conveniens</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The Report of the SICC Committee posed the question of whether “the traditional <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test… remains modern and relevant to the SICC” (at para 27) but did not answer it and presumably left this to the courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I observe that <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>is increasingly inapplicable in England due to the advent of European Union law. Under the Brussels I Regulation and the Lugano Convention it is clear that an English court has no power to stay proceedings on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>grounds in favour of another EU member or Lugano Convention state (<span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins on the</span> <span class="font-italic">Conflict of Laws </span>vol 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th ed, 2012) at para 12-015), and the Court of Justice of the European Communities in <span class="font-italic">Owusu</span><span class="font-italic"> v Jackson </span>held that an English court which has been conferred jurisdiction under Art 2 of the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (commonly known as the Brussels Convention) did not have the power to stay proceedings on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>grounds in favour of a non-EU member. I also observe that Australia declined to follow <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>; the High Court of Australia, in <span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> v Manildra Flour Mills </span>(1990) 171 CLR 538 (“<span class="font-italic">Voth</span>”), held that the test was whether the local forum is clearly inappropriate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As a matter of principle it is seems incongruous that an international commercial court set up to cater to foreign parties and foreign laws (for the exact Parliamentary Debates quote see [29] above) would find itself hamstrung by rules on the assumption of long-arm jurisdiction that date back to laws promulgated in the 1800s (see Zhuang WenXiong, “<span class="font-italic">Burgundy</span>, The Bifurcation of Jurisdiction and Its Future Implications” (2015) 27 SAcLJ 222 at paras 6–8) which are rooted in outmoded conceptions of sovereignty as being tantamount to territorial control (see Alex Mills, “Rethinking Jurisdiction in International Law” (2014) 84(1) The British Yearbook of International Law 187 at pp 204–205). There is an ineluctable tension between the jurisdictional requirement of internationality (s 18D of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and O 110 r 7 of the Rules of Court) and the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test, which is concerned with the comparative appropriateness of Singapore as compared to an available foreign jurisdiction. I leave aside clear cases with no obvious centre of gravity and dispersed links to many jurisdictions, for which no foreign jurisdiction can be said to be more appropriate than Singapore. For penumbral cases, the stronger the links to a foreign country, the more likely that a claim is international; but also the more likely that the foreign jurisdiction will be found to be more appropriate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I note that where a case is commenced in the SICC, O 110 r 8 of the Rules of Court states that the SICC may decline to assume jurisdiction if it is “not appropriate for the action to be heard in the [SICC]”. O 110 r 8 refers to appropriateness as a matter of private international law and not internal allocation of jurisdiction, because the latter is governed by O 110 r 12. This is supported by O 110 r 8(2), which exhorts the SICC not to decline to assume jurisdiction solely on the ground that the dispute between the parties is connected to a jurisdiction other than Singapore if there is a written jurisdiction other than Singapore. The phrase “not appropriate” ostensibly obliges the SICC to apply the clearly inappropriate test of <span class="font-italic">Voth</span>, and not the clearly more appropriate test of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>. From this it is but a short leap to argue that, if a case meets the requirements for transfer from the High Court to the SICC, the High Court should apply the private international law rules of the SICC – that is, <span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>instead of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Double actionability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I had earlier already observed that Singapore appears to be one of the final frontiers in a Commonwealth that has by and large forsaken double actionability (see [122] above). The onerous and expensive requirement to potentially prove the actionability of one’s claim in two laws would likely deter plaintiffs with foreign tort claims from litigating in Singapore in general and the SICC in particular. This is manifestly at odds with the avowed goal of the SICC to cater to foreign parties and international disputes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147  The double actionability rule has been criticised. The Supreme Court of Canada, in <span class="font-italic">Tolofson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Jensen</span>, abolished double actionability and made the following comments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Phillips v Eyre </span>(1870) LR 6 QB 1, one of the early cases promulgating the double actionability rule, referred to actionability in England as a matter of jurisdiction and not choice of law (at [24]–[26]). <span class="font-italic">Machado v </span><span class="font-italic">Fontes </span>wrongly interpreted <span class="font-italic">Phillips v Eyre </span>as requiring actionability in England as a matter of choice of law (at [27]–[28);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) From the general principle that a state has exclusive jurisdiction within its own territories it is axiomatic that the law to be applied in torts is the law of the place where the activity occurred (at [43]). This has the advantage of certainty, ease of application and certainty ( at [44]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If a Canadian court, in adjudicating on wrongs committed in another country, were to apply Canadian law, the court would be defining the nature and consequences of an act done in another country – something that flies against the territoriality principle (at [47]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d)  The adoption of double actionability can be explained by Britain being a colonial power and the perception that British laws were superior to those of other lands, and the practical consideration that proof of laws of far-off countries would not have been easy (at [48]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The fact of a claim not being actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span> is better dealt with through <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>or the doctrine of public policy (at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 On a similar note, the High Court of Australia, in <span class="font-italic">Renault </span><span class="font-italic">v Zhang</span> abolished double actionability and the majority made the following comments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The application of the <span class="font-italic">lex fori </span>is originally rooted in the perception that tort is intimately connected with the criminal law, but today tort is about the expedient distribution of risk (at [46]–[47]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The application of the <span class="font-italic">lex fori </span>may also be seen as an expression of public policy considerations before the development of a body of case law, precluding, on public policy grounds, what otherwise would be a choice of foreign law as the <span class="font-italic">lex causae</span> (at [48]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To the extent that the first limb of the double actionability rule was intended to operate as a technique of forum control, the court should frankly recognise that the question is about public policy and confront directly the issues that this may present (at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Kirby J also said that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The rule upholding the law of the place of the wrong is that which commands almost universal contemporary allegiance (at [128]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The rules of private international law exist to fulfil foreign rights and duties, not destroy them (at [129]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The ordinary expectations of most parties are that the law of the place of the wrong will govern the rights and duties of the parties and this will conduce towards certainty, allow easier advice, and decrease the temptation to forum shop (at [130]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A choice of law rule that permits a plaintiff to pick and choose, according to the forum it selects, the law that would be applied, would derogate from the effective control of a given law area over those aspects of its law, and allow defendants to minimise exposure to risk (at [131]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I note that the latest Court of Appeal decision applying the double actionability rule, <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>, pre-dates the establishment of the SICC and counsel in that case had not argued for the abolishment of the double actionability rule. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 I conclude by observing that the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight </span>have filed summonses for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. These summonses are scheduled to be heard on 3 May 2016. <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight </span>throws up the issue of whether <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>ought to be applied differently or another test adopted altogether, albeit in the context of defendants, served as of right, applying to stay proceedings. Given this, and on the assumption that the plaintiffs intend to appeal, I encourage the parties to jointly request for an expedited appeal to a High Court Judge, and if there is a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, to apply for that further appeal to be heard at the same time as <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight </span>in the Court of Appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Zhuang WenXiong<br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lawrence Teh and Khoo Eu Shen (Rodyk &amp; Davidson) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Danny Ong, Yam Wern-Jhien and Ms Eunice Wong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendants;<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
