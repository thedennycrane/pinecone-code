I shall only refer to the salient features of the Accused’s criminal conduct that are relevant to the issue of sentencing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Brief facts leading up to the commission of the offences by the Accused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Accused is a male Chinese Singaporean who is 47 years old. The Accused was 42 years old and unemployed at the time of the offences. The victim is a 39-year-old female Chinese national (“the Victim”) who worked as a beautician at the time of the commission of the offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the early hours of 30 January 2017, the Accused unlawfully entered the residential unit of the Victim (“the Unit”) which is a private apartment (“the Apartment”) and raped the Victim. These offences were committed shortly after the Accused met the Victim for the first time at a KTV lounge located at Bugis Cube (“the KTV Lounge”) on the night of 29 January 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On the afternoon of 29 January 2017, before heading to the KTV Lounge, the Victim was celebrating Chinese New Year with her friends at the Unit and had consumed alcohol. Sometime around 10.00pm on the same day, the Victim and her friends decided to go for a karaoke session at the KTV Lounge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At the KTV Lounge, the Victim and her friends ordered more alcohol. At about 11.23pm, whilst the group was at the KTV Lounge, one of the Victim’s friends, Heng Kwok Hun, received a call from the Accused. The Accused, subsequently, joined the Victim and her friends at the KTV Lounge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Shortly after, the Victim collapsed from heavy intoxication and lay asleep on the couch at the KTV Lounge. As her friends could not wake her up when they were leaving, the Accused helped to carry the Victim out of the KTV Lounge. The Accused then offered to drive the Victim and her friends home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Accused drove first to the Apartment. As the Victim was completely intoxicated and unconscious, she had to be carried to the Unit by two of her friends. Shortly after, the Accused arrived at the Unit, and he helped the Victim’s two friends to put the Victim on her bed. The three of them then left the Unit. One of the Victim’s friends locked the main door and slipped the key underneath the main door.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Facts relating to the commission of the offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 After sending all the Victim’s friends home, the Accused returned to the Apartment alone. Along the way, the Accused had called the Victim on her handphone numerous times. There was, however, no response from the Victim. When the Accused arrived at the Apartment, he entered the side gate using the access code that he remembered earlier on when the Victim’s friends sent the Victim home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Accused then went up to the Unit and retrieved the key from underneath the Unit’s main door using a satay stick that he picked up along the way. The Accused then entered the Unit and went into the Victim’s bedroom. There, he undressed the Victim before molesting the Victim and sexually penetrated her vagina with his penis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Victim was awakened by the rape, and despite her state of intoxication, she asked the Accused to leave the Unit after ascertaining his identity. The Victim telephoned one of her friends to inform her that she was raped. The Victim also called the police to lodge a report that the Accused had raped her. Shortly after, the Accused was arrested.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">House-breaking by night to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Accused committed the offence of house-breaking by night to rape the Victim. This is an offence under s 457 of the Penal Code which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Lurking house-trespass by night or house-breaking by night in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">457.</span> Whoever commits lurking house-trespass by night or house-breaking by night, in order to commit any offence punishable with imprisonment, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if the offence intended to be committed is theft, the term of the imprisonment shall be not less than 2 years and not more than 14 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Further, prior to this case, the Accused had at least one antecedent of house-breaking by night to commit theft, for which he was convicted in the District Court on 9 March 2007 and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane (see [49] below). Accordingly, the Accused’s sentence under the House-breaking Charge would be enhanced pursuant to s 458A of the Penal Code, which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Punishment for subsequent offence under section 454 or 457</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">458A.</span>  Whoever, having been convicted of an offence under section 454, … 457 … commits an offence under section 454 or 457 shall be punished with caning in addition to the punishment prescribed for that offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Accordingly, the Accused is liable to be sentenced to both an imprisonment term which may extend to five years and an additional punishment of caning. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Rape Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 For the Rape Charge, the relevant punishment provisions are s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 375(2) of the Penal Code:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">375.</span>—(1)  Any<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> man who penetrates the vagina of a woman with his penis — </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) without her consent …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  (2)  Subject to subsection (3), a man who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, the Accused is liable to be sentenced to an imprisonment term of up to 20 years and shall also be liable to caning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The sentencing guideline framework for rape offences was laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”). In the application of the sentencing framework, a two-stage exercise is contemplated (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73(a)] and [73(c)]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Court has to ascertain which of the three sentencing bands the Accused’s rape offence falls within, having regard to the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific </span>factors (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, factors relating to the circumstances of the offence, such as the harm caused to the victim and the manner by which the offence was committed). Once the appropriate sentencing band has been identified, the Court derives an indicative starting point by determining precisely where within the range of sentences the present offence falls.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Court calibrates the appropriate sentence for the Accused by having regard to the <span class="font-italic">offender-specific </span>aggravating and mitigating<span class="font-italic"> </span>factors. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, cannot be the same factors which have already been taken into account in determining the categorisation of the offence. One of the factors which the Court should consider at this stage is the value of a plea of guilt (if any).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The sentencing bands under the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>sentencing framework are<span class="font-italic"> </span>summarised in the table below (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [73(b)]):</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Band</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Description</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentencing range</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center">1</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Cases with no or limited offence-specific aggravating factors</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">10 to 13 years’ imprisonment <br/>and 6 strokes of the cane</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Cases of a higher level of seriousness involving two or more offence-specific aggravating factors</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">13 to 17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Extremely serious cases owing to the number and intensity of offence-specific aggravating factors</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">17 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>further emphasised the need for the Court to clearly articulate the factors it has taken into consideration as well as the weight which it is placing on them. This consideration also applies to the second stage of the analysis, when the Court is calibrating the sentence from the indicative starting point and at the end of the sentencing process. The Court also has to consider the totality principle in sentencing (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [73(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Submissions on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s submission on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Prosecution seeks a total sentence of 16 to 20 years’ imprisonment and at least 15 to 16 strokes of the cane.

He committed an offence of theft for which he was fined $900.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Undeterred by his conviction in 1992, the Accused proceeded to commit a string of offences for which he was convicted on 25 May 1999 when he was 24 years old. This was just seven years after his previous conviction. Further, unlike his previous conviction which involved just a single offence of theft, the Accused’s convictions in 1999 covered a series of offences. These included two charges of theft as well as more serious offences, namely two charges of house-breaking by night and one charge of carrying an offensive weapon in public. In addition, one charge of house-breaking by night and one charge of criminal intimidation were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. A significant sentence of four years and nine months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was imposed on the Accused following his convictions in 1999. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Yet, the Accused did not learn his lesson after his convictions in 1999. Slightly less than eight years after his convictions in 1999, the Accused was once again convicted for a fresh set of offences on 9 March 2007 when he was 32 years old. Between his convictions in 1999 and his convictions in 2007, the Accused would have served his sentence of four years and nine months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for his convictions in 1999. Even after taking into account any possible remission he might have been given for good behaviour, what is patently clear is that the Accused proceeded to commit further property offences just a few years after his release from prison. In 2007, he was convicted of three charges of house-breaking by night. Two other charges of house-breaking by night were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. For two of the charges of house-breaking by night, the Accused was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane for each charge. For the third charge of house-breaking by night, he was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane. His total sentence in 2007, therefore, was a lengthy term of five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Despite the lengthy imprisonment term following his convictions in 2007, the Accused was once again hauled back to court for an offence of fraudulent possession of property, namely 11 female undergarments. He was convicted for this offence on 27 October 2014 when he was 40 years old. Upon his conviction, he was issued a 12-month Mandatory Treatment Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the present case, the Accused has been convicted of two very serious charges, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge. These offences were committed on 30 January 2017 when the Accused was 42 years old. This would have been slightly more than two years after his last conviction in October 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 What is abundantly clear from a careful scrutiny of the Accused’s criminal record is that the Accused is a recalcitrant person who has been committing property offences, among others, since 1992 when he was just 17 years old. Between 1992 and 2017, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the year of his first conviction and the year that he committed the present set of offences, the Accused has been sentenced to a total imprisonment term of nine years and nine months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. What this means is that the Accused has spent a significant part of a 25-year period from 1992 to 2017 in prison. Despite this significant period in prison, the Accused has not demonstrated any commitment to move away from a life of crime. On the contrary, the Accused has instead proceeded to commit two offences which are significantly more serious. The Rape Charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. The House-breaking Charge carries a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Accused has shown a complete disregard for the law. His antecedents show a consistent pattern of reoffending. More significantly, beyond the repeated nature of his reoffending, the Accused has also committed far more serious offences in the present case. In sentencing the Accused, therefore, I am mindful that the sentences imposed by this Court have to deter the Accused from committing further offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing</span> [2019] 5 SLR 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Ji Qing</span>”), the High Court emphasised that an escalation of sentences may be warranted where the offender’s antecedents disclose a complete disregard for the law (at [62]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In considering the offender’s antecedents and the index offence, the court is inquiring into whether a cycle of offending exists, and if so, what has been the trend of offending behaviour. An escalation of sentences may be warranted where the offender’s antecedents disclose a “cavalier disregard for the law”: [<span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Beng</span> <span class="font-italic">v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10] at [16]; or as the Malaysian High Court put the point in <span class="font-italic">Soosainathan v PP</span> [2001] 2 MLJ 377 at 385D, where the offender’s prior criminality “demonstrate[s] that the current offence is no passing lapse, but evidence of a real unwillingness … to comply with the law”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Further, a review of the Accused’s antecedents and the Statements of Facts for his convictions in 2007 and his conviction in 2014 show that, by 2007, the Accused had begun to commit house-breaking by night for the purpose of stealing female undergarments. In the present set of offences, the sexual nature of the Accused’s offences escalated significantly when he raped the Victim. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Low Ji Qing</span>, proportionality of the crime to the punishment may therefore demand a significantly heavier sentence to take into account this marked escalation in the Accused’s reoffending (at [75]–[76]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75  … [W]here the index offence is much more egregious, then proportionality may in fact demand a significantly heavier sentence to take account of the marked escalation in the accused person’s offending. What is essential is for the sentencing court to undertake a comparison of the <span class="font-italic">gravity</span> of the antecedent and the index offences, and consider how this should affect the sentence to be imposed for the index offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76 In order to have the correct factual basis for applying the principle of escalation, a sentencing court should also be alert to the fact that reference solely to an accused person’s antecedents in the form of the Criminal Records Office (“CRO”) record may be insufficient. The CRO record typically indicates the offences the accused person had been charged with, and the sentences imposed in respect of those charges. In order to have a fuller comparison between the index offence and the antecedent offence, it might sometimes be helpful or necessary to have reference to, among other things, the charges, statement of facts, psychiatric reports, and grounds of decision (where available). It is not every case where this will be called for – but certainly where the principle of escalation is in play, a court should endeavour to have as complete a picture as possible.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is necessary to deter the Accused and would-be offenders from committing these serious offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I shall now consider the approach to dealing with an offender who is facing multiple charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Court’s approach to dealing with an offender who has multiple charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is well established that a sentencing court dealing with an offender who has multiple charges must first determine the appropriate individual sentence for each charge which the accused has been convicted of (see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee </span>at [26]).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Based on the evidence, the Accused was clearly an opportunist. The intention of the Accused to rape the Victim was not formed at the KTV Lounge. Rather, his intention to commit rape arose after he drove the Victim home and assisted the Victim’s friends, namely Henry Tan Jun Yuan (“Henry”) and Ma Jinzhe (“Ma”), to put the Victim on her bed. It was about this time that he knew that the Victim was unconscious from heavy intoxication and that the key to the Unit was easily accessible as he saw Henry slipping the key underneath the main door of the Unit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 When the Accused saw an opportunity to rape the Victim, he started to carefully execute his plan to rape her. He sent the Victim’s friends home and thereafter he returned to the Apartment. However, the Accused made 12 calls to the Victim along the way. As I had found in the <span class="font-italic">Conviction Judgment</span> (at [125]), the purpose of the 12 calls to the Victim was to confirm that the Victim remained intoxicated and unconscious before he entered the Unit. This would have enabled him to take full advantage of the Victim’s state of unconsciousness to outrage her modesty with a view to rape her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In light of the above, when the Accused knew that he could retrieve the key to enter the Unit, he started to plan to rape the Victim. Thus, the Accused had shown a considered commitment to commit serious offences and these reflect greater criminality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The vulnerability of the Victim</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I next consider the vulnerability of the Victim. It is clear that the rape of a victim who is vulnerable would be an offence-specific aggravating factor, as set out in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>(at [44(e)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Rape of a vulnerable victim</span>: The rape of a victim who is especially vulnerable because of age, physical frailty, mental impairment or disorder, learning disability. Concerns of general deterrence weigh heavily in favour of the imposition of a more severe sentence to deter would-be offenders from preying on such victims (see [<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Law Aik Meng </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814] at [24(b)]). Such cases would often, but not invariably, be accompanied by evidence of an abuse of position/trust and/or some element of premeditation and planning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Court of Appeal also made clear in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>that an intoxicated victim can be considered vulnerable, if such intoxication resulted in the victim losing control over his or her ability to respond to sexual advances (at [125]–[127]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">125 In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, this court explained that a victim could be vulnerable because of “age, physical frailty, mental impairment or disorder, learning disability” (at [44(e)]). The appellant’s interpretation of this aggravating factor is that it encompasses all manner of vulnerability caused by “characteristics of a <span class="font-italic">permanent and enduring nature</span>, and not … temporary intoxication” [emphasis added]. Against this, the PP argues that victims who are “severely intoxicated” are also vulnerable because their physical and mental state renders them unable to resist sexual assault. The PP does concede, however, that mildly intoxicated victims may not be physically or mentally impaired and thus not vulnerable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">126 We agree with the PP for two reasons. First, approaching the matter in the abstract, we see no basis for distinguishing between a victim who is vulnerable because of a permanent characteristic and one who is vulnerable because of a temporary condition – for example, one who is physically frail because of a sprained ankle or mentally impaired because of heavy intoxication. The latter might also become targets because they are less able to fend off the offender’s sexual advances in the moment of the offence. A permanent condition may make a victim more vulnerable because it may afford the offender an opportunity for a more sustained course of sexual assault. This is the case with young victims: consider <span class="font-italic">PP v BNN</span> [2014] SGHC 7, where the offender was the stepfather of the victim and abused her over three years, his abuses growing in intensity and perversion (see [<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 449] at [54(d)]). A victim with only a temporary disability or impairment may be less likely to be subjected to such a course of sexual assault, but it does not mean she is not vulnerable on the single occasion on which she is assaulted. The essential feature of this aggravating factor is that its existence makes it easier for the offender to commit the rape of the victim. The offender who targets an intoxicated victim exploits the same advantage. The intoxicated victim might be physically weak or suffer lapses in consciousness, and thus would be, in the Judge’s words, in “less of a condition to resist any sexual assault” (Sentence GD at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">127 Second, as a matter of case authority, it is well recognised that an intoxicated victim is in a position of vulnerability in relation to a sexual offender, and that this factor in turn aggravates the offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the present case, the Victim was severely intoxicated at the material time of the rape and the Accused took full advantage of the Victim’s complete helplessness to rape her. The Defence similarly accepts that the Victim was vulnerable by virtue of her intoxication.

</div> Therefore, the vulnerability of the Victim, which the Accused knew of and exploited, was an operative offence-specific aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Lasting harm caused to the Victim</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I now consider the harm caused to the Victim as a result of the rape. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> (at [44(h)]), the court considered that the harm caused to the Victim would constitute an aggravating factor in sexual offences:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Severe harm to victim</span>: As Rajah J stressed in [<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v NF</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 849], every act of rape invariably inflicts immeasurable harm on a victim (at [46] and [47]). It seriously violates the dignity of the victim by depriving the victim’s right to sexual autonomy and it leaves irretrievable physical, emotional and psychological scars. Where the rape results in especially serious physical or mental effects on the victim such as pregnancy, the transmission of a serious disease, or a psychiatric illness, this is a serious aggravating factor. In many cases, the harm suffered by the victim will be set out in a victim impact statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the present case, there was serious harm caused to the Victim. The Accused committed the grave offence of rape in the Victim’s bedroom. The Victim’s bedroom was meant to be a safe haven for her to rest peacefully. Instead, the Accused breached that safe haven and proceeded to rape the Victim. In doing so, the Accused turned the Victim’s bedroom into a constant reminder of the rape. The Accused’s act was an outrageous and gross invasion of the Victim’s privacy.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Further, the medical report by Dr Guo Song, a Psychiatrist and Senior Consultant at the Department of Addiction Medicine at IMH, which was adduced by the Prosecution, makes clear that the Victim suffered a lasting impact following the offence of rape by the Accused (at para 24):

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng </span>(at [21(b)]), it was recognised that the offender’s failure to use any protection would serve as an aggravating factor. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> further explained, <span class="font-italic">albeit </span>in the context of distinguishing between penile penetration of the vagina and digital penetration of the vagina, why exposing a victim to unwanted pregnancy or risk of contracting a sexually-transmitted disease added to the trauma suffered by the victim (at [150(a)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It cannot be denied that an unwanted pregnancy and contracting a sexually-transmitted disease would have far-reaching consequences for the victim. The knowledge that she would be at risk of becoming pregnant or contracting a sexually-transmitted disease would itself inflict an extra level of trauma on the victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Therefore, the significant and lasting harm caused to the Victim as a result of the Accused’s rape offence must be recognised by this Court when considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the Accused for the Rape Charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The Accused’s attempt to conceal the offence of rape</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Here, the Accused offered the Victim monetary compensation as he thought that this might lead to the Victim not reporting the Accused to the police for rape. In other words, the Accused was seeking to conceal his offence of rape from the police by offering to compensate the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Vasentha Joseph</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated, in the context of drug offences, that an offender’s attempt to conceal his offence should be treated as an aggravating factor and explained the rationale for this (at [69]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, an offender’s attempt to conceal or dispose of the evidence of his offence, such as drugs or paraphernalia, in order to avoid prosecution or a heavier sentence should be treated as an aggravating factor. The rationale for this is not dissimilar to the basis on which attempts to conceal the offence or prevent detection are treated as enhancing culpability. In these cases, the accused is generally seeking to do one or more of a number of things: to avoid detection in order to continue the unlawful conduct; to avoid the full and proper consequences of his illicit actions; or to thwart law enforcement efforts. The aggravating weight to be placed on this may depend on the circumstances. Where the offender has successfully disposed of the drugs in his possession, the sentencing judge must not speculate on the original quantity of drugs and attempt to sentence the offender as if the drugs had not been disposed of; but the judge would undoubtedly be entitled to enhance the sentence having regard to this aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the present case, the Accused offered to compensate the Victim. The Accused sought to conceal the offence of rape to avoid the full and proper consequences of his illicit actions. When the Accused offered compensation to the Victim, he did not know that the Victim had already called the police. The Accused admitted that if he had known that the Victim had already reported the rape to the police, he would not have offered any compensation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Further, the Accused’s conduct of offering the Victim compensation was, in fact, a charade. The Accused did not have a real intention to compensate the Victim. Rather, he offered a large sum simply to persuade her to drop the case against him. Once the Victim dropped her case, the Accused had no intention to fully compensate the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Therefore, the Accused’s conduct is an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Whether there was any abuse of third-party trust</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Prosecution submits that there was an element of abuse of third-party trust in this case, given that the Victim’s friends allowed the Accused to drive them all home and to help put the Victim on her bed.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Prosecution cites the case of <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span> in support of its position. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span>, the offender, the victim and several acquaintances were at a nightclub. The victim lost consciousness as a result of intoxication. The offender told the victim’s friends and the staff of the nightclub that he would send the victim to her home. The offender was, therefore, entrusted by the others with control of the victim’s person and movement to bring her home and keep her unharmed. Instead, the offender proceeded to drive the victim to his residence where he had sexual intercourse with her. The offender was convicted of a charge of abduction as well as a charge of rape. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It was in the context of the offender being entrusted by the victim’s friends and the staff of the night to send the victim to her home that the court in <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span> stated the following (at [142]–[143]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">142 While exploitation of entrustment by third parties was not expressly recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> as an example of an offence-specific aggravating factor, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to treat this factor as such. Where the safety or wellbeing of the victim is entrusted to an offender by third parties, the offender, although not in a position of trust or responsibility in the sense outlined in the previous section, nevertheless commits an analogous “dual wrong”: not only has he committed a serious crime, he has violated the trust placed in him by others to protect or at least refrain from causing harm to the victim. That would, to my mind, be sufficient to amount to an offence-specific aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">143 On the present facts, the [a]ccused was given the opportunity to be alone with the [v]ictim and to be in control of the [v]ictim’s person and movement because the others had entrusted him with bringing her home and keeping her unharmed. In fact, the [a]ccused had told the [v]ictim’s friends, including Kwok, and the staff of Zouk that he would send the [v]ictim home. However, the [a]ccused violated such trust placed in him by the others; he exploited the situation and committed a heinous act on the [v]ictim. In the circumstances, I found that the exploitation of the entrustment that the third parties had reposed in the [a]ccused was an offence-specific aggravating factor in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The facts in <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span> are quite different from the facts of the present case. The offender in <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span> was specifically entrusted by the victim’s friends and the staff of the nightclub to send the victim to her home. The offender had, however, breached that trust by abducting the victim and bringing her to his own home. Although the facts in the present case are not the same as in <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the Accused had also breached the trust of the Victim’s friends, Henry and Ma. They allowed the Accused to go into the Unit as they trusted him. They also allowed the Accused to witness the slipping of the Victim’s door key beneath the main door of the Unit. Henry and Ma would not have allowed the Accused into the Unit if they had known of the insidious motive of the Accused to rape the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) The sentencing band which the Accused’s rape offence falls within</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Having considered the offence-specific aggravating factors, I am unable to accept the Defence’s submission that this offence has only one offence-specific aggravating factor, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Victim was vulnerable given that she was intoxicated.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In the <span class="font-italic">Conviction Judgment</span>, I had found that the Accused continuously changed his evidence on significant events throughout the trial. In particular, I made the findings that the Accused had lied numerous times in the face of objective forensic and scientific evidence before the Court (see the <span class="font-italic">Conviction Judgment</span> at [275]). For example, the Accused was confronted with forensic evidence in the form of the DNA analysis of the high vaginal swab which showed that the Accused’s DNA was found in the high region of the Victim’s vagina. This indicated that the Accused’s penis had penetrated deep into the Victim’s vagina. Against this independent forensic evidence, however, the Accused defiantly claimed that his penis only entered “[j]ust a bit” into the Victim’s vagina. To counter the forensic evidence, the Accused suddenly alleged in the course of trial that he had used his finger to penetrate deep into the Victim’s vagina. This was raised for the first time on the second last day of the trial, and appeared to be an embellishment on the Accused’s part. In my view, this clearly illustrated the Accused’s defiant manner of conducting his defence despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In <span class="font-italic">Ganesan Sivasankar</span>, the High Court set out quite clearly that it would be relevant during sentencing if an offender conducted his defence in a defiant manner despite being faced with overwhelming evidence which clearly contradicts his defence (at [35]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is well established that the mere fact of claiming trial is not an aggravating circumstance (<span class="font-italic">Kuek Ah Lek v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 766 at [65]). At the same time, however, the fact that an accused maintains the correctness of his position “in a defiant manner right to the end, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary”, is a relevant factor to be taken into account (<span class="font-italic">Lee Foo Choong Kelvin v PP</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 292 at [36]), as is the fact that an accused has “all but spun an entire fairy tale in court” (<span class="font-italic">Trade Facilities Pte Ltd v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 7 at [116]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thus, the Accused’s defiant manner of conducting his defence must be treated as an aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I was particularly troubled by the Accused’s scandalous allegations made against the Victim throughout the course of the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Accused advanced an unbelievable allegation that the Victim was intimate towards him at the KTV lounge when they first met. This was completely contrary to the evidence by the Prosecution’s witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The Accused made the above allegation to support his defence that the Victim had fabricated the claim of rape against him. The Accused alleged that the Victim made the false claim so that she could remain in Singapore for a longer period as she had to assist in the police investigations. This was, however, a completely absurd and scandalous allegation. Nevertheless, the Accused falsely alleged that the Victim had seduced him at the KTV Lounge, lured and invited him into the Unit, physically caressed him in the Unit, willingly had sex with him, disengaged in the midst of penetration, and then cried rape and called the police (see the <span class="font-italic">Conviction Judgment</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [286]). Such scandalous aspersions against the Victim were entirely fabricated. These aspersions illustrated clearly that the Accused did not have an iota of remorse during the trial.

Therefore, while he claims to be remorseful now, this expression of remorse only appears after he has been found guilty by this Court and is about to face punishment for his crimes.

</div>
</div> Before the present offence, the Accused was convicted of five house-breaking by night offences, with three other house-breaking by night charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Further, as I have set out in the table at [49] above, the Accused previously received sentences of between 24 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane and four years’ imprisonment for his past house-breaking by night offences. In his last set of house-breaking by night offences in 2007, the highest individual sentence meted out on the Accused was three years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Despite being convicted multiple times for house-breaking by night offences, the Accused has not shown any commitment to refrain from reoffending. Therefore, it is necessary to deter the Accused and other would-be offenders from committing offences of house-breaking by night. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Further, the Accused’s present offence of house-breaking by night was much more serious as he committed it for the purpose of committing a grave sexual offence of rape. If there was no house-breaking offence, there would not have been a rape. The Accused knew the severity of the punishment for house-breaking by night when he unlawfully entered the Unit as he had been previously punished for it. This did not deter him in any way. This serious escalation in the nature of the Accused’s house-breaking by night offence cannot be ignored. However, I am mindful that the Accused has been convicted and is being sentenced separately for the Rape Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In view of the foregoing, there must be a significant uplift in the sentence for the Accused’s present offence forming the House-breaking Charge. Bearing in mind the sentences that have been imposed for the Accused’s previous house-breaking by night offences, the appropriate sentence for the House-breaking Charge is four years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The aggregate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Having determined the appropriate sentences in respect of each of the Charges, I shall determine a suitable aggregate sentence.

Whether multiple offences form part of a single transaction depends on whether they form a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” (<span class="font-italic">Raveen </span>at [39], citing D A Thomas, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Sentencing: The Sentencing Policy of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division</span> (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) at p 53). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the present case, the Prosecution submits that the sentences for the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge ought to run consecutively.

</div>
</div> I would like to pause here and mention that there is an error in the Defence’s total sentence. The Defence urges the Court to order the imprisonment terms to run concurrently, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the total sentence of imprisonment would be 12 years’ imprisonment. However, caning cannot be ordered to run concurrently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chan Chuan and another </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Chuan</span>”), Punch Coomaraswamy J stated (at [39]) that sentences of caning cannot be imposed as concurrent sentences. Coomaraswamy J further observed that the provisions in the then Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC 1985”) did not provide for such a possibility. He also placed emphasis on s 230 of the CPC 1985 which provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences any two or more of which are legally punishable by caning the combined sentence of caning awarded by the court for any such offences shall not, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding, exceed a total number of 24 strokes in the case of adults or 10 strokes in the case of youthful offenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In Coomaraswamy J’s view (at [40]), “the sentences of caning are to be aggregated provided that, in the case of an adult, the maximum of 24 strokes is not exceeded”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The substance of s 230 of the CPC 1985 is now embodied in s 328 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">328</span>.—(1) Despite any provision of this Code or any other law to the contrary, where an accused is sentenced at the same sitting for 2 or more offences punishable by caning (called in this section the relevant offences), the aggregate sentence of caning imposed by the court in respect of the relevant offences must not exceed the specified limit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  (6)  In this section, the specified limit is 24 strokes in the case of an adult and 10 strokes in the case of a juvenile.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The position in <span class="font-italic">Chan Chuan </span>was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yuen Ye Ming v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 2 SLR 970 (“<span class="font-italic">Yuen Ye Ming</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Yuen Ye Ming</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [26]), the Court of Appeal saw no need to revisit the position in <span class="font-italic">Chan Chuan</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Against this backdrop of consistent and established jurisprudence, we see no reason to revisit the High Court decision in [<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chan Chuan</span> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 14]. To reiterate the reasoning of the High Court in that case, if Parliament had intended to make available the power to impose concurrent sentences of caning, this power would have been provided for as in the case of imprisonment terms. This view has been reflected clearly and consistently in the courts’ sentencing practice and Parliament has not sought to change or to correct it by statutory amendment over these past decades although many major changes to the CPC have been made. Therefore, to invoke s 6 of the CPC for the purpose of introducing a non-statutory power relating to caning which Parliament has seen fit all these years not to incorporate into the CPC would be to contradict Parliament’s intention. The principle of proportionality must take reference from the legislative intent of Parliament. Where Parliament has expressed its intention clearly in the form of mandatory caning or a mandatory number of strokes while setting only the specified limit of 24 strokes for adult offenders in s 328 of the CPC, it is impermissible for the court to qualify or even to nullify such intention by the subtle use of non-statutory powers in a supposed quest for proportionality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Therefore, though the Defence asks for the sentences of imprisonment for the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge to run concurrently, this would only affect the total imprisonment term and not the number of strokes of the cane to be imposed on the Accused. Given the Defence’s submissions on the appropriate sentences, the total sentence that the Defence is, in fact, seeking is 12 years’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I now return to the issue of the one-transaction principle. It is undeniable that the two different offences were temporally proximate. However, the focus must remain on the different legally-protected interests which were violated. The offence of rape and the offence of house-breaking by night infringed upon separate and distinct interests of the Victim. This was similarly the observation of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng </span>(at [55] and [62]) when it dealt with an offender convicted of a charge of robbery with hurt as well as a charge of rape. The fact that the offences were proximate in time or involved the same victim carried little weight, in view of the fact that the offences led to different interests of the victim being infringed upon. The same principle must apply here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 2 SLR 647 (“<span class="font-italic">Sutarno</span>”), the Court of Appeal found that the offences of rape and house-breaking violated different legally-protected interests and should not be regarded as being part of a single transaction (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having determined the individual sentence for each charge, the next stage is for the court to consider whether they should run consecutively or concurrently. In our judgment, the Judge was correct in ordering all three sentences to run consecutively. First, s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) provides that where a person is sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least two offences to run consecutively. Second, the possession charge relates to a separate transaction which took place about a month prior to the rape and house-breaking offences. Third, although the latter two offences were temporally proximate, the offences of rape and house-breaking violate different legally-protected interests and should not be regarded as being part of a single transaction: [<span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 68] at [62]; <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span>[<span class="font-italic">S</span>]<span class="font-italic">houffee</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Adam v PP</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [33]. Distinct offences should be punished separately with consecutive sentences so as to ensure that each legally-protected interest is properly vindicated. Otherwise, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would result in the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending: [<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Raveen Balakrishnan </span>[2018] 5 SLR 799] at [41]–[46].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In view of the fact that the Accused’s two offences in the present case infringed separate and distinct interests of the Victim, the Court is unable to accept the Defence’s submission seeking for the sentences of imprisonment for the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge to run concurrently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 More significantly, however, the consequences of allowing the sentences for the Rape Charge and House-breaking Charge to run concurrently would be to marginalise the Accused’s house-breaking by night offence. This would mean that despite the Accused’s numerous house-breaking by night antecedents, he is only punished for the Rape Charge and he is not punished for the House-breaking Charge in terms of imprisonment. As was noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sutarno</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [22]), the imposition of concurrent sentences would result in “the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Therefore, the apposite punishment for the Accused is to order the sentences of imprisonment for the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge to run consecutively. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The totality principle requires that the Court first examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the sentences normally meted out for the most serious of the individual sentences committed (see <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [54]). The Court would then proceed to consider whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects (see <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 To order the sentences for the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge to run consecutively would lead to a total sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane. In my view, this sentence cannot be said to be crushing or not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I highlight that the sentence imposed for the Rape Charge is already on the lower end of Band 2 of the<span class="font-italic"> Terence Ng </span>sentencing framework. I would have imposed a sentence falling within the middle to higher end of Band 2 in view of the numerous aggravating factors. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span>, the offender was untraced and claimed trial. There were only two offence-specific aggravating factors and no offender-specific aggravating factors. Despite this, the court in <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span> imposed a sentence of 13 and a half years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In contrast to <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span>, I have imposed a sentence which is on the lower end of Band 2, despite the fact that the present case featured additional offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating factors. Therefore, the total sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane cannot be said to be substantially above the sentences normally meted out for the most serious of the individual sentences committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Further, the Accused has multiple house-breaking by night antecedents. As I have elucidated above at [49]–[59], the Accused is a recalcitrant person and demonstrated a consistent pattern of reoffending. In ordering the sentences to run consecutively, the total sentence cannot be said to be one which is not in keeping with his past record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Finally, in view of the Accused’s age and the severity of the Charges the total sentence is not crushing on the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings on the sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In summary, my findings on the sentences are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane is appropriate for the Rape Charge. There are numerous offence-specific aggravating factors which make this offence falls within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>sentencing framework. The Accused was an opportunist who had engaged in careful planning as soon as he spotted an opportunity to rape the Victim. The Accused also took advantage of the Victim who was vulnerable by virtue of her heavy intoxication. The rape had also caused lasting psychological harm to the Victim. The Accused also attempted to conceal his offence of rape from the police by offering to compensate the Victim. There are also a number of offender-specific aggravating factors. The Accused conducted his defence in an unnecessary manner and made scandalous allegations against the Victim. While he has expressed remorse in his mitigation plea, this remorse must be given little weight in view of his evident lack of remorse at the trial. The Accused had agreed for a third charge, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the TIC Charge, to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In view of the offence-specific and offender-specific factors, a sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane is appropriate for the Rape Charge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The sentence of four years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane is appropriate for the House-breaking Charge. This is the Accused’s ninth house-breaking by night offence. The Accused had received sentences of between 24 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane and four years’ imprisonment for his past house-breaking by night offences. Despite being convicted multiple times for house-breaking by night charges, the Accused has not shown any commitment to refrain from reoffending. There is a need to deter the Accused and would-be offenders from committing offences of house-breaking by night. The House-breaking Charge is egregious as it was committed to rape the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The present case warrants the punishment for the Rape Charge and House-breaking Charge to run consecutively, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a total sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane. While the two offences were temporally proximate, the offence of rape and the offence of house-breaking by night infringed separate and distinct interests of the Victim. Conversely, to order the sentences to run concurrently, in light of the Accused’s antecedents, would result in marginalising the severity of the Accused’s crimes. This would be a perverse and unjust outcome.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The total sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane cannot be said to be crushing or not in keeping with his past record and future prospects. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For all of the above reasons, I sentence the Accused to 17 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chong Kee En and Susanna Yim (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">S S Dhillon and Suppiah Krishnamurthi (Dhillon &amp; Panoo LLC) for the Defence.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
