        Chan Wei Sern Paul AR:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       By Summons 5001 of 2011 (“SUM
                    5001”), the defendant seeks to strike out the plaintiff’s Statement
                    of Claim (Amendment No. 1) and prays for the plaintiff’s claim in
                    this action to be wholly dismissed. At the heart of this matter lies the import
                    of section 12A of the Medicines Act (Cap 176, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“Medicines Act”), a provision enacted in 2004 to enable Singapore
                    to fulfil part of its obligations arising from the United States-Singapore Free
                    Trade Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Both the plaintiff and the defendant are
                    companies which engage in the research, development, manufacture and
                    commercialisation of healthcare products, including medicines. The former is
                    incorporated in Sweden, the latter Singapore. The plaintiff is also the owner of
                    Singapore Patent No. 89993 (“the Patent”). The full title of
                    the invention for which the Patent was granted is “Pharmaceutical
                    Compositions Comprising a HMG COA Reductase Inhibitor”. Claim 5 of the
                    specification of the Patent states the essence of the invention in the following
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    [The plaintiff] present as a feature of the
                            invention</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    A pharmaceutical composition comprising the Agent
                            [chemically defined earlier in the specification but which we may for
                            present purposes simply term as Rosuvastatin Calcium] as an active
                            ingredient and an inorganic salt in which the cation is
                            multivalent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The use of an inorganic salt in which the cation
                            is multivalent as a stabilising agent in a pharmaceutical composition
                            comprising the Agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the invention is composed of two elements, an
                    active ingredient (Rosuvastatin Calcium) and a stabiliser. Significantly for
                    this application, the stabiliser consists specifically of “an inorganic
                    salt in which the cation is multivalent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 1 April 2011, the defendant submitted
                    its applications to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for
                    product licences in respect of the following products:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Rosucard Film-coated Tablet 10
                        mg;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Rosucard
                        Film-coated Tablet 20 mg; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     Rosucard Film-coated Tablet 40 mg.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For
                    ease of reference, these shall henceforth be called the “Proposed
                    Products”. According to section 5 of the Medicines Act, a product licence
                    is required to: (a) sell, supply or export any medicinal product; (b) procure
                    the sale, supply or exportation of any medicinal product; or (c) procure the
                    manufacture or assembly of any medicinal product for sale, supply or
                    exportation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In its application forms, the defendant openly
                    declared that these were applications where:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     a patent was in force in respect of
                        the Proposed Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     the defendant was not the proprietor of the
                    patent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        proprietor had not consented to nor acquiesced in the grant of the product
                        licences; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     in
                        the opinion and to the best belief of the defendant, the patent would not be
                        infringed by the doing of the act for which the licences were
                    sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant further elaborated that the proprietor
                    of the patent was the plaintiff and that the relevant patent was indeed
                    Singapore Patent No. 89993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By way of a letter, the HSA subsequently
                    requested the defendant to serve a notice to the plaintiff using a form set out
                    in the Sixth Schedule to the Medicines (Licensing, Standard Provisions and Fees)
                    Regulations (Cap 176, S 74, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Regulations”). This the defendant did in a notice dated 19 April
                    2011 (“the Notice”). In the Notice, the defendant informed the
                    defendant that applications for product licences have been made to the HSA in
                    respect of the Proposed Products and further stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    In [the defendant’s] opinion and to the best
                            of [its] belief, the [Patent] will not be infringed by the doing of the
                            act for which the licence is sought. The basis of [its] opinion is: [the
                            defendant’s] proposed composition does not comprise an
                            “inorganic salt in which the cation is multivalent” as set
                            out in the patent claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Unless an application is made, within 45 days from
                            the date of this Notice is served on you, for a court order restraining
                            the act for which the licence is applied for or a declaration by a court
                            of the Registrar of Patents that the [Patent] will be infringed by the
                            doing of that act, the HSA may proceed to grant the
                        licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Pursuant to Section 12A(5) of the Medicines Act read with
                    regulation 5B(3) of the Regulations, the effect of the plaintiff making the
                    application as stated in paragraph 3 of the Notice within the 45-day period
                    would be that a 30-month stay on the processing of the product licence
                    applications would be enforced by the HSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 10 June 2011, the plaintiff filed its
                    original Statement of Claim, the practical effect of which was to set in place
                    the 30-month moratorium. There was some dispute over whether the action was
                    commenced within the 45-day period but it appeared that the HSA has accepted
                    that it was and this point was not material in the present application. The
                    Statement of Claim was subsequently amended. In its final form, the plaintiff
                    prays, <em>inter alia</em>, for:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    a declaration that
                            the defendant’s performance of the following acts in Singapore
                            will infringe the Patent:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">i.    disposal of the defendant’s
                                Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">ii.    offer to dispose of the defendant’s
                                Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iii.   using the defendant’s
                            Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iv.    importing the defendant’s
                                Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">v.    keeping whether for disposal or otherwise of
                                the defendant’s Products.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    an injunction to restrain the defendant whether
                            acting by its directors, officers, employees, servants or agents, or any
                            of them or otherwise howsoever from infringing Singapore Patent
                            No. SG89993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The only basis for these prayers appears to be the allegation that
                    the stated acts “will infringe claims 1 to 27 of the Singapore Patent
                    No. SG89993 if carried out by the Defendant in Singapore”. No
                    Particulars of Infringement was filed for the plaintiff did not think it
                    necessary for an action of this kind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant thereafter sought further
                    particulars of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. This request was
                    considered to be wholly misconceived by the plaintiff and was for that reason
                    rejected. On 4 November 2011, the defendant then filed SUM 5001 pursuant to
                    O. 18, r. 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”) to, as stated earlier, strike out the action. The
                    defendant’s application is supported by a lengthy affidavit but the
                    plaintiff chose not to file an affidavit in response.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Initially, the defendant proceeded on the
                    assumption that the plaintiff is taking out a patent infringement action
                    pursuant to sections 66 and 67 of the Patents Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Patents Act”). In order to rely upon these sections for
                    an action of patent infringement, the defendant argued that the patentee is
                    required to provide at least one instance of a past infringement. Without a
                    history of infringement, any action pursuant to section 67 is doomed to failure.
                    In the present action, it is common ground between the parties that <em>the defendant has not yet committed any act which could be said to
                        amount to an infringement of the Patent.</em> The only act which the
                    defendant could be said to have performed in respect of the Proposed Products in
                    Singapore was to apply for product licences. This in itself was not an
                    infringing act on the authority of <em>The Upjohn Company v T.
                        Kerfoot &amp; Co. Ltd.</em>[1988] FSR 1 (“<em>Upjohn v Kerfoot</em>”). For this reason alone, it was
                    submitted that the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was also suggested that the purpose of the
                    plaintiff’s action is merely to institute the 30-month stay on the
                    processing of the product licence applications for the Proposed Products.
                    Alternatively, the defendant also opined that the plaintiff is attempting to
                    obtain confidential information regarding the Proposed Products for the
                    plaintiff’s own purposes. The plaintiff’s action is, in short, not a
                        <em>bona fide</em> action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     During the hearing, the court was informed by
                    the plaintiff that it is not taking out a patent infringement action pursuant to
                    the Patents Act. Rather, the plaintiff is relying upon the section 12A of the
                    Medicines Act for its cause of action. To this argument, the defendant submitted
                    that section 12A of the Medicines Act did not provide for a cause of action
                    separate and independent from a patent infringement action under the Patents
                    Act. The defendant opined that the provision in the Medicines Act merely
                    provides for a notification mechanism whereby a patentee would be informed of
                    any application for a product licence which related to its patent. However, any
                    action to be taken out should still be made pursuant to the Patents Act. The
                    defendant pointed out that unlike section 67 of the Patents Act, the Medicines
                    Act did not specifically give a patentee the right to commence civil
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In any case, the defendant also argued that
                    even if section 12A of the Medicines Act contemplated an action separate and
                    independent from a patent infringement action under the Patents Act, a mere
                    disbelief of the defendant’s explanation for non-infringement of the
                    plaintiff’s patent is insufficient to sustain an action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before the court, it was clarified on behalf
                    of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is not taking out a patent infringement
                    action under the Patents Act. In fact, it was conceded that the plaintiff has no
                    evidence that the defendant had committed an act of infringement. Such evidence,
                    it was agreed, is necessary to sustain a patent infringement action. Instead,
                    the plaintiff explained that the plaintiff’s action is based on section
                    12A of the Medicines Act which, in his view, provides a separate and independent
                    cause of action. According to the plaintiff, section 12A of the Medicines Act
                    entitles the plaintiff to test the possibility of <em>future</em> infringement of the Patent on the assumption that the
                    defendant will carry out the acts for which the product licences were sought. It
                    is, therefore, pre-emptive in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although it was not explicitly stated on
                    affidavit, it soon became clear that the only reason why the action was
                    commenced is because the plaintiff did not believe that the defendant’s
                    composition did not contain a stabiliser which comprised “an inorganic
                    salt in which the cation is multivalent”. The plaintiff pointed out that
                    the Proposed Products shares the same active ingredient with the invention for
                    which the Patent was granted, namely Rosuvastatin Calcium. Counsel for the
                    plaintiff submitted that, to the best of the plaintiff’s knowledge, it is
                    impossible to use Rosuvastin Calcium without utilising a stabiliser which
                    comprised an inorganic salt in which the cation was multivalent. Unfortunately,
                    no affidavit was filed to aver to that effect. It was argued that the section
                    12A of the Medicines Act entitles the plaintiff to test the defendant’s
                    claim by having the defendant reveal the exact composition of the Proposed
                    Products in discovery. For this reason, it was argued that the action should not
                    be prematurely terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant’s application is made on
                    the basis that the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     discloses no reasonable cause of
                        action;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     is
                        frivolous or vexatious; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     is otherwise an abuse of the process of the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The law regarding striking out of pleadings is
                    not disputed. I need only be brief. The standard which must be satisfied before
                    pleadings can be struck out was set out in the Court of Appeal case of <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and
                        oths</em>, [1997] SLR(R) 649, which reads, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases
                            that the power of striking out should be invoked. This was the view
                            taken by Lindley MR in <em>Hubbuck &amp; Sons v
                                Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark</em> [1899] 1 QB 86 at
                            p 91. It should not be exercised by a minute and protracted
                            examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to see if
                            the plaintiff really has a case of action. The practice of the courts
                            has been that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy
                            and serious argument, the court should decline to proceed with the
                            argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the
                            pleading, but in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will
                            obviate the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for
                            a trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 844, G P Selvam JC explained
                    the court’s reluctance to summarily strike out a claim (at [31]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…This is anchored on the judicial policy to afford a litigant the
                        right to institute a bona fide claim before the courts and to prosecute it
                        in the usual way. <em>Whenever possible the courts will let
                            the plaintiff proceed with the action unless his case is wholly and
                            clearly unarguable…</em> [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In order to determine if the plaintiff’s
                    action discloses no reasonable cause of action, it is necessary to consider the
                    following two issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether section 12A of the Medicines
                        Act contemplates a cause of action separate and independent from a patent
                        infringement action under the Patents Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the first issue is answered in the
                        affirmative, whether the cause of action contemplated in section 12A of the
                        Medicines allows for a patentee to maintain an action solely on the basis
                        that it does not believe the reason for non-infringement proffered by the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will deal with those issues first before
                    turning to the question of whether the plaintiff’s action is frivolous,
                    vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether section 12A of the Medicines Act contemplates a cause of
                action separate and independent from a patent infringement action under the Patents
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This is a critical issue as the
                    defendant’s submissions revolved around the premise that section 12A of
                    the Medicines Act is merely didactic in nature and does not provide for an
                    independent cause of action. To the defendant, the section 12A of the Medicine
                    Act merely allows for a patentee to be notified when an application for a
                    product licence is filed, the subject matter of which is “in respect
                    of” his patent: see sub-sections 12A(2) and (3) of the Medicines Act.
                    Should a patentee wish, thereafter, to commence an action for patent
                    infringement, he must do so, so the defendant submitted, pursuant to the Patents
                    Act. As a result, it is necessary for the plaintiff to plead at least one
                    instance of past infringement in order for his statement of claim to disclose a
                    reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff, as stated earlier, takes the view
                    that the section 12A of the Medicines Act contemplates a cause of action
                    separate and independent from a patent infringement action under the Patents
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     To discern whose view is correct, it is
                    necessary to appreciate the nature of the relevant provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A patent infringement action under the Patents Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In order for a patentee to succeed in a patent
                    infringement action pursuant to the Patents Act, two essential features must be
                    made out. One of these would be the fact that the alleged infringing product
                    falls squarely within the claim of the patent. To ascertain if this feature has
                    been made out, a two-step process is involved. As Lord Upjohn explained in
                        <em>Rodi &amp; Wienenberger AG v Henry Showell Ltd</em>
                    [1969] RPC 367 (“<em>Rodi</em>”) (at p.
                    391):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the court must ascertain what the essential integers of the claim,
                        this remains a question of construction and no general principles can be
                        laid down…Secondly, the essential integers having being ascertained,
                        the infringing article must be considered. To constitute infringement the
                        article must take each and every one of the essential integers of the claim.
                        Non-essential integers may be omitted or replaced by mechanical equivalent;
                        there will still be infringement. I believe this states the whole substance
                        of the ‘pith and marrow’ theory of infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In short, the alleged infringing product must contain the pith and
                    marrow of the claim of the patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Further, and equally importantly, the patentee
                    must also prove that the infringer has committed – and not merely will
                    commit – an act of infringement as defined in section 66 of the Patents
                    Act. Where the invention is a product (as it is in the present case), section 66
                    sets out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>66.</b>-(1) Subject to the provisions of this
                        Act, a person infringes a patent for an invention if, but only if, while the
                        patent is in force, he does any of the following things in Singapore in
                        relation to the invention without the consent of the proprietor of the
                        patent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) where the invention is a product, he makes, disposes of, offers to
                        dispose of, uses or imports the product or keeps it whether for disposal or
                        otherwise;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There appears to be no provision of an action for <em>prospective</em> infringement – notably the word
                    “infringes”, not the phrase “will infringe”, is
                    used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The fact that the there must have been a past
                    act of infringement before a relief for patent infringement will be granted may
                    also be discerned from section 67 of the Patents Act which provides for the
                    available reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>67.</b>-(1) Subject to this Part, civil
                        proceedings may be brought in the court by the proprietor of a patent in

                        any other jurisdiction of the court) in those proceedings a claim may be
                        made –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    for an injunction restraining the defendant from
                            any <em>apprehended</em> act of
                            infringement;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    for an order for him to deliver up or destroy any
                            patented product in relation to which the patent <em>is
                                infringed</em> or any article in which that product is
                            inextricably comprised or any material and implement the predominant use
                            of which has been in the creation of the infringing
                        product;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    
              <em>for damages in respect of the
                                infringement</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    
              <em>for an account of the profits
                                derived by him from the infringement</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    for a declaration that the patent is valid and
                                <em>has been infringed</em> by
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To my mind, the words in italics suggest that all of the reliefs that
                    avails a patentee for a patent infringement are only available when there has
                    been a past instance of infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This understanding of a patent infringement
                    action under the Patents Act is further fortified by O. 87A, r. 2(2) of the
                    Rules. That provision mandates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he plaintiff in such [a patent infringement] action must serve with his
                        statement of claim particulars of the infringement relied on, showing which
                        of the claims in the specification of the patent are alleged to be infringed
                        and <b>giving at least one instance of each type of
                            infringement alleged</b>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In light of the above, it cannot be gainsaid
                    that a patent infringement action brought pursuant to section 67 of the Patents
                    Act requires the satisfaction of two equally fundamental requirements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     the alleged infringing product must
                        fall squarely within the claim of the patent; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     there must have been a past act of
                        infringement as defined in section 66 of the Patents Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For ease for future reference, I shall refer to the former as the
                    “theoretical infringement” requirement and the latter as the
                    “practical infringement” requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 12A of the Medicines Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In my view, section 12A of the Medicines Act
                    contains at least three key features.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     First of all, a declaratory regime is
                    established. By section 12A(2) of the Medicines Act, an applicant for a product
                    licence must declare whether “a patent under the Patents Act is in force
                    in respect of any medicinal product to which the application relates”. If
                    the applicant so declares that there exists such a patent, he must also declare
                    whether he is the proprietor of the patent and, if not, who the proprietor is.
                    Significantly, if the applicant is not the proprietor, the applicant must go on
                    to make either one of two possible declarations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the proprietor has consented to or
                        has acquiesced in the grant of the licence to the applicant;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     in the
                        applicant’s opinion and to the best of his belief, the patent is
                        invalid or will not be infringed by the doing of the act for which the
                        licence is sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The making of the declaration is a serious
                    matter. This is underscored by the fact that a false declaration is a criminal
                    offence pursuant to section 20 of the Medicines Act and any person guilty of
                    making a false declaration is liable, upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding
                    $5000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to
                both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In addition to a declaratory regime, section
                    12A(3) of the Medicines Act also sets out a notification procedure. If the HSA
                    deems it appropriate, the HSA may require the applicant, as it did in the
                    defendant’s case, to serve a notice on the proprietor of the patent in a
                    prescribed form and furnish evidence of the service to the HSA. The prescribed
                    form is one found in the Sixth Schedule to the Regulations and states, <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless an application is made, within 45 days from the date of this Notice
                        is served on you, for a court order restraining the act for which the
                        licence is applied for or a declaration by a court or the Registrar of
                        Patents that –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the patent is valid; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the patent will be infringed by the doing of [the
                            act for which the licence is sought],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the HSA may proceed to grant the licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By way of the declaratory and notification regimes, the registered
                    patents are “linked” to relevant products for which applications
                    for product licences have been sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is notable that the notification regime
                    hints at a legal action – it refers to “an application for a court
                    order... that the patent is valid or the patent will be infringed by the doing
                    of [the act for which the licence is sought]”. This is the action that
                    the plaintiff seeks to take out. The question to answer is whether the
                    legislative regime refers to an existing cause of action or sets out a new,
                    independent cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Finally, section 12A of the Medicines Act
                    delineates two circumstances, amongst others stated in the Medicines Act, under
                    which the HSA may grant a product licence: see subsections 12A(5) and (6) of the
                    Medicines Act. These are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     The proprietor of the patent has
                        not, within 45 days from the date of the notice served on him by the
                        applicant, instituted an application for a restraining order or a
                        declaration as stated in the notice <em>and</em>
                        informed the HSA, by way of written notice, that such an application has
                        been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        proprietor of the patent has made the application referred to in the notice
                        but no such order or declaration has been obtained within 30 months of the
                        making of the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the outcome of the legal
                    action contemplated in section 12A(3) of the Medicines Act, read with section 5B
                    and the Sixth Schedule of the Regulations, materially affects the ability of the
                    applicant to obtain a product licence after the 30-month
                moratorium.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Compatibility of section 12A of the Medicines Act and a patent
                infringement action under the Patents Act </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     From the foregoing analysis of the relevant
                    provisions in the Patents Medicines Acts, it is my view that section 12A of the
                    Medicines Act does not envisage the taking out of a patent infringement action
                    under the Patents Act. The incompatibility of the two is clear. Section 12A of
                    the Medicines Act, read with section 5B and the Sixth Schedule of the
                    Regulations, contemplates the taking out of an action for <em>prospective</em> infringement - “the patent will be
                    infringed”. However, a patent infringement action under the Patents Act
                    is the converse. As explained earlier, it is a fundamental feature of a patent
                    infringement action under the Patents Act that there be a <em>past</em> act of infringement. A future possibility of practical
                    infringement alone is insufficient to sustain a patent infringement action.
                    Without the satisfaction of the <em>practical</em>
                    infringement requirement of a patent infringement action, not only is any relief
                    unavailable, the entire action is wholly unsustainable under section 67 of the
                    Patents Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     What the two actions do have in common is the
                    fact that both appear to require the satisfaction of the <em>theoretical</em> infringement requirement. In other words, both
                    require the determination of whether the relevant product (the alleged
                    infringing product in the case of a patent infringement action under the Patents
                    Act and the product for which the product licence is sought in the case of
                    section 12A of the Medicines Act) falls squarely within the claim of the patent.
                    In a patent infringement action, this is well-established: see for instance
                        <em>First Currency Choice Pte Ltd v Main-Line Corporate
                        Holdings Ltd and another appeal</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 335 and
                        <em>Contour Optik Inc v Pearl’s Optical Co Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2002] SGHC 238. Where section 12A of the Medicines
                    Act is concerned, this may be inferred. The provision operates on the assumption
                    that the practical infringing act will be committed. Thus, in order to determine
                    whether “the patent will be infringed”, all that is left to do is
                    to assess the theoretical aspect of the infringement. In fact, from my reading
                    of section 12A of the Medicines Act, this appears to be the whole substance of
                    an action under that provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant suggested that there is no
                    direct reference to the creation of an independent cause of action of action in
                    section 12A of the Medicines Act. This is unlike the Patents Act where section
                    67 clearly reads that “...civil proceedings may be brought in court by
                    the proprietor of a patent in respect of any act alleged to infringe the
                    patent...” I believe this sentiment to be overstated. In the first place,
                    section 12A of the Medicines Act does not, by any stretch of the imagination,
                    refer to a patent infringement action under the Patents Act either. Hence, the
                    defendant’s main argument that the plaintiff should take out a patent
                    infringement action is equally untenable on this count. More importantly, I take
                    the view that the relevant legislative provisions (section 12A of the Medicines
                    Act, section 5B of the Regulations and the Sixth Schedule of the Regulations)
                    reflect Parliament’s intention to allow a patentee to take out an action
                    pursuant to those provisions fairly clearly. Section 12A(3) of the Medicines Act
                    allows the HSA to require an applicant for a product licence to serve a notice
                    in a prescribed form to the patentee. The form is set out in the Sixth Schedule
                    of the Regulations and informs the patentee that the HSA may grant the licence
                    to the applicant unless the patentee applies “for a court order
                    restraining the act for which the licence is applied for or a declaration by a
                    court or the Registrar of patents that...the patent will be infringed by the
                    doing of that act.” Reading the provisions holistically, it is, in my
                    view, apparent that the legislature intended for an independent cause of action
                    to be provided pursuant to those provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Another way to arrive at the same conclusion
                    is by considering the alternative. If section 12A of the Medicines Act does, in
                    spite of the lack of any wording to that effect, refer a patentee to take out a
                    patent infringement action under the Patents Act, it would be almost impossible
                    for a patentee to obtain a “declaration...that the Patent will be
                    infringed” as contemplated by the provision. This is because it would be
                    almost impossible for a patentee to satisfy the practical requirement of a past
                    infringing act demanded by a patent infringement action in a situation where all
                    the applicant for a produce licence has done is to apply for a product licence.
                    As pointed out by the defendant himself, the case of <em>Upjohn v
                        Kerfoot</em> is authority for the proposition that the act of applying
                    for a product licence is not in itself an infringing act. Further, section
                    66(2)(h) of the Patents Act provides a blanket defence for any preparatory act
                    performed to support that application. The only way, in such a situation, for
                    the patentee to obtain the declaration contemplated by section 12A of the
                    Medicines Act, read with section 5B and the Sixth Schedule of the Regulations,
                    is if the applicant has committed an infringing act, as defined under section 66
                    of the Patents Act, which is not protected by any statutory or common law
                    defence. However, if that were the case, there would be no need to sue for a
                    “declaration... that the Patent will be infringed” as provided for
                    in section 12A of the Medicines Act. The patentee may simply take out a patent
                    infringement action under the Patents Act. Since this interpretation of section
                    12A of the Medicines Act (and its accompanying subsidiary legislation) makes a
                    part of the legislation redundant, it is unlikely that this would have been the
                    interpretation intended by Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     To be complete, it appears, in my view, that
                    an action for “a declaration...that...the patent will be
                    infringed” under section 12A of the Medicines Act is incompatible with
                        <em>any</em> action provided for in the Patents Act,
                    not just a patent infringement action. For instance, section 78 of the Patents
                    Act provides an avenue for the applicant of a product licence to seek a
                    declaration of non-infringement in respect of future hypothetical events but a
                    patentee does not appear to have the converse right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I therefore agree with counsel for the
                    plaintiff in this respect: section 12A of the Medicines Act, read with its
                    accompanying subsidiary legislation, contemplates a cause of action separate and
                    independent from a patent infringement action under the Patents Act. At the very
                    least, it cannot be said that the plaintiff’s case is wholly and clearly
                    unarguable and should be struck out on this point alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inherent jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In addition, it appears that the
                    plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) may be able sustain
                    an action for a declaration of future infringement under the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Generally, it is established law that the High
                    Court has the power to make binding declarations of right whether or not any
                    consequential relief is or could be claimed: see <em>Tan Ah Thee
                        and another (administrators of the estate of Tan Kiam </em><em>Poh (alias Tan Gna Chua), deceased) v Lim Soo </em><em>Foong</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 957 (“<em>Tan Ah Thee</em>”). This power is provided for in
                    section 18, read together with the First Schedule, of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>18.</b>-(1) The High Court shall have such
                        powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court
                        shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule.</p>

<b>14.</b> Power to grant all reliefs and remedies

                        for, an injunction or specific performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, that the court possesses such a power does not mean that it
                    should be exercised in every instance. Rather, the power is to be exercised
                    within the boundaries outlined in <em>Salijah
                        </em><em>bte </em><em>Ab
                        </em><em>Latef v Mohd </em><em>Irwan bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 233 (at
                        [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Firstly, the jurisdiction of the court to make a declaration of right is
                        confined to declaring contested legal rights, <b><em>subsisting
                            or future</em></b>, of the parties represented in the litigation.
                        Secondly, the remedy being a discretionary one, it will not be granted to a
                        plaintiff if it would not give him ‘relief’ in any real sense,
                            <em>ie</em> relieve him from any liability of
                        disadvantage or difficulty. Thirdly, the power to make a declaratory
                        judgment is confined to matters which are justiciable in the High Court.
                        Finally, it has been held that there is nothing in O 15 r 16 which
                        enables the court to make a declaration in a matter in which its
                        jurisdiction is excluded by a statute which gives exclusive jurisdiction to
                        another tribunal. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     To the best of my understanding, this general
                    position of law fairly reflects that of patent law as well. With regard to
                    patent law, it is established that the court has the inherent jurisdiction to
                    grant declarations of infringement or non-infringement that pertains to
                    prospective events. The caveat is that the prospective events cannot be purely
                    hypothetical; instead, there must be a “real commercial interest”
                    in obtaining the declaration: see <em>Nokia Corp v Interdigital
                        Technology Corp</em> [2007] FSR 23 (“<em>Nokia</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There was, in antiquity, some suggestion that
                    it is a requirement before a declaration of right is granted for the defendant
                    to have asserted a claim of right: see <em>Re Clay, Clay v
                        Booth</em> [1919] 1 Ch 66 (“<em>Re
                        Clay</em>”). However, the law has since moved on and the modern
                    position was eloquently set out by Lord Diplock in <em>Gouriet v
                        Union of Post Office Workers</em> [1978] AC 435 (at p.
                    501):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The power to grant a declaration is discretionary; it is a useful power
                        and over the course of the last hundred years it has become more and more
                        extensively used—often as an alternative to the procedure by way of
                        certiorari in cases where it is claimed that a decision of an administrative
                        authority which purports to affect rights available to the plaintiff in
                        private law is ultra vires and void. Nothing that I have to say is intended
                        to discourage the exercise of judicial discretion in favour of making
                        declarations of right in cases where the jurisdiction to do so exists. But
                        that there are limits to the jurisdiction is inherent in the nature of the
                        relief: a declaration of rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only kinds of rights with which courts of justice are concerned are
                        legal rights; and a court of civil jurisdiction is concerned with legal
                        rights only when the aid of the court is invoked by one party claiming a
                        right against another party, to protect or enforce the right or to provide a
                        remedy against that other party for infringement of it, or is invoked by
                        either party to settle a dispute between them as to the existence or nature
                        of the right claimed. <b>So for the court to have
                            jurisdiction to declare any legal right it must be one which is claimed
                            by one of the parties as enforceable against an adverse party to the
                            litigation, either as a subsisting right or as one which may come into
                            existence in the future conditionally on the happening of an
                            event.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The early controversies as to whether a party applying for declaratory
                        relief must have a subsisting cause of action or a right to some other
                        relief as well can now be forgotten. It is clearly established that he need
                        not. Relief in the form of a declaration of right is generally superfluous
                        to a plaintiff who has a subsisting cause of action. <b>It
                            is when an infringement of the plaintiff's rights in the future is
                            threatened or when, unaccompanied by threats, there is a dispute between
                            parties as to what their respective rights will be if something happens
                            in the future, that the jurisdiction to make declarations of right can
                            be most usefully invoked. </b><b>But the
                            jurisdiction of the court is not to declare the law generally or to give
                            advisory opinions; it is confined to declaring contested legal rights.
                            subsisting or future, of the parties represented in the litigation
                            before it and not those of anyone else.</b></p>

                        <em>Wyko Group Plc v Cooper Roller Bearings Co
                    Ltd</em>, [1996] FSR 126 (“<em>Wyko</em>”). In <em>Wyko</em>, the court
                    adopted three guidelines first laid down by Lord Dunedin in <em>Russian Commerical and Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign
                        Trade</em>, [1921] 2 AC 438 (at 448) in its determination of
                    whether to grant a declaration of non-liability as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the person
                        raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to secure
                        a proper contradictor, that is to say, someone presently existing who has a
                        true interest to oppose the declaration sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first and third of these guidelines were held not to be satisfied
                    in <em>Wyko</em>, a copyright case. In particular, the
                    claim was founded on hypothetical circumstances rather than an existing set of
                    facts. Further, it was held that the defendant had no true interest in opposing
                    the declaration and that he had merely taken part in a theoretical debate (in
                    the inter-solicitor correspondence).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     
          <em>Nokia</em> is an
                    example of a case in which it was found that the plaintiff had a “real
                    commercial reason” for seeking a declaration of non-infringement even
                    though the patentee-defendant did not make a claim against the plaintiff. In
                    that case, the plaintiff, Nokia Corporation, sought declarations that thirty
                    patents owned by the patentee-defendant, Interdigital Techonology Corporation,
                    were not required to comply with the internationally agreed 3G standard for
                    mobile phones. At first instance, the court refused the defendant’s
                    application to set aside the proceedings on the ground that the court had no
                    jurisdiction. This decision was upheld on appeal. Jacob L.J. explained (at
                        [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Nokia have a manifest and real commercial interest in a decision of
                        the kind sought. They are “technically infringing” if they are
                        wrong...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The case recent of <em>Nokia
                        Oyj v IPCOm GmbH &amp; Co KG</em> [2010] EWHC 3249 appeared
                    to have muddied the waters slightly by seemingly suggesting that the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction to grant declarations does not include the
                    power to grant declarations about future events. However, I do not believe that
                    that is a proper understanding of the case. It is paramount that, when
                    distinguishing between a declaration sought under section 71 of the UK Patents
                    Act and one under the court’s inherent jurisdiction, Mr Justice
                    Lewison had this to say (at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are at least three features of section 71 which distinguish it from
                        the court’s inherent jurisdiction to grant declarations. First,
                        section 71 enables the court to grant declarations about <b>future hypothetical</b> events. The ability to make declarations
                        is triggered merely by a proposal to do something. That proposal need not
                        even have got as far as a settled intention. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That the court will not grant declarations pertaining to events that
                    are both future <em>and hypothetical</em> is consistent
                    with the law as set out by an established line of cases, some of which have been
                    cited above. However, the situation is far different if the relevant events are
                    prospective but <em>real</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In short, the court may have the power to
                    grant the kind of declaration envisaged under section 12A of the Medicines Act,
                    read with section 5B and the Sixth Schedule of the Regulations, pursuant to its
                    inherent jurisdiction. In a case such as the present, there appears to be a real
                    commercial question to be answered. Given that the defendant has gone to the
                    trouble of applying for product licences in respect of the Proposed Products
                    from the HSA, it can hardly be said that the issue between the parties is a
                    purely hypothetical one. Indeed, the defendant has declared to the the HSA that
                    it intends to perform certain acts which, from the plaintiff’s
                    perspective, will infringe the plaintiff’s patent. Further, the plaintiff
                    has a real interest to raise the question; if it did not do so, the defendant
                    may have already obtained the product licences from HSA upon application.
                    Further, in order to prevent the defendant from being granted the product
                    licences after the 30-month moratorium, a determination on the dispute must be
                    obtained. For the same reasons, it cannot be gainsaid that the defendant has a
                    true interest to oppose the application sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Given that the plaintiff did not pursue this
                    avenue, however, I am loath to make any decided finding thereon; nor is it
                    necessary for me to do so given my earlier decision that section 12A of the
                    Medicines Act provides for an independent cause of action. I am hence satisfied
                    to leave this point to be determined on an occasion when the court has the
                    benefit of full arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the cause of action contemplated under section 12A of the
                Medicines Act allows for a patentee to maintain an action solely on the basis that
                it does not believe the reason for non-infringement proffered by the
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Even if section 12A of the Medicines Act does
                    provide for an independent cause of action, it remains to be decided what facts
                    must be pleaded to sustain that action. In the present case, the Statement of
                    Claim filed by the plaintiff is a fairly simple one. The plaintiff simply
                    recounted facts regarding the defendant’s application for product licences
                    and alleged that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The Plaintiff contends the following acts for which
                            the product licenses referred to in paragraph 4 are sought, namely (a)
                            disposal of the Defendant’s Products; (b) offer to dispose of the
                            Defendant’s Products; (c) using the Defendant’s Products;
                            (d) importing the Defendant’s Products; and (e) keeping whether
                            for disposal or otherwise of the Defendant’s Products; will
                            infringe claims 1 to 27 of Singapore Patent No. SG8993 if carried
                            out by the Defendant in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At this point, the plaintiff, of course, has no actual knowledge
                    of the composition of the Proposed Products. All that it knows of the Proposed
                    Products – they contain Rosuvastatin Calcium and do not utilise “an
                    inorganic salt in which the cation is multivalent” – was learnt
                    through the defendant's self-disclosure. The plaintiff essentially seeks to have
                    the defendant reveal the composition of the Proposed Products in order for the
                    defendant’s claim of non-infringement to be tested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As may be expected, the defendant takes
                    objection to this. The defendant suggests that it is generally incumbent upon a
                    plaintiff to prove its case. This should be done by, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, pleading relevant facts. In the present case, it is pointed
                    out that the plaintiff did not allege any facts in support of its allegation of
                    potential patent infringement. The plaintiff has also refused to provide
                    particulars on the basis that there are no acts of infringement being alleged.
                    As a result, the writ fails completely. The plaintiff’s claim, the
                    defendant contends, has no facts to stand on and is doomed to failure at the
                    outset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In my view, there is a disputed fact –
                    whether the Proposed Products contain “an inorganic salt in which the
                    cation is multivalent”. It is of course true that the plaintiff is,
                    currently, unable to plead any fact that would support its allegation that the
                    Proposed Products do contain that essential ingredient. Nevertheless, this state
                    of affairs, I believe, is precisely the scenario that the drafters of section
                    12A of the Medicines Act had envisioned the provision to apply to. The
                    legislative provisions make this clear. After being served with the notice under
                    section 12A(3) of the Medicines Act, a patentee is given only 45 days to take
                    out the section 12A application. In that space of time, it would be impossible
                    for the patentee to discover the composition of the applicant’s products,
                    particularly so when the applicant was not forthcoming. To expect the plaintiff,
                    at the point of filing its pleadings, to be able to plead facts to support its
                    allegation that its patent will be infringed would be unrealistic and not in
                    conformity with the spirit and intent of the relevant legislative
                    provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     This position is admittedly pro-patentee for
                    an applicant for a product licence is virtually forced to reveal the composition
                    of its products upon the taking out of an action by the plaintiff. Until that
                    point, no application for striking out of the plaintiff’s case is tenable.
                    However, this is not a position which the court has adopted. Rather, this is a
                    position that Parliament has taken through the enactment of the relevant
                    statutory regime. The court is not free to depart from the statutory regime
                    contemplated in the enactment of section 12A of the Medicines Act and its
                    accompanying subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It is also ventured that this reading of the
                    legislation puts the defendant’s products at risk. Should the Proposed
                    Products not contain “an inorganic salt in which the cation is
                    multivalent” as declared by the defendant, the defendant would have
                    revealed its trade secrets, so to speak, to the plaintiff. The plaintiff may
                    then take advantage of this for its own commercial benefit. After all, at this
                    point in time, the Proposed Products are not protected by a patent yet. However,
                    the risk may be mitigated. While it is true that the defendant will have to
                    reveal the composition of its products, there are ways provided by the
                    court’s procedures and rules which will allow the defendant to protect
                    itself. For instance, applications may be made for confidential information to
                    be restricted to certain persons or for the plaintiff to be made to undertake
                    not to use the information for purposes outside of the court action. Such
                    applications are not entirely new.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In its application to strike out the
                    plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1), the defendant also
                    alleges that the action is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of
                    process. Before me, this allegation was not pursued with as much force as the
                    allegation that the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) discloses no
                    reasonable cause of action but it must be dealt with in any case. In support of
                    this latest allegation, the defendant argues that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     the original Writ and Statement of
                        Claim was riddled with elementary mistakes such as misstating the name and
                        address of the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     there are other patents owned by the plaintiff to which
                        the Proposed Products also relate and for which additional notices were
                        served but the plaintiff has not commenced any action against the defendant
                        in respect of those patents;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff could not have known what patents it owned
                        related to the Proposed Products for it did not know of the composition of
                        the Proposed Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     the plaintiff, following the commencement of this action,
                        sought for discovery of documents that were overly intrusive and
                        onerous;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        plaintiff’s associated company has had its statement of claim in a
                        Canadian case struck out for lack of material facts in its pleadings;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        plaintiff have been found guilty of patent misuse in other
                        jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Taken holistically, I am not of the view that
                    these allegations, even if true, necessarily leads to the conclusion the
                    plaintiff is pressing upon the court – that the plaintiff does not
                    sincerely believe that its patent will be infringed and is simply instituting
                    the action to delay the defendant’s applications from being approved or to
                    obtain confidential information belonging to the defendant. While it is true
                    that the plaintiff’s associated company has had its statement of claim
                    struck out in <em>AstraZeneca Canada Inc v Novopharm
                        Limited</em> 2009 FC 1209, it is not at all clear to me that an action
                    similar to the one contemplated under section 12A of the Medicines Act was taken
                    out. Its probative value is therefore low. Nor I am persuaded that the present
                    action is the latest in the plaintiff’s attempts to abuse the patent
                    system. In the result, there is insufficient evidence to prove that the
                    plaintiff’s present action is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse
                    of the court’s process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the circumstances, the application is
                    dismissed. I will hear parties on costs.</p>
