<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">           

By this originating motion, Mr Jules Sher QC ("Mr Sher") sought ad hoc admission

under s 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) ("the Act") as an advocate and

solicitor of this court to appear on behalf of Singapore Telecommunications Limited

("SingTel"), the defendant in Suit No. 934 of 2001/Y ("the suit")

until its final disposal. In the suit, the plaintiff was claiming in restitution the sum

of $388 million from SingTel on the ground that in making that payment to SingTel as part

of the compensation it had made a mistake of law. Counsel for the plaintiff in the suit

did not object to the application. The representative of the Attorney-General left the

matter to the court. Counsel for the Law Society of Singapore, however, opposed the

application. Initially, I was reluctant to order the ad hoc admission and I pressed Mr

Shanmugam SC on the matter, commenting that he was working very hard out of a very

interesting brief. In the end I was persuaded that the three-fold test laid down in

Singapore by a long line of case-law was fulfilled. Bearing in mind the principles

governing the exercise of my discretion as laid down by s 21(1) of the Act and case-law, I

allowed the application. I now set out the background and the circumstances under which

the facts were applied in accordance with the principles governing the admissions of QCs.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Section 21 of the Legal Profession Act</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2        Section 21

of the Act states as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">       

"(1)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act,

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3        Mr Sher

obtained the degree of Bachelor of Commerce followed by an LL.B at the University of

Witwaterstrand, Johannesburg in 1964. He was awarded the degree Cum Laude and was awarded

the Society of Advocates’ prize for the best law student over the three years of the

LL.B course. He was called to the Bar in South Africa. He took the post-graduate Bachelor

of Civil Law at Oxford University, New College, in 1967 and was called to the Bar of

England and Wales in 1968 by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. He has practiced

at the Bar of England and Wales since then. In 1981 he was appointed one of Her

Majesty’s Counsel. He is a member of the Chancery Bar Association and the Commercial

Bar Association. In 1987 he was appointed a Recorder and a Deputy High Court Judge in the

Chancery Division in 1989 and more recently in the Queen’s Bench Division, Commercial

Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4        Mr Sher has

appeared as counsel in several cases in Singapore. At the time of his application he was

instructed in a very large scale litigation in the Cayman Islands and in Hong Kong and

other jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom he has appeared regularly in the High Court,

the Court of Appeal, the Privy Council and the House of Lords, both as junior and in silk.

He appeared in <i>William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire County Council</i> in the Court of

Appeal [1994] 1 WLR 1016 which was a case involving mistake in the realm of contract and

of relevance at the trial of the suit. He also appeared in <i>South Tyneside Metropolitan

Borough Council v Svenska International plc</i> [1995] 1 All ER 545 which involved the law

of contract and restitution and the defence of change of position, and which would also be

relevant to the issues in the suit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5        In the light

of the very impressive credentials of Mr Sher, it was obvious that the requirements of

special qualifications and experience under s 21(1) of the Act were not in issue before

me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6        For more

than 10 years our courts have been dilating on s 21(1) of the Act. It was noted that the

section was aimed at specifying some guidelines in the ad hoc admission of Queen’s

Counsel. The objective was to help develop a strong core of good advocates at the local

Bar, but it was also recognized that in the appropriate cases litigants would be allowed

to avail themselves of the services of QCs. The guidelines were most usefully set out by

Yong Pung How CJ in <i>Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC</i> <i>(No 2)</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=44207&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 440</a>

  the case in which he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient

  difficulty and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s

  Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the

  decision to admit is still a matter of the court’s discretion. At the second stage,

  therefore, the applicant must persuade the court that the circumstances of the particular

  case warrant the court exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he

  has to satisfy the court of his suitability for admission.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">7        <i>In Re

Flint Charles John Raffles QC</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61094&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 2 SLR 276</a> I had occasion to consider the import

of s21(1) of the Act. Mr Flint applied for ad hoc admission to appear for a Malaysian

company to recover substantial damages of about US$75 million against each of the then 30

defendants for, inter alia, conspiracy to defraud, equitable compensation and/or damages

for breaches of contract of employment, fiduciary duties or inducement of breaches of

contract and for dishonest assistance or as recipients of trust moneys. Local counsel in

that case had played prominent roles in the pre-trial preparation of the case and had

convincingly demonstrated before me in many interlocutory matters that he would ably

assist the plaintiffs and the court. Much of the crucial leg-work had been done and such

trial advocacy as would be required was well within the abilities of local counsel. I

formed the view that the opportunity must be offered to the local Bar to take up the

challenge and appear at the trial and conduct it. The nurturing of the local Bar was

endorsed by Yong Pung How CJ in <i>Re Howe Russell Thomas QC</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61941&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 3 SLR 575</a> para 7.

Yong CJ in that case stated clearly that that application "did not pass the first

stage of the test" which he laid down in <i>Re Caplan Michael QC</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8        In the light

of the pronouncements of our courts I went on to analyse the nature of the suit to

consider if it merited the ad hoc admission of a Queen’s Counsel.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The Facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9        The

plaintiff ("IDA") in the suit is a body corporate established pursuant to the

Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 137A). Its predecessor in

title and power was the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore ("TAS"), which

was established under the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 323)

("the TAS Act"), and which had made the payment in question. SingTel is a public

company incorporated in Singapore and is engaged in, among other things, the business of

providing telecommunication services in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10        On 1 April

1992 TAS granted SingTel a licence under the TAS Act to provide telecommunication services

to Singapore until 2017 with monopoly rights for the provision of basis telecommunication

services until 2007. In October 1993 SingTel’s licence was amended to provide that

TAS would have the right to licence additional operators to provide basic

telecommunication services from 1 April 2002 "provided those services were ancillary

and incidental to the principal services" provided by those operators ("the 1993

amendment").</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11        By a letter

to SingTel dated 11 May 1996, TAS gave notice pursuant to s 28 of the TAS Act of its

intention to modify a condition of SingTel’s licence. TAS stated that the

compensation payable for any damage caused by this modification was assessed by TAS to be

$1.5 billion and that SingTel was given 28 days from the date of service of that letter to

make representations to the proposed modification.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12        SingTel

replied and stated that they confirmed their acceptance of the proposed modification

referred to in TAS’s letter and the compensation of $1.5 billion for the damage to

SingTel, being SingTel’s "loss of profits in each of the years from 2000 to

2007, caused by the proposed modification." The quoted words reflected, evidently, a

desire to spread the losses over those years and reduced the quantum of income tax, if

any.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13        On receipt

of the letter, TAS by its Director-General called SingTel’s officers and said that

TAS was not agreeable to the form in which the letter was couched and requested that the

words "in each of the years from 2000 to 2007" be deleted. SingTel agreed to the

deletion. On the same day, TAS wrote to SingTel as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">" We refer to the letter …dated 30 May 1996

    and Singapore Telecom’s decision to delete the words <i>‘in each of the years

    from 2000 to 2007,</i>’ from paragraph 2 thereof.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">2     We note Singapore Telecom’s acceptance

    of  the proposed modification in our letter of 11 May 1996 and acceptance of the

    compensation amount of $1.5 billion for damage caused by the modification.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">3     This amount will be full and final

    payment."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14        On or about

31 March 1997 TAS paid the compensation sum of $1.5 billion to SingTel.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">15        On 4

October 2000, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore informed IDA and SingTel that no

tax would be payable on the compensation amount received by SingTel.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">16        By a letter

dated 14 March 2001 IDA as the successor in title requested SingTel to repay the amount

allegedly overpaid by TAS of $388 million. SingTel rejected the claim and refused to pay

the same. IDA commenced the suit in July 2001. The pleadings were exhibited in the

proceedings before me. The following issues arose from the pleadings and they were

summarised as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">"a.    Did TAS make a mistake of

    including in the compensation sum of S$1,500,000,000.00 a tax provision of S$388,000,000

    or did TAS assume the risk that tax may not be payable.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">  b.    Did the Defendants

    likewise make the same mistake or did they assume the risk that tax would be payable and

    if so at what rate and in over what timescale.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">c.    What was the state of the law as at

    the time the compensation sum was proposed with regards to the taxability of the

    compensation sum.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">d.    If TAS did make a mistake, was it a

    mistake of fact or law, or mixed fact and law.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">e.    If it was a mistake of law (whether

    wholly or in part), does that entitle the Plaintiffs to seek restitution of the

    S$388,000,000, i.e. is restitution for mistake of law a valid cause of action in

    Singapore. TAS followed the statutory procedure laid down in section 28 of the TAS Act in

    sending its letter of 11 May 1996 which embodied the statutory notice referred to in

    sub-section (2) of that section. That notice stated the proposed modifications to the

    Defendants’ licence and that the compensation payable would be S$1,500,000,000.00 to

    be paid on 31 March 1997. The Defendants had 28 days to object. Had they objected and had

    TAS either not changed its mind or amended the proposed modifications

    or compensation, the Defendants would have had 14 days to appeal to the Minister. As

    the Defendants did not object, TAS became statutorily obliged to carry out the

    modifications and statutorily obliged on 31 March 1997 to pay the Defendants the sum of

    S$1,500,000,000.00 being the sum specified in the statutory notice emobided in the letter

    of 11 May 1996. In the circumstances, even assuming there was a mistake in the original

    calculation of the S$1,500,000,000.00 inserted in the letter of 11 May 1996, the issue is

    settlement of the claim for compensation so that neither the Defendants nor TAS would be

    able to reopen the sum whether or not any one or more of the many assumptions of present

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">17        These

issues would span the law of restitution and contract and they raised important, difficult

and complex questions, amongst others, as to what would be the operative mistakes of law

which would kick in the restitutionary reliefs and the defences available in the light of

this newly recognized cause of action in the laws of Singapore. Several questions would

arise for the first time, which would require treatment by our courts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">18        Counsel for

the Law Society of Singapore submitted that the High Court had recently ruled that unjust

enrichment under a payment made under a mistake of law was reversible: see <i>Management

Corporation Strata Title No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62034&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 90</a>. He

expressed the view that Mr Shanmugam SC could with equal facility appear for SingTel and

would appear on its behalf and pursue with equal vigour the rights of SingTel as any QC

would.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">19        In

response, Mr Shanmugam SC observed that the law bearing on a restitutionary claim based on

mistake of law and the defences was obviously evolving. Many of the issues on what would

amount to an operative mistake of law and the defences would be new and had not been dealt

with in any jurisdiction in the world. The new cause of action would require delineation

and further amplification. Equally, the defences available to meet this restitutionary

claim, as foreshadowed by the issues outlined, would require careful consideration and

exposition. Elucidation and arguments by a Queen’s Counsel well versed in this new

branch of the law would be most desirable. That would be of great assistance to our

courts. Secondly, he pointed out that the Government of Singapore was a substantial

shareholder of SingTel. SingTel was concerned to ensure that the international investing

community, its shareholders, amongst whom were fund-managers, must be demonstrably

satisfied that the prosecution of its defence was being pursued with vigour and

determination.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">20        Having

considered the matter carefully, I formed the view that SingTel’s concern was

understandable. Like it or not, we had to address the perceptions (whether well-founded or

not) of the international and local market place. Whilst it was true that local counsel

could appear for SingTel adequately, that was one relevant factor to be considered in the

entire balancing exercise. I was also very mindful of the seminal issues which would

probably arise in this relatively new and evolving areas of the law of restitution which I

had personally followed with great interest over the last decade generally and

particularly since the decision handed down by the House of Lords in <i>Kleinwort Benson v

Lincoln City Council </i>[1998] 4 All ER 513, [1999] 2 AC 349. In my view, the three-fold

test referred to earlier was fulfilled and in the exercise of my discretion I allowed the

application.</font></p>
