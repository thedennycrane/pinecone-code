<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

JUDGMENT</strong></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. After delivery of my Judgment dated 29 February 2000 and pursuant to

my direction therein, counsel for the plaintiffs and the first defendant presented further

arguments before me on the question of costs. As I indicated I would, I now finalise my

orders for costs as between New Civilbuild (the plaintiffs) and Guobena (the first

defendants).</p>
<p align="justify">2. Counsel for Civilbuild quite naturally submitted that costs should

be awarded to his clients as they had succeeded in obtaining final judgment on their claim

for progress payments and retention monies totalling $1,813,981.95. Guobena on the other

hand, had failed in its claim for liquidated damages and had only been awarded

interlocutory judgment on their claim for advances made to New Civilbuild, which claim had

yet to be assessed; therefore, Guobena should pay the costs of the action.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Counsel for New Civilbuild had also inquired whether there was an

inconsistency between paras 71 and 100 of my Judgment. To recapitulate, in para 71, I had

pointed out that neither New Civilbuild nor Guobena had filed a defence to Tai Ping’s

counterclaim; I should have made it clear that it was counsel for Tai Ping who canvassed

this argument at the hearing of an earlier interlocutory application – that New

Civilbuild and Guobena were deemed to have admitted to Tai Ping’s counterclaim as a

matter of procedure. I should also have added that counsel for Guobena disagreed and

rightly so, that there was any requirement under the Rules of Court, for a defendant to

plead to the case of a co-defendant in the same suit. Consequently, there was no conflict

between para 71 and para 100 of my Judgment where I held that Tai Ping had failed in its

counterclaim against Guobena.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Finally, counsel asked for the refund of the security for costs

($15,000) furnished by New Civilbuild in favour of Goubena, on the direction of the

Registrar. I had refused to increase the amount of security when Guobena applied for the

same on 28 June 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Counsel for Guobena took a different approach on the issue of costs.

In his written submissions, he used a ‘scoreboard’ method based on the number

(8) of issues I had identified in my judgment (see para 12); in the process he arrived at

a score of 6 wins for Guobena and 2 for New Civilbuild. Consequently, counsel argued,

Guobena should be awarded costs against New Civilbuild for the action. In addition,

counsel applied for a certificate for two (2) counsel and submitted that the previous

order for costs I made (on 28 June 1999) in favour of New Civilbuild for amendments to the

defence should be reversed in his clients’ favour; I rejected both requests as being

without merit.</p>
<p align="justify">6. I shall first give my reasons for rejecting counsel’s requests.

Granted, there is provision under O 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court 1997 to award costs to a

party for more than one counsel for both getting-up as well as for court attendance. There

are however no set rules as to when and how the court should exercise its discretion under

that provision. I personally am of the view that a court should award a certificate for

two (2) counsel as an exception to the general rule that only one counsel should be

awarded costs. Such exceptional circumstances would include cases which involve a high

degree of complexity of facts and or law or, where there are many issues of both fact and

law and, trial is lengthy. Hence, in England it is not uncommon for the courts to award

certificate for not only two but three counsel, in infringement of trademark and patent

cases.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Undoubtedly, trial in this case was spread over 15 days in two (2)

tranches with an interval of four (4) months in between. However, that factor alone does

not warrant a successful litigant being awarded a certificate for two (2) counsel. He will

be adequately compensated by way of refresher for the break in the two portions of the

trial as well as for the length of the trial, by the taxing registrar. Counsel for Guobena

had submitted that the fact all parties were represented by two (2) counsel each was

indicative of how difficult the proceedings were. With respect, I disagree. The submission

is in any case inaccurate as there was only one counsel for New Civilbuild throughout the

proceedings. As for Guobena and Tai Ping, I am of the view they had two (2) counsel each

by choice and not necessity. The fact that I identified eight (8) issues does not mean

that there were complex legal issues involved or that the facts were convoluted. The

documentation was indeed voluminous but that is to be expected of any construction case

especially one where both liability and quantum were disputed. Again this factor will be

taken into consideration in the taxation process. I am also of the view that a test for

the applicability of O 59 r 19 must be whether it was reasonable of the defendants in this

case to appoint two instead of, one counsel; I think it was not.</p>
<p align="justify">8. As for Guobena’s argument on reversing my previous order for

costs in favour of New Civilbuild, this submission was no longer open to them as they

could have but failed to, appeal within the time stipulated under the Rules of Court.

Further, it would be a departure from the norm if I were to award costs in any event to

instead of against, a party applying for amendments at the very late stage which Guobena

did, in the midst of trial. Consequently, the sum of $5,000 which I awarded to New

Civilbuild pending taxation of their costs for those amendments (and presently held by

Guobena’s counsel as stakeholder) should forthwith be released to their counsel. </p>
<p align="justify">9. I turn now to the main issue of costs. One other argument put forth

by counsel for Guobena was, that it could not be said that New Civilbuild had succeeded in

their claim for progress payments on the merits as that was a concession by his clients

right from the start. That is correct from the point of view of Guobena’s pleadings

but that concession did not extend to allowing New Civilbuild to obtain final judgment

against the first defendants but with a stay of execution pending the outcome of

Guobena’s counterclaim. Indeed, Guobena applied to set aside New Civilbuild’s

ex-parte injunction by relying on their counterclaim. Therefore the concession did not

save the court’s time or the parties’ costs. As for the retention monies, no

concession at all was made by Guobena.</p>
<p align="justify">10. What is clear is that New Civilbuild succeeded in obtaining final

judgment on two (2) out of the three (3) claims pleaded in their statement of claim; I had

disallowed their claim in excess of $2m for costs incurred for variations works and for

damages resulting from delay in completion which I held was largely due to their own

fault.</p>
<p align="justify">11 As for Guobena, I had dismissed their claim for liquidated damages

which (after amendment) was reduced to $3m from $6,180,000. Consequently, based on the

particulars in para 29 of Guobena’s defence, what remains of their counterclaim

against New Civilbuild (when assessed) would at most, amount to $270,913, after taking

into account (which they must and have) the sum received from Tai Ping under the bond. </p>
<p align="justify">12. I had in para 97 of my Judgment, already reserved to the Registrar

the question of costs on assessment of the damages pursuant to the interlocutory

judgements awarded to New Civilbuild and Guobena on their respective claim and

counterclaim. Consequently the ‘scoreboard’ as it stands, using the methodology

adopted by counsel for Guobena, is that New Civilbuild have obtained final judgement (and

interlocutory judgment) in sums which exceed and would likely exceed what was awarded to

Guobena. In these circumstances, I am of the view for expediency, that there should be a

global order for costs in that New Civilbuild be given costs of the action but with <font face="Monotype Hadassah">ƒ</font> reduction to take into account Guobena’s

successful counterclaim, but with full disbursements up to judgment. Conversely, Guobena

are entitled to be reimbursed by New Civilbuild their full disbursements on a standard

basis, up to and including judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">13. Further, the sum of $15,000 paid into court by New Civilbuild as

security for Guobena’s costs cannot be withdrawn until the conclusion of the

Registrar’s assessment of damages. For the avoidance of further dispute between the

parties, New Civilbuild are not entitled to receive and Guobena are not obliged to pay,

the judgment sum of $1,813,981.95 pending the assessment. However, to ensure that New

Civilbuild are not prejudiced by any delay in the assessment process, I award them

interest at 6% on the said sum from date of writ (14 January 1998) until judgment (29

February 2000). </p>
<p align="justify">14. Finally, as I had not anticipated this undue delay between release

of my Judgement and the hearing on costs, I am rescinding my previous direction dated 28

November that for purposes of appeal, time runs from 29 February 2000. Instead, for

purposes of appeal on the question of liability only, time runs from the date of this

Supplemental Judgment. </p>
