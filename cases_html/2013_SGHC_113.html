<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Falmac Limited
                    (“Falmac”), was a Catalist Sponsor-supervised company at the time
                    it was de-listed by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd
                    (“SGX-ST”) on 22 August 2011. Prior to de-listing, Falmac’s
                    business operations were mainly carried out in Tianjin, People’s Republic
                    of China, through two subsidiaries, namely Falmac Machinery (Tianjin) Ltd
                    (“Falmac Machinery”) and Falmac Textile (Tianjin) Co Ltd
                    (“Falmac Textile”). For ease of reference, I shall refer to the
                    two subsidiaries collectively as the “Tianjin subsidiaries”. Each
                    subsidiary owned a factory in Tianjin (hereafter collectively referred to as
                    “the Tianjin factories”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This Writ of Summons was filed on 30 October
                    2009. It named five individuals who constituted Falmac’s board of
                    directors during the relevant period in question as the defendants (hereafter
                    collectively referred to as “the former board”). The first
                    defendant, Cheng Ji Jiang (“Ji Jiang”), the third defendant, David
                    Lu Hai Ge (“David Lu”), and the fifth defendant, Yu Wei Ying
                    (“Wei Ying”) were independent directors of Falmac. The second
                    defendant, Charlie Cheng Ji Lai (“D2”) was, at all material times,
                    a director and the Chief Executive Officer of Falmac. The fourth defendant, Fei
                    Xue Jun (“Fei”), was a director and shareholder of
                Falmac.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Falmac did not serve proceedings against Ji
                    Jiang, David Lu and Wei Ying, and the proceedings against Fei were formally
                    discontinued on 13 July 2010. The present action continues against
                D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mr Winston Quek (“Mr Quek”)
                    represents Falmac. During the first tranche of the trial, D2 was represented by
                    Mr L Devadason (“Mr Devadason”) who was assisted by Mr Harpal
                    Singh (“Mr Singh”). Mr Devadason fell seriously ill shortly
                    thereafter and Mr Singh took over the conduct of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview of the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In this action, Falmac pleaded a number of
                    breaches of fiduciary duties on the part of D2 involving a range of
                    transactions, dealings and matters. It was alleged, amongst other things, that
                    Falmac under the stewardship of D2 made losses yearly and was heavily indebted
                    to banks and other creditors, and that D2 had managed, conducted and
                    administered Falmac’s affairs without due care and diligence to the extent
                    that the company became financially crippled and could not pay its
                    employees’ salaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the end of the first tranche of the trial on
                    20 July 2011, Falmac’s core complaint was that D2 still controlled the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries through his nominee, Leon Zhao whose appointment as the
                    legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries was unauthorised as it was
                    without the knowledge and consent of Falmac (“the unauthorised legal
                    representative argument”). Falmac averred that Leon Zhao’s
                    appointment enabled D2 to continue to control the Tianjin subsidiaries for his
                    own personal interest and to the detriment of Falmac. As a result, Falmac lost
                    effective control of its principal assets which were the Tianjin
                        subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Attempts by
                    two new Falmac board members to gain access to the Tianjin factories in late
                    October 2009 were unsuccessful. To Falmac, this incident demonstrated
                    Falmac’s loss of physical control of the Tianjin factories.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to Falmac, Leon Zhao was a total
                    stranger. Not only was his appointment as the legal representative of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries unauthorised, the change of legal representative was not
                    disclosed to Falmac’s shareholders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In addition, Falmac was unable to remove Leon
                    Zhao as legal representative. Consequently, it was compelled to write off the
                    entire value of the Tianjin subsidiaries in its financial statements for the
                    financial year ended 31 December 2009 (“the 2009 financial
                    statements”). Falmac holds D2 responsible for the loss of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries by reason of D2’s breach of fiduciary duty and/or breach of
                        trust.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime after the first tranche of the trial,
                    Falmac obtained leave of court to re-amend its Statement of Claim (Amendment No
                    1) on 17 November 2011. With the new amendments (<em>ie</em>, Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) filed on 21 November
                    2011), the case against D2 took on a different dimension, namely that D2 had
                    disposed of the Tianjin subsidiaries to a company known as Sino Vision (HK) Ltd
                    (“Sino Vision”) in contravention of s 160(1) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, Rev Ed 2006) and in breach of his fiduciary duties owed to Falmac
                    (collectively referred to as “the s 160 complaint”). Falmac is
                    therefore seeking damages based on the net asset value of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries, or alternatively for damages to be assessed. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       D2 has denied any wrongdoing. His pleaded
                    defence is that the appointment of Leon Zhao as the legal representative of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries was not unlawful as it was approved by the former board,
                    and that the appointment was recognised and accepted by the authorities in
                    China. In relation to the s 160 complaint, D2’s defence is that the
                    debt-for-share transaction was approved by the former board in the interest of
                    Falmac. However, the former board had no role in the implementation of the
                    debt-for- share transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to D2, Business Corporate Services
                    Pte Ltd (“BCS”) and Peter Choo Chee Kong (“Choo”)
                    were interested in Falmac for a reserve takeover. In this case, the plan was to
                    use Falmac as the “shell” company for the reverse takeover.
                    Divesting Falmac of all its debt-ridden and loss-making businesses (<em>ie</em>, the Tianjin subsidiaries) was thus part of the
                    overall strategic restructuring of Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     D2’s overall position in his Closing
                    Submissions is that he is being made a scapegoat for the divestment of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries now that the reverse takeover has fallen through and the
                    white knights (<em>ie</em>, BCS and Choo) have lost money
                    in the process. It is D2’s contention that Falmac needed an excuse for
                    disposing the Tianjin subsidiaries for a consideration of S$2 to Unitex Global
                    Limited (“Unitex”). Thus, apart from the Tianjin subsidiaries
                    being loss-making, the easy way out was to blame D2 by alleging loss of
                    effective control of the Tianjin subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In this action, D2 counterclaims against
                    Falmac for various payments due to him such as unpaid salary as Falmac’s
                    Chief Executive Officer and unpaid director’s fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At this juncture, I propose to comment on the
                    state of the pleadings after the last round of late amendments in November 2011.
                    First, the unauthorised legal representative argument (see [6] above) and the s
                    160 complaint (see [8] above) appear to be advanced as discrete stand-alone
                    pleas. Falmac has not in its pleadings linked the unauthorised legal
                    representative argument to the s 160 complaint and the subsequent registration
                    of Sino Vision as the legal owner of Falmac’s shares in the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries. Falmac has not gone further to assert, and it is not
                    Falmac’s pleaded case, that D2 continues to be in effective control of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries despite the registration of Falmac’s shares in Sino
                    Vision’s name. Falmac is neither disavowing the Sino Vision transaction,
                    nor arguing that Sino Vision’s involvement was a sham or disguise to cover
                    up D2’s unlawful appropriation of the Tianjin subsidiaries. Simply put, it
                    is not Falmac’s pleaded case that D2 has an interest in Sino Vision, and
                    hence D2 has control of the Tianjin subsidiaries through Sino Vision and Leon
                    Zhao. In the absence of any plea of a causal link between the unauthorised
                    appointment of Leon Zhao on 1 September 2009 and the s 160 complaint they remain
                    discrete stand-alone pleas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Second, it is difficult for the court to work
                    out exactly what fiduciary obligation D2 had not observed, and the consequences
                    of any deviation from the same. Mere recitals of the various duties of a
                    director in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2), and mere
                    statements of conclusion that D2 had breached fiduciary duties owed to the
                    company do not suffice. The pleadings did not expressly identify the particular
                    obligation that D2 had supposedly breached as a fiduciary to the facts in
                    support of the complaint in question. Falmac’s Opening Statement referred
                    to a director’s duty to act honestly (<em>ie</em>, to
                    act <em>bona fide</em>) at all times in the interests of
                    the company. This was similar to the plea that D2 owed to Falmac a fiduciary
                    duty of good faith. An allegation of breach of duty of good faith is essentially
                    a charge of dishonesty. Like fraud, dishonesty must be distinctly alleged and
                    proved, and it is not permissible for a charge of dishonesty to be inferred from
                    the pleaded facts alleged against D2 in respect of either the unauthorised legal
                    representative argument or the s 160 complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Third, liability in the main action must
                    therefore be decided on the narrow formulation of the claims as pleaded and upon
                    the existence of cogent facts in evidence to support these claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Finally, the declaration sought by Falmac in
                    this court – that D2 was in breach of his duties as a director –
                    does not seem to be sought in respect of any loss suffered by Falmac or to
                    claims that might have been made to Falmac. There is a separate claim for
                    damages to be assessed. This claim, which is for common law damages, is not
                    intended as “the other relief” that follows a declaration of right
                    but is to recover compensation for breach of fiduciary duty owed to Falmac.
                    Accordingly, Falmac has to show that there is a causal connection between the
                    breach of fiduciary duty (<em>ie</em>, the relevant wrong)
                    and the relevant loss, if proved. Plainly, it is only in respect of the
                    unauthorised legal representative argument and the s 160 complaint that Falmac
                    is claiming damages based on the net asset value of the Tianjin subsidiaries and
                    the expenses incurred in attempting to recover the Tianjin subsidiaries. For the
                    other alleged claims described in [59] below, the sum total of the evidence is
                    that Falmac did not suffer any pecuniary loss. As Falmac is not asking this
                    court to declare contested legal rights of the parties, whether subsisting or in
                    the future, the relief in the form of a declaration of right is
                    superfluous.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronology of relevant events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A proper understanding of this action requires
                    the background facts of the case to be set out in some detail. A chronological
                    account of the relevant events is as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Former board comprising the five named defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At all material times, the primary business of
                    Falmac was in the manufacture of precision engineering circular knitting
                    machines and production of cotton yarn in Tianjin. It is common ground that
                    Falmac’s business was entirely derived from the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In October 2004, three of the named defendants
                    were on Falmac’s board: D2, David Lu and Fei. At that time, there was
                    another independent director, Lu Jing, on Falmac’s board. The fifth
                    director, Wei Ying, was appointed in March 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Lu Jing retired from the board in 2006. In
                    March 2006, Fei was appointed executive chairman of the board. However, he
                    stepped down as executive chairman in August 2007, but remained on the board as

                    D2, it was Fei who brought him into Falmac. In 2004, Falmac was in need of a
                    capital injection as well as a restructuring of loans with its creditor banks
                    amongst others. Fei as director of Sino Equity Group Limited (“Sino

                    Fei was also the chairman, Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder
                    made a cash injection into Falmac through an issue of new shares in Falmac. Fei,
                    through his interest in Sino Equity, became the largest shareholder holding 29%
                    of the issued shares in Falmac as at 12 March 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the Directors believe that a core part of the overall restructuring

                        liabilities and hence immediate cash requirements. As a result, debts owing
                        by the Company and the Group as of 27 October 2004 to the creditor banks
                        amounting to approximately $10.7 million had been capitalised into new

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Note 5 also disclosed that the Company was in
                    the process of re-negotiating with the creditor banks for a revised bank

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As things turned out, Falmac’s sale of
                    assets in Singapore was insufficient to repay the requisite S$2.1m leaving a
                    shortfall of S$250,000 unpaid. Falmac also defaulted in payment of three of the
                    repayment instalments that had fallen due and payable as of 31 December 2005.
                    Therefore, on 20 February 2006, the creditor banks demanded repayment of the
                    entire restructured loan together with interest amounting to a total of about
                    S$3.97m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Falmac’s defaults in payments under

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is clear that the ability of Falmac to
                    continue business as a going concern depended on the company realising assets to
                    discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, but as the current
                    liabilities of both Falmac and its subsidiaries continue to exceed its current
                    assets over the years, the auditors in Singapore found it increasingly difficult
                    to support the going concern basis of the company and its
                        subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Despite the fact that Falmac and its Tianjin
                    subsidiaries had crippling liabilities, Falmac was still an attractive target to
                    a white knight (in this case BCS and Choo) who perceived Falmac as a cheap and
                    easy way to secure a Catalist listing via a reverse takeover.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Enter Wong Lock Chee and Choo </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     BCS was a private investment company that was
                    owned and controlled by Wong Lock Chee (“Wong”) and Yeoh Wee Liat
                    (“Yeoh”). Wong, acting through BCS, bought over Falmac’s
                    outstanding debts at a discount from the creditor banks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> After 31 December 2008, the creditor banks
                    assigned all their interests and rights in relation to the bank loans, thus
                    making BCS a 16.5% shareholder as well as a substantial creditor in respect of
                    an outstanding loan of approximately S$4.5m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Falmac confirmed in its Closing
                    Submissions that this move by BCS to acquire 16.5% of the equity was “to
                    enable [Falmac] to undergo a debt restructuring plan and to negotiate with
                    corporate entities for a reverse takeover of [Falmac].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> BCS saw its role as a white knight and
                    committed funds to Falmac in a bid to buy time to implement its plan to
                    restructure the company’s debts for a reverse takeover. Wong had
                    approached Choo, a director and shareholder of CNMC Goldmine Limited
                    (“CNMC”) on the possibility of a reverse takeover of [Falmac] by
                    CNMC. Choo was said to be “keen on the proposal”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> the “proposal” was for Falmac to
                    acquire the entire stake in CNMC in exchange for the issuance of new shares in
                    Falmac, effectively allowing CNMC to achieve a “backdoor-listing”.
                    This ambition to buy Falmac for a “backdoor-listing” naturally
                    required the agreement and cooperation of the former board of Falmac. In fact,
                    there were e-mails from Choo to D2 expressing his seriousness in Falmac and that
                    he needed D2 to work with him. For a flavour of the overtures, some of these
                    e-mails are reproduced below. In an e-mail dated 20 January 2009 to D2, Choo
                        wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>

                        China’s law ministry. For example, China Aviation Oil’s CEO Chen
                        was jailed in Singapore with the help of China’s courts (Chen was
                        released from Changi prison today). So you and I should work closely to
                        close the current chapter on Falmac and then you move on.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Today newspapers in Singapore are reporting many failures of China-linked
                        companies and this caused many investors to avoid investing in such

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let’s work quickly on Falmac. Wong Lock Chee has compiled the

                        ahead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is not disputed that in practice, the debts
                    of the target company (<em>ie</em>, Falmac) have to be
                    restructured and a debt conversion exercise undertaken<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> in order to turn the target company into a
                    shell company before injection of a new business into the target company. In
                    this case, the plan was to use Falmac as the shell company for the reverse
                    takeover. Divesting Falmac of all its debt-ridden and loss-making businesses
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Tianjin subsidiaries) was thus part

                    Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) between Falmac and CNMC for
                    the reverse takeover. Recitals D and E of the MOU state:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(D) Falmac is currently being restructured into a shell company with
                        insignificant businesses and with old businesses to be divested and all
                        debts and obligations including banks, employees, shareholders loans being
                        settled amicably and so that it is clean and with no liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(E) This MOU is meant to facilitate the legal, financial and operational
                        due diligence investigations to be mutually conducted by parties hereto
                        (“Due Diligence Investigation”) and signing of a formal sale
                        and purchase agreement (“S&amp;P Agreement”) and is subject to
                        the terms and conditions of the S&amp;P Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The second and third agreements were
                    settlement agreements offered by BCS to D2 and Fei respectively in respect of
                    certain sums owed to them by Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> With regards to Fei, the draft
                    settlement agreement related to an outstanding shareholder’s loan. The
                    draft settlement agreement between D2 and BCS was for salary arrears capped at
                    S$1m and the settlement amount was to be paid upon completion of the reverse
                        takeover.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    Notably, it was a condition of the proposed settlement with D2 that he, amongst
                    other things, supported and procured the support of Fei to vote in favour of the
                    reverse takeover. Unfortunately, these two draft agreements were never finalized
                    and executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The fourth draft agreement was between BCS and
                    a company called Tianjin Kanbo Machinery Ltd (“Tianjin Kanbo”) for
                    the purchase of the Tianjin subsidiaries for a nominal fee of S$1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The name
                    “Tianjin Kanbo” as appears in the draft was provided by D2 to Choo
                    in an e-mail of 25 March 2009. In that e-mail, D2 informed Choo of Tianjin
                    Kanbo’s interest to buy the Tianjin subsidiaries at S$1, and that a Hong
                    Kong company by the name of “Superway Logistics Limited” would pay
                    S$100,000 for half of the six banks’ loan to Falmac. In the same e-mail,
                    D2 requested Choo to pass on this information to Wong who had called him earlier
                    that morning for the names.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The fifth draft agreement related to a
                    proposed sale of certain loans that BCS had earlier acquired from the creditor
                    banks of Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>
                    The name “Superway Logistics Limited” appears in the fifth
                    draft.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the interim period while administrative
                    steps were being taken for the reverse takeover, Choo and BCS provided financial
                    support to Falmac. For instance, Choo advanced loans to Falmac to settle
                    salaries and CPF contributions for Falmac’s employees. Choo also engaged
                    an independent firm, Bizcorp Management Pte Ltd (“Bizcorp”) to
                    take over Falmac’s financial reporting functions after the resignation of
                    Falmac’s finance personnel in late 2008. Due to these changes and other
                    difficulties in preparing financial statements, Falmac had sought and obtained
                    extensions of time to announce its 2008 financial results and hold its 2009
                    Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). Bizcorp was thus in charge of
                    preparing Falmac’s 2008 management accounts for the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The relationship between D2, Choo and Wong
                    appeared to have deteriorated after D2 refused to sign off on the 2008
                    management accounts (“2008 accounts”) prepared by Bizcorp. As a
                    result, the AGM could not be held by the required deadline (<em>ie</em>, 31 July 2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As stated, the defendant resigned as CEO of
                    Falmac with immediate effect on 20 July 2009. On 30 July 2009, the three
                    independent directors on the former board also resigned from their positions.
                    This left D2 and Fei as the only two members on Falmac’s board of
                    directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     After his resignation, D2 purportedly made
                    some statements that appeared in an article published by <em>The
                        Edge Singapore</em> magazine (<em>“The
                        Edge”</em>) on 17 August 2009. The article contained statements
                    relating to “accounting irregularities” and “false
                    accounting” within Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> A trading halt on Falmac’s
                    shares was called that same day. The next day, SGX-ST reprimanded Falmac for
                    lack of public disclosure in breach of the Listing Rules (the “Listing
                    Rules”), and asked Falmac to clarify the purported accounting
                    irregularities. On 21 August 2009, trading of Falmac’s shares was
                    suspended, allegedly causing negotiations on the proposed reverse takeover to
                    come to a temporary standstill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">New board of directors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     D2’s refusal to sign the 2008 accounts
                    provoked Choo and Wong into removing D2 as a director. On 5 August 2009, BCS
                    requisitioned an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EOGM”) to remove
                    D2 and Fei as directors of Falmac and appoint a new board of
                directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As a point of reference, the trading halt and
                    suspension (on 21 August 2009) occurred in the interim period between the
                    requisition for the EOGM and the subsequent election of the new board on 5
                    October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Initially, the EOGM was fixed for 28 September
                    2009. However, on 4 September 2009, D2 and Fei passed a resolution appointing
                    the firm of M/s Bih Li &amp; Lee to apply for an injunction on behalf of Falmac
                    to stop the convening of the EOGM (“the Bih Li &amp; Lee
                        resolution”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> D2 and Fei’s attempt to completely
                    stop the EOGM failed. D2 and Fei merely secured a postponement of the EOGM for
                    one week to 5 October 2009. At the EOGM held on 5 October 2009, D2 and Fei were
                    removed as directors of Falmac and a new board of directors was constituted. The
                    board members comprised Choo, Wong, Yeoh and Kuan Cheng Tuck
                    (“Kuan”) (hereafter collectively referred to as “the new
                    board”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first tranche of the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     After the new board was appointed on 5 October
                    2009, Falmac brought the present suit against the former board on 30 October
                    2009, alleging a host of breaches of director’s duties such as the failure
                    to convene Falmac’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) and
                    present the financial statements within the required deadlines. Falmac also
                    alleged that D2 in particular was in breach of fiduciary duties owed to Falmac
                    by, <em>inter alia</em>, failing to renew his employment
                    pass and making unwarranted statements about Falmac in <em>The
                        Edge</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On 8 September 2010, Falmac amended its
                    Statement of Claim to include allegations that D2 had unlawfully changed the
                    legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries, which resulted in the loss of
                    control of the Tianjin subsidiaries. It was alleged that D2 had resigned as the
                    legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries in favour of one Leon Zhao
                    whose appointment was on 1 September 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Chinese authorities approved the
                    change of legal representative to Leon Zhao on 13 October 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> According to Falmac,
                    Choo and Kuan were denied access and could not gain entry to the Tianjin
                    factories to retrieve the accounting and financial records of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries. Consequently, the accounts of the Tianjin subsidiaries for the
                    financial year ended 31 December 2009 were not audited, thereby hampering
                    Falmac’s preparation of its own consolidated financial statements for the
                    same financial year. It was also Falmac’s case that the loss of effective
                    control of the Tianjin subsidiaries caused the company to write off the entire
                    value of the Tianjin subsidiaries in Falmac’s 2009 financial
                    statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is pertinent to note that on 1 December
                    2009, Falmac passed two shareholder’s resolutions removing Leon Zhao as
                    the legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries in favour of one Pua Yeow
                        Seng<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> who
                    is the brother of Pua Yeow Chuan (“PYC”), a witness for Falmac at
                    the trial. PYC is the owner of Unitex Global Limited (“Unitex”)
                    with whom Falmac signed a sale and purchase agreement for the disposal of
                    Falmac’s shareholding in the Tianjin subsidiaries on 11 July 2011 (see
                    [127] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     On 29 October 2010, Falmac commenced legal
                    proceedings in China against D2 and Leon Zhao, seeking to invalidate the change
                    of legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> On 5 November 2010, the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries filed civil indictments against Leon Zhao for the return of
                    the company seals, business licences and other documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> However, all the legal
                    proceedings in China were withdrawn on 3 December 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The first tranche of the trial, which took
                    place in July 2011, was thus advanced on the basis that Leon Zhao was D2’s
                    nominee and that D2 was unlawfully controlling the Tianjin subsidiaries to the
                    exclusion of Falmac.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second tranche of the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Before the second tranche of the trial, Falmac
                    amended its case again, alleging that D2 had breached his fiduciary duties by
                    reason of the transfer of Falmac’s shares in the Tianjin subsidiaries to
                    Sino Vision without the approval of the shareholders of Falmac (<em>ie</em>, the s 160 complaint). Furthermore, Falmac pleaded
                    that D2 was in breach of his fiduciary duty for failing to disclose the transfer
                    to the shareholders of Falmac (“the non-disclosure
                        argument”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     This non-disclosure argument is a non-starter.
                    On Falmac’s own case, the organ of the company to which disclosure of the
                    transfer should have been made was the shareholders. It is settled law that a
                    director owes fiduciary duties to his company, not to the shareholders (see
                        <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> (Tan Cheng Han SC
                    gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2009) at para 8.127 (“<em>Walter Woon</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Returning to the narrative, D2 explained that
                    on 9 July 2009, the former board had passed a resolution to transfer the entire
                    equity in the Tianjin subsidiaries to Sino Vision by way of converting debts for
                    shares in the Tianjin subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> It is significant that Falmac is not
                    challenging this resolution. Its case is simply that shareholders’
                    approval must be sought, and no such approval was obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     According to D2, Leon Zhao was a director of
                    Tianjin Kanbo and he was its representative in the negotiations with D2 in July
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, Tianjin Kanbo used Sino Vision
                    as the contracting party because of the debts the latter entity had acquired
                    from the creditors of the Tianjin subsidiaries. Pursuant to the resolution of 9
                    July 2009, Falmac entered into two separate Equity Transfer Agreements
                    (“the Equity Agreements”) on 30 July 2009 with Sino Vision to
                    transfer Falmac’s shares in the Tianjin subsidiaries to Sino Vision. The
                    Equity Agreements were signed on behalf of Falmac by Wei Ying, one of the
                    independent directors on the former board (presumably before her resignation).
                    D2 accepted that the Equity Agreements were subject to formal approval of
                    shareholders, and that insofar as shareholders’ approval was concerned, it
                    was not for him to follow up on the formalities in the Equity Agreements as he
                    was no longer with Falmac as of 5 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As proof of the completion of the share
                    transfer in the absence of shareholders’ approval, Falmac produced
                    documents ostensibly from the Commercial and Industrial Bureau of Tianjin, the
                    authenticity of which was disputed by D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Falmac alleged numerous breaches of fiduciary
                    duty on the part of D2, and they are grouped under the following
                    categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_1"></a>(1)     Failure to comply with various
                        provisions of the Companies Act and the Listing Rules relating to the
                        convening of an AGM and the preparation of financial
                    statements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_2"></a>(2)     Failure
                        to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act and the Listing Rules
                        relating to directors of Falmac;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_3"></a>(3)     Non-disclosure to SGX-ST of a Chinese judgment against
                        Falmac Machinery;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_4"></a>(4)     Passing of the resolution on 4 September 2009 to appoint Bih Li &amp;
                        Lee to act for Falmac without the consent or approval of
                    Falmac;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_5"></a>(5)     Disclosure
                        of information to <em>The Edge</em> which resulted in
                        the suspension of Falmac’s shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_6"></a>(6)     Causing Falmac to lose control and ownership

                        subsidiaries to Sino Vision without shareholders’
                    approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Conversely, D2 averred that he had at all
                    times complied with his duties as a director to Falmac. In addition, D2 brought
                    a counterclaim for salary arrears and other sums owed under his employment
                    contract with Falmac.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Directors’ duties: the legal framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It should be noted at the outset that the
                    Companies Act and the Listing Rules apply here, as this case primarily concerns
                    the relationship between a Singapore-incorporated company listed on the SGX-ST
                    and its former board of directors. This is notwithstanding the fact that certain
                    underlying contracts were governed by Chinese law, or that some of the parties
                    involved were foreign nationals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It is trite law that every director owes
                    certain duties as a fiduciary to his company. As Millet LJ explained in
                        <em>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</em>
                    [1998] 1 Ch 1 at 18:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty.
                        The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary.
                        This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith;
                        he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a
                        position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for
                        his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed
                        consent of his principal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In addition to these general duties are the
                    specific duties imposed on directors by statute. Under s 157(1) of the Companies
                    Act, a director has the duty to “act honestly and use reasonable
                    diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office”. The duty to act
                    honestly has been interpreted as referring to the common law duty of a director
                    to act <em>bona fide</em> in the interests of the company
                    (see <em>Lim Weng Kee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2002] 2
                    SLR(R) 848 (“<em>Lim Weng Kee</em>” at
                    [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The Court of Appeal in <em>Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> [2007] 2 SLR (R) 597 (“<em>Townsing</em>”) held that s 157 (1) duty to act honestly in
                    discharge of his duties as a director is equivalent to the common law duty to
                    act bona fide, and that the duty of honesty and duty to act bona fide may be
                    regarded as a composite obligation. The two duties “impose a <em>unitary</em> obligation to act <em>bona
                        fide</em> in the interests of the company <em>in the
                        performance of the functions attaching to the office of
                    director</em>” (<em>Townsing</em> at
                    [59]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The duty to exercise reasonable diligence also
                    encompasses the duties of care and skill (<em>Walter
                        Woon</em> at para 8.13). The relevant standard of care and diligence
                    is objective, <em>ie</em>, whether the director has
                    exercised the same degree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found
                    in his position, and may be raised if the director possesses some special
                    knowledge or experience (see <em>Lim Weng Kee</em> at
                    [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Other specific duties imposed on directors by
                    statute include the requirements to make and retain adequate financial
                    records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Notably, a breach of a director’s
                    statutory duty, which may well give rise to certain consequences under statute,
                    does not <em>ipso facto</em> result in a breach of
                    fiduciary duty. Persistent failure to comply with obligations as regards the
                    filing of accounts and returns may amount to unfitness to hold appointment as a
                    director under s 155 of the Companies Act. Such failures, however, need not
                    involve any dishonest intent; nor would such conduct constitute a breach of
                    fiduciary duty. Thus, it is necessary to have in mind that in order for a
                    particular act or omission to constitute a breach of fiduciary duty, it must
                    fall within the various obligations of a fiduciary that reflect the core duty of
                    loyalty recognised at common law, or the duties that fall within the scope of
                    director’s duties as defined under s 157 of the Companies
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In reviewing the conduct of a director in
                    relation to decisions of a business and commercial nature, the court does not
                    substitute its own judgment for that of the directors. As stated in <em>ECRC Land Pte Ltd v Ho Wing On Christopher</em> [2004] 1
                    SLR(R) 105 at [49]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court should be slow to interfere with commercial decisions taken by
                        directors ... It should not, with the advantage of hindsight, substitute its
                        own decisions in place of those made by directors in the honest and
                        reasonable belief that they were for the best interests of the company, even
                        if those decisions turned out subsequently to be money-losing ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     With the legal framework in mind, I now turn
                    to consider the various allegations against D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outline of discussion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It is plain from the way Falmac developed its
                    case that many of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty that kicked off the
                    litigation on 30 October 2009 were ill-conceived, and the company in its Closing
                    Submissions continued to pursue them even though there was no related monetary
                    loss to the company. These alleged breaches are those grouped under the first
                    four categories (items (1) to (4)) in [59] above (hereafter collectively
                    referred to as “the secondary claims”). I propose to deal with
                    these secondary claims later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     This judgment will first discuss the main
                    areas of dispute based on the development of the case each time the pleadings
                    were amended by Falmac. The main areas of dispute are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_1"></a>(1)     The suspension of trading in August
                        2009; and</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Suspension of trading in August 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     
          <em>The Edge</em>
                    published an article on 17 August 2009 containing certain controversial
                    statements apparently made by D2. The relevant portion from the article is set
                    out below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Even more worrying, Cheng says that he discovered a lot of accounting
                        irregularities after being hired to run the company in 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“When I came in, there was a lot of false accounting and the
                        company owed money to suppliers and banks,” Cheng says. “They
                        reported huge receivables and inventory, but it was all fake. The
                        receivables were more than 90 months old and the inventory was full of
                        obsolete machinery.” Cheng adds that he even discovered that some of
                        Falmac’s customers didn’t exist. “I reported that to the
                        Commercial Affairs Department, but they told me it’s a civil
                        matter.” According to Cheng, Falmac’s employees also filed a
                        complaint with the Ministry of Manpower late last year after the company
                        failed to settle their back wages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     This article resulted in a trading halt that
                    was followed by a suspension of Falmac’s shares three days later. The
                    trading halt was called on Falmac’s shares on 17 August 2009; the next
                    day, the SGX-ST asked Falmac to make an announcement to clarify the statements
                    made in the article. D2 responded on 19 August 2009. On 21 August 2009, trading
                    of Falmac’s shares was suspended, as there was a limit of three days for a
                    trading halt. After the suspension, D2 responded to the SGX-ST and later sent a
                    draft announcement to the SGX-ST to clarify his comments in the article on 23
                    August 2009. The draft announcement prepared by D2 was not satisfactory and
                    SGX-ST asked Choo to assist on 28 August 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> After D2 was removed as director, the
                    new board provided the clarification sought by SGX-ST on 7 January
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Wong
                    confirmed that SGX-ST was finally satisfied with Falmac’s explanation as
                    there was no further inquiry thereafter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is noteworthy that when the Writ of Summons
                    was filed on 30 October 2009, Falmac’s main grievance with D2, in reality,
                    was the article itself that was published in <em>The
                        Edge</em>. What D2 did was perceived by Wong to be a spiteful attempt
                    to sabotage BCS and Choo’s reverse takeover. It was seen as D2’s way
                    of retaliating against BCS who had requisitioned for an EOGM to remove D2 as a
                        director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The concern then was that the
                    suspension could jeopardise the reverse takeover. As such, Falmac’s
                    pleaded case concentrated on the suspension in the following terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The suspension had affected the reputation and valuation of [Falmac].
                        Potential investors are shying away from investing in Falmac. If the
                        suspension is not lifted and it leads to the ultimate de-listing of [Falmac]
                        from the Stock Exchange, the value of [Falmac] will become practically
                        worthless. The Defendants’ gross negligence and lack of due care has
                        caused [Falmac] to lose its only and most valuable asset which is its listed
                        status in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Although the new board’s clarification
                    on 7 January 2010 was accepted by SGX-ST, trading of Falmac’s shares
                    remained suspended. It is important to note that the suspension continued for
                    different reasons. Simply put, although the article in <em>The
                        Edge</em> was the spark that triggered Falmac’s trading
                    suspension, it was not the factor that eventually brought about Falmac’s
                    de-listing on 22 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I start with the requirement to submit a
                    resumption proposal to lift the suspension after SGX-ST accepted Falmac’s
                    explanation of the matters reported in <em>The Edge</em>.
                    Pursuant to Rule 1304(1) of the Listing Rules, Falmac was required to submit a
                    resumption proposal to SGX-ST to resume trading of Falmac’s shares within
                    12 months of the date of suspension, <em>ie</em>, by 21
                    August 2010. During the period of suspension, however, Wong and Choo still
                    worked towards accomplishing the reverse takeover. As an illustration, Falmac
                    announced on 9 March 2010 the execution of the contract with CNMC to acquire all
                    the shares in CNMC on 8 March 2010 (“the CNMC contract”).
                    Subsequently, on 24 December 2010, Falmac announced the agreement of Falmac and
                    CNMC to extend the Long-Stop Date under the CNMC contract from 31 December 2010
                    to 31 March 2011 with a further option to extend the Long-Stop Date by another
                    three months to 30 June 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Falmac needed time to complete the due
                    diligence exercise for the reverse takeover by CNMC. This included geological
                    survey reports and the audit of CNMC’s financial statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Hence, on 22 December
                    2009, Falmac applied for time extension until 30 April 2011 to submit the
                    resumption proposal as it could not submit a resumption proposal by the original
                    deadline of 21 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Contemporaneously, as part of Choo’s
                    asset injection plan, the new board announced on 28 December 2009 that it
                    intended to divest Falmac’s shareholding in the Tianjin subsidiaries. As
                    mentioned earlier, BCS and Choo were interested in Falmac as a shell in order to
                    inject a new business into Falmac. Falmac thus resolved to divest the
                    loss-making Tianjin subsidiaries and to write off the investment costs of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Such
                    a move was risky in that Falmac might not be able to satisfy SGX-ST that it was
                    a “going concern” pursuant to Rule 1303(3) of the Listing Rules,
                    which was one of the criteria for resuming trading in Falmac’s shares, as
                    Falmac had no other business in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> So as not to fall foul of the relevant
                    Listing Rules, it was imperative that Falmac submitted the resumption proposal
                    with a viable business before the deadline of 30 April 2011. Wong himself agreed
                    in cross-examination that Falmac would have been queried and would be de-listed
                    if the Tianjin subsidiaries were disposed of without a viable replacement
                    business. In other words, SGX-ST had to be satisfied with Falmac’s
                    resumption proposal involving CNMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     On 28 April 2011, Falmac submitted its
                    resumption proposal in relation to the CNMC contract to acquire 100% of the
                    share capital of CNMC to SGX-ST.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Unfortunately, Falmac’s
                    resumption proposal was not acceptable to SGX-ST. As a result, SGX-ST duly
                    de-listed Falmac on 22 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In these circumstances, the delays in getting
                    the suspension lifted were <em>no</em>t due to D2. There
                    was clearly no causal link between the trading suspension arising from the
                    article in <em>The Edge</em> and the factors that led to
                    eventual de-listing on 22 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It is now convenient to look at Wong’s
                    explanation in cross-examination regarding the resumption of trading
                        proposal:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     For the reasons above, there is no merit in
                    Falmac’s contention that D2 was responsible on account of the article in
                        <em>The Edge</em> for Falmac’s diminished
                    reputation and value as a result of the trading suspension.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of the Tianjin subsidiaries</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Statement of Claim was amended on 8
                    September 2010 (<em>ie</em>, Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No 1)) to introduce another cause of action. By this amendment, Falmac claimed
                    that it lost control of the Tianjin factories due to D2’s unlawful change
                    of the legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries to his nominee, Leon
                    Zhao. It was argued that D2 continued to control the Tianjin subsidiaries as
                    their <em>de facto</em> legal representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The material facts must be borne in mind in
                    assessing the veracity of this plea. Based on the documentary evidence, the new
                    board was aware of Leon Zhao’s appointment at least since 1 December 2009
                    but did not amend the Statement of Claim until 9 months later. On 1 December
                    2009, Falmac as the 100% shareholder of the two Tianjin subsidiaries passed two
                    resolutions removing Leon Zhao as the legal representative of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries in favour of Pua Yeow Seng. On 20 March 2010, Falmac announced in
                    the Straits Times that the appointment of Leon Zhao was
                        unauthorised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Falmac raised no objection or protest to D2
                    that Choo and Kuan had been denied access to the Tianjian factories on 20
                    October 2009. Apparently, no subsequent attempts were made to visit the Tianjin
                    factories. In fact, Falmac filed the amendments on 8 September 2010 even before
                    Falmac sued D2 and Leon Zhao in China on 29 October 2010 and before the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries sued Leon Zhao for the return of the company seals and business
                    licences on 5 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Falmac claimed that it lost effective control
                    of the Tianjin subsidiaries by reason of the unauthorised change of the legal
                    representative, and denial of access to the Tianjin subsidiaries including
                    D2’s refusal to return the company seals and business licences. Therefore,
                    Falmac’s aggregate loss which is based on the net assets of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries is RMB 47,435,365. 92 (for ease of reference and reading, this
                    figure is rounded down to RMB 47m in this Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     There was a further amendment to the Statement
                    of Claim in November 2011 (<em>ie</em>, Statement of Claim
                    Amendment No 2)) such that by the second tranche of the trial, Falmac was
                    claiming that D2 had transferred Falmac’s shares in the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries to Sino Vision in breach of s 160 of the Companies Act and in
                    breach of his fiduciary duties owed to Falmac (<em>ie</em>,
                    the s 160 complaint). Section 160 of the Companies Act read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Approval of company required for disposal by directors of company’s
                        undertaking or property</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        the company’s undertaking or property unless those proposals have been
                        approved by the company in general meeting.</p>

                        subsection had been complied with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I commented on the state of the pleadings
                    after Falmac’s last amendment in November 2011 in [13] above. It must
                    again be remembered that there is no averment of a causal link between the two
                    complaints, namely the unauthorised appointment of Leon Zhao as legal
                    representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries on 1 September 2009 and the s 160
                    complaint. Notably, it is not Falmac’s pleaded case that D2 has an
                    interest in Sino Vision and that he continues to have <em>de
                        facto</em> control of the Tianjin subsidiaries through Sino Vision and
                    Leon Zhao.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The unauthorised legal representative argument </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether D2 was the <em>de facto</em>
                legal representative of the Tianjin subsidiaries after 1 September 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Falmac contended that the change of legal
                    representative was unlawful, and that it was D2’s way of controlling the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries even after his departure from Falmac. Falmac’s
                    pleaded case is that the change of legal representative was effected without the
                    approval and knowledge of the Falmac’s board of directors and/or
                    shareholders. It is worth noting that it was only in the Reply and Defence to
                    Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) that Falmac asserted that Leon Zhao was D2’s
                    nominee, that D2 appointed Leon Zhao as the legal representative in order to
                    gain control of the Tianjin subsidiaries, and that D2 was the <em>de facto</em> legal representative of the Tianjin
                        subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Mr Quek in his Closing Submissions referred to
                    the respective Articles of Association of the Tianjin subsidiaries, which
                    prescribed that approval of a change of legal representative must be given by
                    the shareholders. In this case, it was Falmac who had to give the approval but
                    contrary to D2’s assertion, there was no board resolution from Falmac to
                    this effect. Mr Quek relied on the evidence of Dorothy Ho, the company
                    secretary, who testified that she had not seen such a board
                resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Mr Quek relied on several matters to prove
                    that D2 remained in control of the Tianjin subsidiaries as <em>de
                        facto</em> legal representative after 1 September 2009. They are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_1"></a>(1)     Absence of knowledge on the part of
                        Falmac as to who Leon Zhao was. Moreover, Leon Zhao had never reported to
                        Falmac since his appointment as legal representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_2"></a>(2)     Falmac was unable to change the legal
                        representative from Leon Zhao to Falmac’s authorised representative,
                        Pua Yeow Seng, because it did not have the company seals and business
                        licences. D2 did not return these items to Falmac following his departure
                        from the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_3"></a>(3)     On the instructions of D2, Choo and Kuan were prevented from gaining
                        access to the Tianjin factories on 20 October 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_4"></a>(4)     D2 was seen at a trade exhibition held
                        in Shanghai on 14 June 2011. The Tianjin subsidiaries had a booth at this
                        exhibition, and D2 was introduced to PYC of Unitex as the boss of the
                        Tianjin subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     First of all, the plea that Leon Zhao was
                    D2’s nominee whom he used in order to gain control of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries to Falmac’s detriment is essentially a charge of dishonesty.
                    As stated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Townsing</em> at
                    [60], a director’s duty of honesty (or the duty to act in good faith) is a
                    facet of a fiduciary’s core duty of loyalty. In its Closing Submissions,
                    Falmac maintains that D2 changed the legal representative to Leon Zhao
                    “in order to keep [the Tianjin subsidiaries] out of the reach of [Falmac]
                    whilst he still remains in control of the said subsidiaries through Leon
                        Zhao.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In the context of pleadings involving fraud
                    and dishonesty, the following observations of Millet LJ in <em>Paragon Finance Plc v BB Thakerar</em> [1999] 1 All ER 400 (at 407)
                    are apposite here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well established that fraud must be distinctly alleged and as
                        distinctly proved, and that if the facts pleaded are consistent with
                        innocence it is not open to the court to find fraud. An allegation that the
                        defendant ‘knew or ought to have known’ is not a clear and
                        unequivocal allegation of actual knowledge and will not support a finding of
                        fraud even if the court is satisfied that there was actual knowledge. An
                        allegation that the defendant had actual knowledge of the existence of a
                        fraud perpetrated by others and failed to disclose the fact to the victim is
                        consistent with an inadvertent failure to make disclose and is not a charge
                        of fraud. It will not support a finding of fraud even if the court is
                        satisfied that the failure to disclose was deliberate and dishonest. Where
                        it is expressly alleged that such failure was negligent and in breach of a
                        contractual obligation of disclosure but not that it was deliberate and
                        dishonest, there is no room for treating it as an allegation of
                        fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The plea that Leon Zhao was D2’s nominee
                    was premised on the assertion that Leon Zhao was a stranger to the new board.
                    Such a plea is not enough to satisfy the rules of pleadings elucidated above.
                    There must be something about the appointment of Leon Zhao, some conduct which
                    is dishonest before a breach of fiduciary duty of good faith can be
                    established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It is pertinent to note that dishonesty as
                    director was not put to D2 in cross-examination nor specifically alleged against
                    D2 in pleadings. Like fraud, dishonesty must be distinctly alleged and proved,
                    and it is not permissible for a charge of dishonesty to be inferred from the
                    pleaded facts alleged against D2 (<em>ie</em>, to be
                    inferred from the pleaded facts such as Leon Zhao was a stranger, that D2 acted
                    without Falmac’s consent or knowledge and that the change of legal
                    representative was done surreptitiously).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In addition, there is the principle that the
                    more serious the allegation, the more cogent the evidence required must be to
                    prove dishonesty, even on the balance of probabilities. In assessing the
                    evidence, I bore in mind this principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Wong’s evidence is that Leon Zhao never
                    contacted Falmac. Zhang Shuren (“Zhang”), the former General
                    Manager of Falmac Machinery, said that whilst he was still employed by Falmac
                    Machinery, he never saw Leon Zhao. On the other hand, D2 denies any involvement
                    or interest whatsoever in the Tianjin subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> D2’s evidence is that Leon
                    Zhao was Fei’s choice as legal representative. According to D2, Leon Zhao
                    was a director of Tianjin Kanbo. D2 was not particularly challenged on this
                    aspect of his testimony. Moreover, I was not persuaded that Choo, who had
                    previously spoken to Fei, had actually checked this important matter with Fei.
                    Choo claimed to have asked Fei who Leon Zhao was but could not remember
                    Fei’s answer because it was not clear. If as Choo reasoned that the
                    identity of Leon Zhao was an obvious point to raise with Fei, and that upon
                    checking Fei did not give him a clear answer, the natural thing to do was to
                    press for a comprehensible answer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> This
                    was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In my view, Falmac has not established on the
                    evidence that the appointment of Leon Zhao as the legal representative of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries was unlawful. As of 1 September 2009, only D2 and Fei were
                    the remaining board members of Falmac; both had approved Leon Zhao’s
                        appointment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> I have earlier mentioned D2’s
                    evidence that it was Fei who had chosen Leon Zhao as the legal representative
                    (see [98] above). During cross-examination, Wong conceded that the change of
                    legal representative from D2 to Leon Zhao was approved by Falmac’s former
                    board of directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Having regard to the fact that the change of
                    legal representative took place during the incumbency of the former board, it is
                    not surprising that Falmac’s pleaded case is that D2 was in breach of
                    fiduciary duty for not informing the shareholders of the change of legal
                    representative (see [7] above). This plea is a non-starter seeing that directors
                    of a company generally do not owe any fiduciary duties to the shareholders (see
                        <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 8.127).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I noticed that with the exception of D2, the
                    board members of the Tianjin subsidiaries were apparently different from the
                    former board. Although the minutes of the former board’s resolution had
                    not been discovered, the minutes of the resolutions passed by the board members
                    of the Tianjin subsidiaries together with Falmac’s letters of appointment
                    (signed by D2) approving the appointment of Leon Zhao were
                        disclosed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Notably, Falmac accepted the authenticity
                    of the minutes of the board resolutions of the Tianjin subsidiaries that
                    approved Leon Zhao’s appointment as legal representative of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries as well as the authenticity of Falmac’s letters of
                    appointment approving the appointment of Leon Zhao. All these documents were put
                    together in an Agreed Bundle of documents whereby authenticity of the documents
                    was accepted by consent but not the contents thereof. See generally <em>Goh Ya Tian v Tan Song Gou and others</em> [1981]-[1982]
                    SLR(R) 193 on meaning and effect of agreed bundles of documents at trial. The
                    appointment of Leon Zhao was approved by the Commerce Commission of
                        Ninghe.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Again, Falmac accepted the authenticity of the
                    Commerce Commission’s certificate in the Agreed Bundle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Falmac’s case is that the change of
                    legal representative was to pre-empt the removal of D2 as a director of Falmac.
                    Mr Quek pointed to the timing of the change of legal representative which took
                    place immediately after BCS requisitioned for the EOGM on 5 October 2009 to
                    remove D2 and Fei as directors of Falmac. It is unclear how this contention
                    assists Falmac. If D2 had wanted to retain control of the Tianjin subsidiaries,
                    there was really no need for D2 to relinquish his position as legal
                    representative to Leon Zhao. The loss of directorship in the holding company,
                    Falmac, would not have any practical effect on his status as legal
                    representative seeing that: (a) the board members of the Tianjin subsidiaries
                    were different from the former board save for D2, (b) D2 was a board member of
                    the Tianjin subsidiaries, and (c) on Falmac’s own case, D2 retained the
                    company seals and business licences of the Tianjin subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    There is evidence that D2 advised
                    Falmac’s external auditors in Singapore that he had stepped down as
                    Chairman of the Tianjin subsidiaries and held no other appointment. In an e-mail
                    dated 19 October 2009 to Celine Lim, the manager of Falmac’s external
                    auditors (who had earlier written to D2 for information on 15 October 2009), D2
                        wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I refer to your email on 15 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please note that I have resigned in September this year, as the Chairman

                        companies. My appointment as Chief Executive Officer and director of Falmac

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Falmac was aware of Leon Zhao’s
                    appointment before 1 December 2009. But Falmac only announced that D2 had
                    changed the legal representative without the approval of Falmac on 9 March 2010.
                    It also made the same announcement in the Straits Times on 20 March 2010. Wong
                    admitted that the new board never wrote to D2 objecting to Leon Zhao’s
                        appointment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Mr Singh, acting for D2, drew the
                    court’s attention to Falmac’s misleading evidence. The impression
                    Falmac wanted to give the court was that it had tried to get back the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries but was unsuccessful. This impression was untrue. First, the civil
                    indictments in China were not even served against D2 and Leon Zhao. The
                    inability to serve the civil indictment on D2 to invalidate Leon Zhao’s
                    appointment had nothing to do with D2 evading service, as Falmac led the court
                    to believe. D2 had given to the company secretary his residential address in
                    Shanghai which was the same address Wong used to communicate with D2 on 29
                    October 2009 to advise him of his removal as legal representative of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries. However, Falmac did not give D2’s residential address in
                    Shanghai to its lawyers in China from Tianjin Yidao Law Firm. This was confirmed
                    by the witness, Liu Yan, a lawyer from Tianjin Yidao Law Firm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Second, while the civil indictment
                    against Leon Zhao was for the return of the common seals,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> no such claim was made against D2. Third, no
                    police report was made in China that the Tianjin factories were wrongfully taken
                    by Leon Zhao or D2 as Wong admitted in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In my view, Falmac’s overall evidence
                    lacked probative value such that Falmac had not discharged its legal and
                    evidential burden of proving that Leon Zhao was D2’s nominee, that the use
                    of a nominee was to disguise D2’s <em>de facto</em>
                    control of the Tianjin subsidiaries, or that D2 had deliberately misled the
                    Commerce Commission of Ninghe to believe that D2 had resigned as legal
                    representative when he knew or must have known that this was
                false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Denial of access to the Tianjin factories and loss of
                effective control of the same</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Falmac’s case was essentially that D2
                    had prevented Choo and Kuan from gaining access to the Tianjin factories (see
                    [6] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> Falmac’s version of events was as
                    follows. On 20 October 2009, Choo and Kuan made a trip to China to visit the
                    Tianjin factories and to obtain the financial records of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries in order to prepare Falmac’s consolidated financial
                        statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Choo and Kuan first visited the Falmac Textile
                    factory but were denied access by the security guard at the
                        entrance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Having no choice but to leave, Choo
                    and Kuan then proceeded to visit the nearby Falmac Machinery factory, whereupon
                    they were attended by the factory’s then General Manager, Zhang, who
                    allowed Choo and Kuan into the factory but he later instructed them to leave
                    after receiving a telephone call from D2 who directed Zhang to ask them to leave
                        immediately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    D2 rejected Falmac’s version of
                    events. D2 contended that he did not prevent or exclude Falmac’s Choo or
                    Kuan from the Tianjin factories. D2 also challenged the sufficiency and
                    reliability of the evidence of Falmac’s witnesses, in particular
                    Zhang’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Dealing first with the Falmac Textile
                    factory, I was of the view that Falmac had not made out its claim. On the
                    evidence of Falmac’s own witnesses, there was nothing to link the events
                    of 20 October 2009 at the Falmac Textile factory to D2. Rather, the evidence
                    suggested that at the time of the visit, the factory had been locked up by a
                    creditor bank after Falmac Textile defaulted on a loan. I refer to the minutes
                    of the meeting held by Falmac’s new board of directors on 14 December 2009
                    wherein Choo informed the new board as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Chairman [<em>ie</em>, Choo] then proposed to the
                        Board to rationalise the textile businesses which would include the disposal
                        of the continuous loss-making business activities in the subsidiaries in
                        China. He informed that both the PRC subsidiaries have also defaulted on
                        their loans with their existing financiers, namely Avenue Asia Mauritius Ltd
                        (in the case of Tianjin Falmac Machinery Company Limited); and the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    To clarify, Avenue Asia Mauritius Ltd had
                    obtained judgment against Falmac Machinery in June 2009, and D2 had informed the
                    company secretary of this judgment on 21 and 26 July 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To the best of the Board’s knowledge, the Tianjin Subsidiaries had
                        incurred significant amount of debts. Avenue Asia Mauritius Limited has
                        obtained a judgment on Falmac Machinery (Tianjin) Ltd with respect to an
                        outstanding debt of approximately RMB12.1 million as at 31 December 2008 and
                        had begun to sell some of the assets of Falmac Machinery (Tianjin) Ltd
                        including, <em>inter alia</em>, the two staff

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    While the evidence was unclear as to the
                    exact date of the foreclosure, this must have been soon after 31 December
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> As such, it was likely that Falmac’s
                    alleged loss of control of the Falmac Textile factory was due to the
                    Agricultural Bank of China’s seizure of the property, rather than
                    D2’s actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    As for the Falmac Machinery factory, there
                    was conflicting evidence on whether Choo and Kuan were denied access to the
                    Falmac Machinery factory on D2’s instructions. Zhang gave evidence that D2
                    had telephoned him soon after Choo and Kuan had entered the factory, instructing
                    him to ask them to leave immediately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> According to Zhang, because of this, he
                    was fired by D2 the next day because he allowed Choo and Kuan to enter the
                        factory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, D2 flatly denied
                    these allegations at trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> D2
                    explained that Zhang was dismissed on the ground of conflict of interest
                    involving his wife’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    D2 argued that Zhang was not an independent
                    witness because he was being paid by Falmac to give evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> After Zhang ceased to work for
                    Tianjin Machinery, Falmac employed Zhang as a “representative for
                    China” from late October 2009 to August 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>
                    Apparently, Zhang’s job was to assist with Falmac’s lawsuits in

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, I’m here to testify.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So I suggest to you that your evidence here today
                            is unreliable and it’s not to be believed because you have been
                            paid to lie?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I disagree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">While I would not go so far as to conclude that Zhang’s
                    evidence was entirely fabricated, it was nevertheless unsafe to rely solely on
                    his evidence that it was D2 who had denied Choo and Kuan access to the Falmac
                    Machinery factory. The need to exercise caution stems from my observation that
                    despite the incident, Falmac did not protest at any time after the visit. The
                    incident was not given any prominence and significance until Falmac amended its
                    pleadings on 8 September 2010. Furthermore, now that the reverse takeover had
                    failed, the tendency to point the finger of blame at others is conceivable. In
                    any case, the incident at the Falmac Machinery factory is now a secondary issue
                    as the crux of Falmac’s case on the Tianjin subsidiaries seems to be the s
                    160 complaint - that D2 had caused Falmac’s
                    shareholding in the Tianjin subsidiaries to be transferred to a third party
                    without the approval of shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Before I move on to deal with the s 160
                    complaint, there is the matter of PYC’s evidence. PYC was Falmac’s
                    witness. He was called to testify that D2 was still in control of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries as late as 14 June 2011 (see [92 (4)] above). PYC was at a Shanghai
                    trade exhibition on 14 June 2011 and he met D2 there. He testified that the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries were participants and had set up a booth at the trade
                    exhibition. PYC was introduced to D2 by one Wu Qin Piao who referred to D2 as
                    the “boss” of the Tianjin subsidiaries. Falmac also relied on
                    D2’s name that was handwritten on the back of the business card of the
                    General Manager of the Tianjin subsidiaries. PYC got the card from his customer
                    who enquired of the General Manager as to the owner of the Tianjin subsidiaries
                    and he wrote down D2’s name on the back of his name card. D2 has refuted
                    PYC’s evidence in his second Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief. First, he
                    denies “any involvement or interest whatsoever, whether as shareholder or
                    director or legal representative or employee, in Falmac Machinery (Tianjin) Ltd
                    and/or Falmac Textile (Tianjin) Co Ltd.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Second, he denies meeting or talking to
                        PYC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> He said that he was at the
                    exhibition to meet his former colleagues who had earlier told him that they
                    would be in Shanghai for the exhibition. In my view, PYC’s evidence is
                    hearsay and has no evidential value. Even if PYC’s evidence is admissible,
                    it is not relevant since it is not Falmac’s pleaded case that D2 has an
                    interest in Sino Vision and controlled the Tianjin subsidiaries through Leon
                    Zhao and Sino Vision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    There is another related plea in the form of
                    a general assertion in paragraph 4(8) of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2)
                    that D2 was under a duty to manage and deal with Falmac’s property in a
                    trustee-like manner. It was stated that the loss of effective control of the
                    Tianjin factories was due to D2’s breach of trust by reason of the
                    unlawful appointment of Leon Zhao as legal representative. I make two points.
                    First, this plea is premised on the appointment of Leon Zhao being unlawful. I
                    have already explained that Falmac has not established this assertion (see [99]
                    above). Second, the general assertion in paragraph 4(8) of the Statement of
                    Claim (Amendment No 2) is simply unhelpful. A legal representative supposedly
                    holds the company seals of the subsidiary, which owns the property (the Tianjin
                    factories in this case). A holding company like Falmac is not the owner of the
                    subsidiary’s assets. That being the law, no duty of trusteeship is
                    applicable here (see <em>Townsing</em> at
                [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The s 160 complaint</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Under s 160 of the Companies Act, the
                    directors of a company are prohibited from carrying into effect any proposals
                    for disposing of the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s
                    undertaking or property unless those proposals have been approved by the company
                    in general meeting. The issue here was whether the former board (D2 included)
                    acted in breach of this provision in passing the board resolution to transfer
                    the equity in the Tianjin subsidiaries to Sino Vision and signing the Equity
                    Agreements without any shareholders’ approval. In the present action,
                    Falmac is not disavowing the equity transfer to Sino Vision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In the first place, it is worth noting that
                    far from D2 acting purely of his own volition, the divestment of the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries appears to have originated from Wong and Choo in relation to plans
                    for the reverse takeover. In March 2009, before the new board had assumed its
                    responsibilities, Wong, Choo and D2 were working towards the disposal of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries for a nominal sum of S$1 (see [40] above). I also refer to
                    the various e-mails in [31] to [35] above. This activity was consistent with the
                    reverse takeover plan whereby Falmac was to be restructured into a shell
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    One of the main points of contention
                    regarding this issue was the admissibility and authenticity of documents known
                    as “Basic Information of Foreign Investment Enterprise”
                    (“the Basic Information documents”) lodged with the Commercial
                    &amp; Industrial Bureau of Tianjin, China (“the Tianjin Commercial
                    Bureau”). Falmac introduced these documents to show that Sino Vision had
                    become the registered shareholder of the Tianjin subsidiaries. The Basic
                    Information documents, being copies of the originals, constituted secondary
                    evidence and thus would only be admissible in evidence if falling within one of
                    the exceptions in s 67(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the
                    EA”). Mr Quek submitted that the exception for public documents in s
                    67(1)(e) of the EA applied. The Basic Information documents were thus admissible
                    under s 67(4) of the EA because they had been certified as true copies, as
                    evidenced by the red seal of the Tianjin Commercial Bureau on the documents. On
                    the other hand, Mr Singh submitted that the Basic Information documents were not
                    certified copies within the meaning of s 78 of the EA, as there was neither a
                    certification at the foot of the documents that they were true copies of the
                    originals nor a date on the seal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    I agreed with Mr Singh that the Basic
                    Information documents could not be produced as proof of the truth of the
                    contents. Under s 64 read with s 66 of the EA, the general rule is that
                    documents must be proved by primary evidence, <em>ie</em>,
                    the document itself must be produced for the inspection of the court. The Basic
                    Information documents did not constitute primary evidence and thus had to fall
                    within the exceptions in s 67 of the EA, the “public document”
                    exception in s 67(1)(e) being the most relevant exception. The Basic Information
                    documents were public documents within the meaning of s 76 of the EA as they
                    were records of public officers in a foreign country. Moreover, it appeared that
                    they were documents intended for public reference (see <em>Lim
                        Weipin and another v Lim Boh Chuan and others</em> [2010] 3 SLR 423 at
                    [44]). However, as for the means of proof of such documents, the applicable
                    provision is s 80(g) of the EA, rather than s 78. Section 80(g) of the EA
                    provides that public documents in a foreign country may be proved in the
                    following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... by the original or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof,
                        with a certificate under the seal of a notary public or of a consular
                        officer of Singapore that the copy is duly certified by the officer having
                        the legal custody of the original and upon proof of the character of the
                        document according to the law of the foreign country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In this case, the Basic Information
                    documents did not contain such a certification under the seal of a notary public
                    or consular officer of Singapore and were thus not proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Be that as it may, Falmac’s Chinese
                    lawyer from Tianjin Yidao Law Firm, Mr Xu Bo (“Mr Xu”), testified
                    that he had attended at the Tianjin Commercial Bureau to inspect the original
                    documents lodged there. Mr Xu is permitted to give an eye-witness account of
                    what he saw (see s 65 (e) of the EA), but not secondary evidence as to the truth
                    of the contents of the documents he inspected. For example, he is able to
                    testify that he saw the name Sino Vision, that he saw the shares registered in
                    the name of Sino Vision and that he saw the date 18 August 2011. (I accept the
                    evidence that Sino Vision is the translation in English of the name of the
                    company in Chinese.) However, he was not in a position to testify as to the
                    truth of what he had seen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Returning to the substantive complaint, I
                    find that Falmac has not proven that D2 was in breach of s 160 of the Companies
                    Act or in breach of fiduciary duty. I accept D2’s evidence that the Equity
                    Agreements between Falmac and Sino Vision were conditional contracts. There were
                    two separate Equity Agreements: one for each Tianjin subsidiary, although they
                    were otherwise identical. Article 7 in both Equity Agreements provided as
                    follows:</p>

                            agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The effect of Article 7, in particular
                    sub-clauses (1) and (2), was that the Equity Agreements were conditional on the
                    approval of Falmac’s shareholders, amongst other things. The terms of the
                    Equity Agreements indicate the parties’ understanding that the Equity
                    Agreements were a provisional arrangement, pending the actual validation of the
                    transfer by the relevant authorities and corporate organs of the parties
                    involved. Article 7(1) provides a time frame of 12 months for the completion of
                    “formalities to effect the transfer of the equity”. Article 7(2)
                    gives some examples of such necessary formalities, <em>including
                        but not limited to</em> a board resolution consenting to the transfer
                    and completing the registration of changes in Falmac’s shareholding, etc.
                    Logically speaking, such formalities would also include shareholder approval of
                    the equity transfer as required by law, and this was confirmed by D2 in the
                    witness stand. In other words, the Equity Agreements were expressed to take
                    effect after formal approvals (including shareholders’ approval) have been
                    obtained. This position was confirmed by D2’s testimony during the
                        trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> This being the case, the
                    Equity Agreements being conditional contracts did not evidence an effective
                    disposal of the Tianjin subsidiaries by D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I now come to Mr Xu’s eye-witness
                    testimony. He saw the date 18 August 2011 and the name of Sino Vision in
                    Chinese. Assuming for the sake of argument that this date, 18 August 2011, was
                    the registration of the shares, this would have been more than two years after
                    the Equity Agreements were signed on 30 July 2009. It was envisaged in the
                    Equity Agreements that the formalities would be attended to and completed within
                    one year failing which the Equity Agreements would come to an end. Mr Singh
                    surmised that since the date 18 August 2011 exceeds the stipulated period of one
                    year, the only explanation is that the Equity Agreements were extended with the
                    involvement of the new board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I noted that the new board passed a
                    resolution to divest the Tianjin subsidiaries on 14 December 2009 and the
                    divestment was subject to shareholders’ approval. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> Despite claiming to have
                    lost effective control of the Tianjin subsidiaries with the appointment of Leon
                    Zhao, and the subsequent exclusion of Choo and Kuan from entering to the Tianjin
                    factories, Falmac still treated the Tianjin subsidiaries as company assets. It
                    went ahead with the divestment of the loss-making Tianjin subsidiaries, which
                    was an integral part of the reverse takeover plan. Falmac signed a memorandum of
                    understanding with Unitex on 21 May 2010 and a sale and purchase agreement with
                    Unitex on 11 July 2011 (“the Unitex SPA”). Under the Unitex SPA,
                    the aggregate sale consideration for 100% equity interest in the Tianjin
                    subsidiaries was S$2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The
                    Unitex SPA was conditional upon: (a) shareholders’ approval; (b)
                    successful acquisition of the entire issued share capital of CNMC; and (c)
                    resumption of trading of Falmac’s shares on Catalist. Under the Unitex
                    SPA, the effective date of the transfer of the entire equity interest in the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries from Falmac to Unitex was 11 July 2011 even though the
                    actual transfer had not taken place. As Falmac did not have any business other
                    than the Tianjin subsidiaries, it became a shell company which would be
                    de-listed if it remained without any viable business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    After executing the Unitex SPA, the reverse
                    takeover was eventually derailed. As it turned out, there were delays in
                    resumption of trading. Falmac was de-listed on 22 August 2011 for the reason
                    that Falmac had difficulties persuading SGX-ST to accept its resumption proposal
                    submitted on 28 April 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Despite admitting under oath on 18 July 2011
                    that the de-listing had to do with Falmac’s resumption proposal that
                    involved CNMC, Wong (as Falmac’s Managing Director) disingenuously
                    announced in the company’s Notification of Delisting Date sometime after
                    the 22 August 2011 that the company had become a shell company with no business
                    due to the inability of the company to access the Tianjin factories as a result
                    of the change of legal representative by D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Furthermore, there was no issue of
                    non-disclosure of the Equity Agreements to the new board in this case. The
                    Equity Agreements were approved by the former board in July 2009. The new board
                    took over on 5 October 2009. By the time the new board was appointed on 5
                    October 2009, D2 had himself been removed on the same date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Notably, it is not Falmac’s case that
                    the resolution passed by the former board in July 2009 was fraudulent or
                    otherwise invalid. Neither is it Falmac’s case that there was a causal
                    link between the unauthorised appointment of the legal representative argument
                    and the s 160 complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Anyhow, for the sake of argument, even if
                    the appointment of Leon Zhao was misguided or negligent, this would not expose
                    D2 to a charge of breach of fiduciary duty. As stated above, the various
                    obligations of a fiduciary merely reflect different aspects of the core duty of
                    loyalty. A breach of fiduciary obligation connotes disloyalty and beyond mere
                    neglect. In any case, the court usually does not inquire into the merits of a
                    management decision honestly arrived at (see [68] above). In this case, there
                    were ostensibly management reasons for the former board to approve the Equity
                    Agreements to avoid ligation, and seeing that Sino Vision would then take over
                    and be responsible for the liabilities of the Tianjin subsidiaries. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the unauthorised legal representative argument and the
                s 160 complaint </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Having regard to the matters discussed
                    above, the overall conclusion reached in this Judgment is that Falmac has not
                    proven its case against D2 under these two heads of complaints
                        - the unauthorised legal representative argument and the
                    s 160 complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The secondary claims against D2 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    I now come to other breaches of fiduciary
                    duty alleged in respect of D2. I have referred to these complains as secondary
                    claims (see [70] above). I have also explained in [16] that the declaratory
                    relief that Falmac is seeking is superfluous. Although the action continued
                    against D2, the secondary claims were alleged against <em>all</em> the directors. In my view, it is not enough to look at what
                    happened in the company and to simply say that as all the directors are to be
                    blamed D2 must therefore be in breach of directors’ duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-compliance with rules on AGM and financial statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Falmac alleged various breaches of the rules
                    relating to the convening of an AGM and the presentation of financial
                    statements, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_1"></a>(1)     Failure to convene Falmac’s
                        AGM for the year ending 31 December 2008 by the statutory
                    deadline;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_2"></a>(2)     Failure
                        to present the financial statements to Falmac’s shareholders as
                        required under s 201(1) of the Companies Act, Rule 707(1) of the Listing
                        Rules and article 152 of the Articles of Association of
                    Falmac;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_3"></a>(3)     Failure to
                        comply with s 201(3A) of the Companies Act in failing to prepare the
                        financial statements of Falmac in accordance with the Accounting
                        Standards;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_4"></a>(4)     Failure to present the financial statements at an AGM accompanied by a
                        director’s statement as required by s 201(15) of the Companies
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The failure to convene the AGM by the
                    statutory deadline did not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty on the part
                    of D2. Section 175(1) of the Companies Act provides that an AGM of a company
                    must be held once every calendar year and not more than 15 months after the last
                    AGM. Rule 707(1) of the Listing Rules further provides that the AGM must be held
                    within four months of the end of the company’s financial year. In this
                    case, the deadline for the AGM for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 30 April
                    2009. The Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”)
                    and SGX-ST granted a two-month extension (<em>ie</em>,
                    until 30 June 2009) for the AGM to be held, which was not complied with.
                    Subsequently, SGX-ST (but not ACRA) granted a further extension until 31 July
                    2009, which was also not met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    However, Falmac’s AGM was delayed due
                    to events not entirely within D2’s control. At the start of 2009, Falmac
                    was in financial difficulty and faced problems in performing its accounting and
                    finance functions following the resignation of Falmac’s financial
                    controller and her assistant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> Choo and BCS then engaged Bizcorp to take
                    over Falmac’s accounts in February 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, the further extension was requested
                    due to a breakdown of Falmac’s hard disk.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> According
                    to D2’s evidence, the 31 July 2009 deadline was also not met because he
                    was not able to verify the financial statements prepared by Bizcorp without the
                    source documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that Falmac’s
                    accounting records, papers and documents were stored in a property owned by CNMC
                    “to facilitate due diligence for the purpose of RTO [reverse takeover]
                        consideration.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> To this end, given that the
                    accounting records and other papers were not readily available to D2 without
                    some cooperation from Choo, and under s 199 of the Companies Act, a director is
                    entitled to documents, D2’s insistence on verification with the source
                    documents was an approach he was entitled to take and adopt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In any case, the AGM to approve
                    Falmac’s 2008 financial statements was eventually held on 14 December
                        2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>,
                    without any monetary loss to Falmac<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> for missing the deadline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In relation to the alleged breaches of duty
                    relating to the financial statements of Falmac, one preliminary point arises.
                    Falmac’s pleadings which asserted breaches of ss 201(1), 201(3A) and
                    201(15) were flawed. Section 201(1) of the Companies Act provides that the
                    directors shall lay before the company at its AGM a profit and loss account for
                    the relevant period. However, s 201(3A) provides that directors of a <em>holding company</em> must ensure that consolidated accounts
                    and a balance sheet complying with the requirements of the Accounting Standards
                    are laid out before the company at its AGM, and expressly excludes the need to
                    comply with s 201(1). It is thus impossible to be in breach of both s 201(1) and
                    s 201(3A) at the same time. Since Falmac appears to fall within the definition
                    of a holding company in s 5 of the Companies Act, only s 201(3A) and s 201(15)
                    remain to be considered. Section 201(15) of the Companies Act provides that
                    every balance sheet and profit and loss account laid before a company in general
                    meeting shall be accompanied by a statement signed by two
                directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    While directors have a statutory duty to
                    ensure that the company’s accounts are properly prepared, a breach of the
                    latter does not automatically result in a breach of fiduciary duty (see [67]
                    above). The essential question to be considered is whether D2 acted honestly and
                    with the same degree of care and skill as a reasonable director in his position.
                    With regards to s 201(3A) of the Companies Act, Falmac pleaded that D2 had not
                    given available information on the Falmac’s subsidiaries to the auditors
                    for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements. However,
                    Falmac failed to show that D2 in fact held back such information from the
                    auditors, and also did not specify any breach of the Accounting Standards. As
                    for s 201(15), <em>viz</em>, the requirement to present a
                    company’s financial statements accompanied by a directors’ statement
                    at an AGM, D2 did not act unreasonably or in breach of his fiduciary duties for
                    the same reasons above. There were significant difficulties in preparing
                    Falmac’s accounts at the relevant time, such as the departure of financial
                    personnel, the delegation of accounting functions to Bizcorp as well as the
                    breakdown of Falmac’s hard disk. I also accepted D2’s evidence that
                    he and the former board had refrained from signing the financial statements
                    prepared by the auditors until they had ascertained for themselves the veracity
                    of the financial statements. In any case, it was again not disputed that Falmac
                    did not suffer any monetary loss as a result of the delay in presenting its
                        accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-compliance with directorship requirements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Falmac alleged that D2 was in breach of his
                    fiduciary duties by failing to ensure that Falmac complied with the directorship
                    requirements in the Listing Rules. The three independent directors on the former
                    board had resigned on 30 July 2009, leaving D2 and Fei on Falmac’s board
                    of directors until the new board took over on 5 October 2009. In particular,
                    Falmac alleged the following breaches of the Listing Rules on the part of
                    D2:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_1"></a>(1)     Failure to provide reasons for the
                        cessation of David Lu and Wei Ying as directors of Falmac on 30 July
                        2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_2"></a>(2)     Failure
                        to make the necessary announcement despite SGX-ST query on 31 July
                        2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_3"></a>(3)     Failure
                        to appoint independent directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_4"></a>(4)     Failure to appoint at least one independent director
                        resident in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_5"></a>(5)     Failure to meet the minimum number (not less than three)
                        required for an audit committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    In addition, Falmac also alleged that D2 had
                    breached his fiduciary duty by allowing his employment pass to expire without
                    renewal and had instead updated ACRA with his foreign address, thereby causing
                    Falmac to be in breach of the legal requirement for Falmac to have a resident
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The Listing Rules prescribe certain
                    procedures and requirements to be met regarding directors in a listed company.
                    Under Rule 720 read with Rule 210(5)(c) and Rule 221 of the Listing Rules, the
                    company’s board must have at least two independent non-executive directors
                    resident in Singapore. Rule 704(8) of the Listing Rules provides that in the
                    event of any resignation that renders the audit committee unable to meet the
                    minimum requirements of three directors, the company must endeavour to fill the
                    vacancy within two months, but in any case not later than three months. Further,
                    Rule 704(7) read with Appendix 7.4.2 of the Listing Rules provides that any
                    cessation of service of key persons such as directors must be announced together
                    with detailed reasons for the cessation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    While it was clear that there was
                    non-compliance with the Listing Rules with regard to the minimum number of
                    resident and independent directors of Falmac, this did not automatically result
                    in a breach of D2’s fiduciary duty as a director. This complaint did not
                    take off as Falmac did not (although it was required to) identify the specific
                    fiduciary obligation of which D2 is alleged to have been in
                breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    As for the requirements for the audit
                    committee and independent directors of Falmac under Rule 704(8) of the Listing
                    Rules, it was clear that in early 2009, Choo was pushing for the independent
                    directors to resign so that he and two others could take over. In Choo’s
                    earlier e-mail to D2 dated 20 January 2009, D2 was asked to get the three
                    independent directors to resign (see [31] above). His second e-mail
                        reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Charlie,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This email is to inform you that I have (sic) going to send the Attached
                        Forms to the 3 new director to fill up in preparation for the resignation of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 3 new directors are myself, KK Teo and Kuan Cheng Tuck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    On 23 January 2009, the resignation of the
                    three independent directors was again raised by Choo. He informed D2 that the
                    resignation letter should be undated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> There were further communications on
                    the resignation of the independent directors. Apparently the undated resignation
                    letters were submitted to the company secretary but not acted upon. It appears
                    from D2’s e-mail to the company secretary that the resignations were being
                    held up until the 2008 accounts were completed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Eventually, the three independent directors
                    decided to proceed with the resignations on 30 July 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> D2 could hardly retain
                    them as directors against their will and Falmac was in no financial position to
                    appoint new directors. Regarding the provision of reasons for cessation of
                    service of directors under Rule 704(7) of the Listing Rules, it was the three
                    independent directors themselves who had cited “personal reasons”
                    for their resignations and refused to provide any further details.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> Further, it was the
                    company secretary who omitted to record “personal reasons” in the
                    announcement made to the SGX-ST.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    As for two independent directors resident in
                    Singapore pursuant to Rule 720 read with Rule 210(5)(c) and Rule 221 of the
                    Listing Rules, again, Falmac had not identified the fiduciary obligation of
                    which he is alleged to have been in breach. In any case, D2 had made
                    arrangements to renew his employment pass.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> However, according to D2, the Ministry
                    of Manpower refused to renew D2’s employment pass due to Falmac’s
                    poor track record in paying their CPF contributions for its
                        employees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> It was also unclear
                    how a breach of fiduciary duty was made out on the basis that D2 had updated his
                    address to a foreign address. Rather, the true nature of Falmac’s
                    complaint appeared to be that D2 breached his fiduciary duty by failing to
                    appoint another local director before his own status as a resident director
                    lapsed. This complaint was unsustainable because there were plans to sign in the
                    new board as directors since early 2009, which would have fulfilled the
                    requirements for a resident director, although there were setbacks due to
                    disagreements between the former board and the new board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    In any case, Falmac did not plead any
                    incidental financial loss or consequences for the above breaches of directorship
                    requirements, which have already been rectified with the appointment of the new
                    board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-disclosure of the judgment against Falmac Machinery to
                SGX-ST</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Falmac’s complaint was that D2 failed
                    to disclose to the SGX-ST the fact that a judgment for RMB12.1m in the Chinese
                    courts had been obtained in June 2009 against Falmac Machinery by a creditor,
                    Avenue Asia Mauritius Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> On 21 July 2009, D2
                    had sent the original judgment to the company secretary’s assistant,
                    Lynette Tan, who then asked D2 for an official translation of the judgment in
                    the English language.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span>
                    D2 replied on 26 July 2009, providing the main points of the judgment translated
                    into English and explaining that Falmac could not afford to obtain an official
                    translation of the judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> Eventually, D2 wrote to SGX-ST itself
                    in an e-mail dated 15 August 2009 mentioning the court order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> At that time, Falmac was
                    already in financial difficulty and could not afford to have the Chinese
                    judgment translated officially. In these circumstances, D2 did what he could to
                    disclose the Chinese judgment. There is no justification for treating D2’s
                    actions as demonstrating non-disclosure or a failure to act with reasonable
                    diligence. In any event, Falmac again did not plead any financial consequences
                    or loss in respect of this non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bih Li &amp; Lee resolution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Falmac’s complaint here was that D2,
                    together with Fei, had passed a directors’ resolution appointing Bih Li
                    &amp; Lee to act for Falmac without Falmac’s consent or approval. This
                    resolution was passed on 4 September 2009 for the purposes of applying for an
                    injunction restraining BCS and the company secretary from convening an
                        EOGM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> With respect, this claim was a
                    non-starter. As of 4 September 2009, Falmac’s board of directors consisted
                    of only D2 and Fei, both of whom signed the above resolution. Indeed, in
                    cross-examination, Wong accepted that Bih Li &amp; Lee were duly appointed to
                    act with the consent and approval of Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other matters: Falmac’s claim of RMB 47m for the Tianjin
                subsidiaries </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Having regard to the conclusions reached in
                    this judgment, Falmac’s claim for damages falls on the wayside. However,
                    for the sake of completeness, I propose to comment on the claim for damages
                    mainly from the perspective of causation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    In relation to the question of what remedy
                    is available in respect of a breach of fiduciary duty, in claiming common law
                    damages, Falmac has to prove that the breach of the particular fiduciary
                    obligation caused the loss alleged. In other words, there must be a causal link
                    between the relevant wrong and the relevant loss, if proved. In my view, the
                    casual link is missing in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Besides, proof of loss is difficult.
                    According to D2, the debt-for-share transaction involved the discharge of debts
                    owed by the Tianjin subsidiaries and acquired by Sino Vision as well as the
                    discharge of Falmac’s indebtedness to the Tianjin subsidiaries.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> In addition, under the
                    Equity Agreements, Sino Vision assumed responsibility for the remaining debts
                    owed by the Tianjin subsidiaries to other creditors. In other words, the
                    debt-for-share transaction would have provided relief to the balance sheet of
                    the Tianjin subsidiaries and in turn that of Falmac’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    With regards to the net asset value of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries, the aggregate figure of RMB 47m was derived from the
                    audited financial statements of the Tianjin subsidiaries for the year ended 31
                    December 2008 (“the 2008 Tianjin financial statements”). In the
                    course of answering counsel’s question on legal steps taken to regain
                    control of the Tianjin subsidiaries, Wong conceded that the new board could not
                    ascertain whether the aggregate figure of RMB 47m as shown in accounts of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries was true or false.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> He also confirmed that Falmac’s auditors
                    in Singapore had disclaimed the accuracy of the 2008 Tianjin financial
                        statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Whilst the 2008 Tianjin financial statements
                    showed that the net asset or net equity of Falmac Textile was as RMB 22,929,287
                    and that of Falmac Machinery as RMB 24,506,075,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> Falmac’s 2008 consolidated
                    financial statements, which were based on the 2008 Tianjin financial statements,
                    showed the value of the net assets of the Tianjin subsidiaries at only
                        S$28,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> That is not the
                    end of the discrepancy. D2 pointed out that Falmac’s 2008 consolidated
                    financial statements contained a disclaimer regarding the financial statements
                    of the Tianjin subsidiaries<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> and that the Singapore auditors
                    responsible for Falmac’s 2008 consolidated financial statements had
                    highlighted to him certain issues that were not considered by the Chinese
                    auditors in the 2008 Tianjin financial statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> In other words, the
                    figures in the 2008 Tianjin financial statements as well as Falmac’s
                    consolidated financial statements have not been verified and cannot be safely
                    relied upon as evidence of the value of the Tianjin subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Moreover, Wong in cross-examination accepted
                    that the figure of RMB 47m in the 2008 Tianjin financial statements would not
                    have included the judgment debt of RMB 12.1m in favour of Avenue Asia Mauritius
                    Ltd or the RMB 19.2 m owed to the Agriculture Bank of China, and that the value
                    of the assets was practically zero according to Falmac’s Singapore
                        auditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> However, Kuan disagreed,
                    maintaining that RMB 47m took into account the Tianjin subsidiaries’
                    indebtedness to two creditors. In short, Falmac’s own witnesses provided
                    contradictory evidence on the same matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The fallback position is that value of the
                    Tianjin subsidiaries must be at least RMB 11m seeing that the Equity Agreements
                    provided for a total consideration of approximately RMB 11m for Falmac’s
                    shareholding in the Tianjin subsidiaries. However, it is not clear how RMB 11m
                    would prove the loss in value of the Tianjin subsidiaries when the Equity
                    Agreements were each structured as a debt-for-share transaction and the
                    responsibility for the remaining debts owed to other creditors was assumed by
                    Sino Vision.</p>

                    Contract was negotiated and approved by the remuneration committee, as
                    represented by Fei, David Lu, and Lu Jing (another independent director of
                    Falmac at that time), at a meeting in December 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> As such,
                    the former board had been fully apprised of the terms of his employment, as
                    evidenced by various documents such as Falmac’s annual reports and
                    financial statements covering the relevant periods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Board approval of the Employment Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Under Falmac’s Articles of
                    Association, the board of directors had the power to determine the remuneration
                    of a director in respect of his service as employee, without the need for
                    approval of Falmac’s members in general meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> In addition, the board of
                    directors also had the power to approve travel expenses and other fees for an
                    executive director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> However, in the present
                    case, the Employment Contract was signed on behalf of Falmac by an individual
                    independent director, David Lu. There was no documented evidence in the form of
                    board resolution approving D2’s Employment Contract or authorising David
                    Lu to sign the Employment Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The general principle of company law is that
                    the directors must act collectively through resolutions at proper board
                    meetings, unless specifically authorised to act individually (see <em>SAL Industrial Leasing Ltd v Hydtrolmech Automation Services Pte
                        Ltd and others</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 676 at [42]; <em>Agency Law</em> (Roger Billins) (Longman, 1993) at [B1.28]). However,
                    there is no general requirement that the remuneration of a normal employee must
                    be formally approved by the board of directors (see <em>Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) v Ho Kang Peng and
                        another</em> [2013] SGHC 34 at [29]). Where all the directors
                    informally assent to an agreement which is signed by one of the directors on
                    behalf of the company, such assent is as binding as a board resolution and the
                    agreement will be binding on the company (see <em>SAL Industrial
                        Leasing Ltd v Lin Hwee Guan</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 31 at [27]). In other
                    words, where the board of directors informally acquiesces to an individual
                    director’s acceptance of a contract on behalf of the company, this is
                    sufficient to vest authority in that director (see <em>Kwee Seng
                        Chio Peter v Biogenics Sdn Bhd</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 482
                        (“<em>Kwee Seng Chio</em>”) at
                    [27]-[29]). As such, in order for D2’s counterclaim to succeed, it had to
                    be shown that Falmac’s board had informally assented to: (1) the terms of
                    D2’s Employment Contract; and (2) David Lu’s acceptance of the
                    Employment Contract on behalf of Falmac.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    I am satisfied that the evidence in this
                    case is sufficient to bear out D2’s claim based on the Employment
                    Contract. I accept D2’s evidence that the terms of his Employment Contract
                    was negotiated and agreed upon by Falmac’s then board of directors, and
                    also that David Lu had signed the Employment Contract with the assent of the
                    rest of the directors. This was what D2 said in his
                        cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Despite the absence of any minutes of board
                    meetings or corroborating testimony, D2’s version of events was credible
                    in light of the contemporaneous documentary evidence. First of all,
                    Falmac’s annual reports from 2005 to 2007 showed D2’s remuneration
                    at above S$250,000 for each respective year,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> indicating that Falmac’s
                    board of directors must have agreed on D2’s salary of S$280,000 as
                    provided for in the Employment Contract. A board resolution on D2’s
                    appointment serves as documentary evidence approving such an agreement; in its
                    absence, other forms of documentary evidence, such as the annual reports, may be
                    relied upon. In <em>Auston International Group Ltd and another v
                        Ng Swee Hua</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 628 (“<em>Auston International</em>”), the Court of Appeal held that the
                    respondent was the owner of certain convertible bonds on the basis of the
                    company’s annual accounts, even though the company had not issued the
                    physical bond certificates. The reasoning in <em>Auston
                        International</em> was as follows (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    Counsel for the appellants has not produced any
                            statutory or case authority to show that because the bond certificates
                            had not been issued, Austo<em>n’s acknowledgement
                                in its books that the</em> respondent was the owner of the
                            Convertible Bonds could not provide a legal basis upon which the
                            respondent could convert them into the Conversion Shares. We agree with
                            the Judge that the bond <em>c</em>ertificates in
                            the <em>present c</em>ase were only <em>documentar</em>y evidence of the respondent’s
                            ownership of the bonds. The failure of the appellants to procure the
                            issue of the certificates could not be a ground for depriving the
                            respondent ownership of the Convertible Bonds.[emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    In <em>Greene King plc v
                        Harlow District Council</em> [2004] 1 WLR 2339, Goldring J upheld a
                    lower court’s decision that the appellant company was a “proprietor
                    of a food business” for the purpose of food safety regulations based
                    primarily on statements made in the appellant’s annual
                report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Similarly, Falmac’s annual reports can
                    be said to have acknowledged D2’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer
                    on the terms of the Employment Contract. The annual reports stated D2’s
                    designation as Chief Executive Officer and showed his salary as above S$250,000.
                    The annual reports contained a directors’ statement that the accompanying
                    financial statements in the reports gave a “true and fair view of the
                    state of affairs” of Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> Moreover, as the annual reports
                    stated that the function of the remuneration committee was to review the
                    remuneration packages of each executive director and executive officers of
                    Falmac, in the ordinarily course of things, the remuneration committee would
                    have reviewed and consented to the terms of D2’s appointment on the terms
                    in the Employment Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    However, there were certain ostensible
                    inconsistencies in the annual reports that needed to be clarified. The 2005
                    annual report contained the following statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the Company has incurred a loss for the year ended 31 December 2005,
                        only the Executive Director, Mr Charlie Cheng Ji Lai <em>received remuneration of not more than $300,000</em>. No other
                        remuneration in the form of salary were paid or declared to the other
                        directors, namely, Mr Fei Xue Jun, Mr David Lu Hai Ge, Ms Lu Jing and Ms Yu
                        Wei Ying in the financial year ended 31 December 2005. A breakdown, showing
                        the level and mix of each individual director’s remuneration <em>paid or payable</em> for the financial year ended 31
                        December 2005 is as follows: [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Similar statements were also found in the
                    2006 and 2007 annual reports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> This gave rise to two possible
                    interpretations: (1) remuneration of not more than S$300,000 was <em>actually paid</em> to D2; or (2) remuneration of not more
                    than S$300,000 was <em>payable</em>, but unpaid. After
                    examining the annual reports in greater detail, I accepted version (2) as the
                    more accurate interpretation. The notes to the financial statements in the 2005
                    annual report recorded an amount of S$390,000 due to Falmac’s directors,
                    which was stated to be unsecured, interest-free and repayable on
                        demand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span>
                    This amount increased to S$570,000 in the 2006 annual report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> and to S$945,000 in the
                    2007 annual report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span>
                    Falmac’s 2008 annual report showed a sum of S$1,363,000 owing to the
                    directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span>, which was confirmed by
                    the 2009 annual report as the total amount owing to the “former
                        directors”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span>
                    These sums could not have been references to accruals for directors’ fees,
                    as these were recorded separately. Rather, the logical inference was that these
                    sums referred to directors’ salaries that were deferred from 2005
                        onwards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> Given that the only salaried director
                    was D2, the conclusion must be that D2’s remuneration was payable, but not
                    paid to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    I should add at this point that Wong in his
                    oral testimony conceded that the new board was not disputing what is recorded in
                    the accounting records and submitted to the public in the annual
                        reports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The second category of documentary evidence
                    that I considered was Falmac’s 2008 management accounts, also known as
                    statements of account. Falmac’s 2008 annual report, which was only
                    published on 18 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span>, did not reflect D2’s salary for
                    2008. This was because by that time, the new board had taken over Falmac’s
                    affairs and was disputing D2’s salary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> However, Falmac’s statements of
                    account as at 31 December 2008 showed D2’s salary at S$280,000, as well as
                    travelling allowances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span>
                    These statements of account were prepared by Falmac’s finance personnel,
                    one Lim Shwu Peng, and I accepted her evidence that they were verified and
                    prepared in accordance with normal company procedures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Thirdly, correspondence between IRAS and
                    various representatives of Falmac also confirmed D2’s salary as stated in
                    the Employment Contract, and that his salary had not been paid by Falmac.
                    Falmac’s financial controller had written to IRAS in April 2008 confirming
                    D2’s annual salary at S$280,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> In April 2009, Fei, the other
                    executive director on the former board, had also written to IRAS confirming that
                    D2’s salary and directors fees for the financial years 2007 and 2008, as
                    well as any prior outstanding amounts owing to D2, had not been
                        paid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Finally, the evidence adduced in the course
                    of the trial indicated on the whole that Falmac and its staff regarded D2 as its
                    Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director from 2004 to 2009. For example,
                    an “Employee Resignation Agreement”, dealing with the resignation
                    of one of Falmac’s former employees, was signed off by D2 as Chief
                    Executive Officer of Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> Much of the correspondence relied upon
                    by the parties in the course of the trial was also signed off by D2 as Chief
                    Executive Officer, or referred to him in that capacity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> For instance, D2
                    corresponded frequently with SGX-ST regarding Falmac’s compliance
                        matters.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Based on the overall evidence before me, I
                    find that the Employment Contract was valid and had full binding effect on
                    Falmac. Similar to the factual scenarios in <em>Kwee Seng
                        Chio</em>, the reasonable inference from the evidence was that David
                    Lu signed the Employment Contract with the consent and authority of the board,
                    even though there was no formal board resolution authorising him to do so.
                    Consequently, I also dismissed Falmac’s argument that D2 was intended to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The issue regarding D2’s claim for
                    directors’ fees of S$45,000 was whether such fees had been separately
                    approved by Falmac in general meeting. Wong’s concession narrated in [171]
                    above extends to this claim for unpaid director’s fees. Equally, Mr Quek
                    in his Closing Submissions did not dispute and take issue with this claim for
                    S$45,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In Falmac’s 2006 and 2007 annual
                    reports, the range of directors’ fees due to D2 was stated to be 5% of his
                    total remuneration and “subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual
                    General Meeting”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> The 2006 and 2007 annual reports each
                    contained a notice of AGM, and stated that all shareholders would receive the
                    annual report and be given the opportunity to air their views at the
                        AGM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> This was in line with the statutory
                    requirement in s 201(1) of the Companies Act that the directors lay the accounts
                    before the company at the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    In the present case, there is no suggestion
                    at all that the AGMs called for the periods in question did not take place.
                    Relying on s 116 (f) of EA that the common course of business has been followed,
                    the court is permitted to presume that resolutions authorising the directors to
                    receive remuneration as in director’s fees, had been passed in the general
                    meetings of the company. Directors’ fees for the years 2006 to 2007 were
                    in all likelihood approved and carried into effect in the relevant general
                    meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    D2’s director’s fees for the
                    year 2008 were reflected in Falmac’s 2008 statements of account together
                    with the outstanding fees from 2006 and 2007, which came up to a total sum of
                        S$45,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span>
                    The AGM for the 2008 financial year was called by the new board on 14 December
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> Again, in the absence of
                    any evidence to the contrary, the 2008 directors’ fees were likely
                    approved at the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Accordingly, I accept D2’s claim for
                    S$45,000 as proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Severance compensation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Similar to directors’ fees, the issue
                    regarding D2’s severance compensation under clause 14 of the Employment
                    Contract (see [160] above) is whether it had been approved by the company in
                    general meeting. Section 168(1) of the Companies Act prohibits any payment by a
                    company to any director by way of compensation for loss of office as an officer
                    of the company or as consideration for or in connection with his retirement from
                    any such office, unless the particulars of the proposed payment, including the
                    amount thereof, have been disclosed to the members of the company and the
                    proposal has been approved by the company in general meeting. Payment to an
                    executive director as compensation for the loss of his employment was
                    compensation for the loss of office as an officer of the company within the
                    meaning of s 168 of the Companies Act (see <em>Goh Kim Hai Edward
                        v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R)
                    540).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In this case, there was no evidence that
                    D2’s severance compensation was disclosed to or approved by Falmac in
                    general meeting. As D2’s claim could only have arisen after he resigned as
                    Chief Executive Officer in July 2009, this amount also did not appear in any of
                    Falmac’s annual reports. Thus, D2 has not established his claim to
                    severance compensation of S$500,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loan, credit card expenses, and amounts to IRAS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    D2 had provided supporting documents in the
                    form of Falmac’s monthly statements of account ending with the statement
                    of account as at 31 December 2008 for these claims. As the debts were recognised
                    in the accounting records of Falmac, Wong conceded to the claims in his oral
                        evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> Notably, Mr Quek in
                    his Closing Submissions did not take issue with the loan and amounts paid to
                    IRAS. However, he objected to the credit card charges as D2 did not produce
                    credit card statements to show details of the transactions. In my view, this
                    objection was thin in the light of evidence adduced by D2. Moreover, the
                    expenses were verified by Lim Shwu Peng, a former accounts executive of Falmac
                    as well as Falmac’s financial controller.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outcome of D2’s counterclaim: a summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    In light of the discussion above, I now
                    summarise my findings on D2’s Counterclaim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_1"></a>(1)     
            <em>Salary
                            arrears</em>: D2 succeeds in his claim for the amounts of
                        S$942,186.40 and S$183,333.33 being salary arrears as of 20 July 2009, which
                        was the date of D2’s cessation of service.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_2"></a>(2)     
            <em>Loan to
                            Falmac</em>: This loan amount of S$30,000 was reflected in
                        Falmac’s 2008 statements of account<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span> and also confirmed by Lim Shwu
                        Peng, a former accounts executive of Falmac.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></span> The
                        loan was also not disputed by Wong in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, this claim of S$30,000
                        is allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_3"></a>(3)     
            <em>Director’s fees</em>: This claim of
                        S$45,000 is allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_4"></a>(4)     
            <em>Severance compensation</em>: This claim of
                        S$500,000 is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_5"></a>(5)     
            <em>Credit card expenses</em>: This
                        amount of S$56,202.23 for the reimbursement of travelling and other expenses
                        incurred on his credit card is allowed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_6"></a>(6)     
            <em>Reimbursement for amounts
                            paid to IRAS</em>: The reimbursements are for the amount of
                        S$57,780.35 being income tax payments to IRAS, as well as the amount of
                        S$24,530.94 being payments to IRAS which had allegedly been deducted from
                        D2’s personal accounts. Pursuant to clause 11 of the Employment
                        Contract (see [160] above), Falmac was responsible for D2’s liability.
                        Thus, D2’s claim for S$57,780.35, which was evidenced by an IRAS
                        statement of account dated 12 January 2011 is allowed. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span> With regard
                        to the amount of S$24,530.94 claimed by D2, the IRAS statement of account
                        dated 11 April 2009 produced only indicated a balance of S$21,123.62 but as
                        Wong accepted the claim figure of S$24,530.94, and Mr Quek did not object to
                        this item of claim and quantum in his Closing Submissions, the claim of
                        S$24,530.94 is allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_7"></a>(7)     
            <em>Indemnity from IRAS or credit card
                            companies</em>: This relief is sought in D2’s pleadings but
                        it was not developed and pursued in Mr Singh’s Closing Submissions.
                        Accordingly, no order is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    In conclusion, Falmac’s action against
                    D2 is dismissed. As for D2’s Counterclaim, there is judgment in favour of
                    D2 in the total sum of $1,339,033.25 together with interest thereon at the rate
                    of 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ to payment. Falmac is to pay
                    D2’s costs of the action and counterclaim.</p>
