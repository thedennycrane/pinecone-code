<p align="justify">1 This is an appeal by the Defendant arising out of his application (SIC 789 of

2000) made under Order 18 rule 19(b) and (d) and under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court

seeking the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) the Plaintiffs Statement of Claim be struck out and the action

  dismissed;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the Defendants costs incurred in defending this action, the costs of

  this application and the costs of the application in SIC 643 of 2000 filed on 29 August 2000 be

  borne by the Plaintiffs on an indemnity basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2 The Senior Assistant Registrar dismissed the Defendants application with

costs fixed at $1,500.</p>
<p align="justify">3 I allowed the Defendants appeal and ordered the Plaintiffs to pay the

Defendant $3,500 as the costs of the entire action.</p>
<p align="justify">4 The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiffs present action was frivolous,

vexations and an abuse of process of Court as it was nothing more than an attempt to re-litigate the

causes of actions and the issues in five earlier actions by the Defendant and that there were no

merits in the Plaintiffs allegations.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE BACKGROUND AND THE ARGUMENTS</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">5 The Plaintiffs commenced the present action on 26 June 2000. Their Statement of

Claim was in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore and having its

  office at 27 Apex Tower #27-00 Singapore 079905.</p>
<p align="justify">2. At the request of the Defendant from time to time between the period of 1995

  to 1998 the Defendant delivered a number of shipments of various Chinese antiques, (purported to

  have been exported out of the People Republic of China) to the Plaintiff. As acknowledgement of

  the estimated value the said goods (antiques) delivered, the Plaintiff issued a number of cheques

  and some from their chairman, Mr Tong Djoe at the material time. The total value of these cheques

  amounted to $649,000.00 in 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Defendant subsequent commenced action in late 1998 against the Plaintiff

  and their chairman claiming the sale of the Chinese antiques and instituted actions for the value

  of these antiques delivered based on the cheques received and presented for payment but were

  dishonoured on presentation. The Plaintiff maintained that the goods (antiques) were held by them

  as bailor and therefore disputed that the cheques were meant to be presented for payment.</p>
<p align="justify">4, The Defendant in his actions in Suit 2037 of 1998 was for $565,000.00 and in

  DC Suit No. 6583 of 1998 for $64,000.00 against Mr Tong Djoe for the proceeds of sale of antiques

  based on the cheques issued by them.</p>
<p align="justify">5. By an agreement and in settlement of the Defendants actions in Suit No.

  2037 of 1998 and DC 6583 of 1998, the terms of the settlement were described in the Plaintiffs

  solicitors letter dated 15<sup>th</sup> December 1998, which was duly accepted by the Defendant

  through his solicitor on the 17<sup>th</sup> December 1998. The settlement were meant for all the

  antiques delivered to the Plaintiff which were agreed at $324,500.00 subject to the following

  terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) $32,450.00 being 10% to be paid within 7 days</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Thereafter 18 monthly instalments of $16,225.00</p>
<p align="justify">in exchange the Defendant was to deliver</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) all the cheques concerned</p>
<p align="justify">(b) a letter of indemnity for any claim arising from the cheques concerned</p>
<p align="justify">(c) To file the Notice of Discontinuance of both action on settlement or

      agreement of terms</p>
<p align="justify">(d) all shipping documents, invoices, custom clearance documents as

      inspected and accepted and be exchanged on receipt of 1<sup>st</sup> instalment payment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Pursuant to the agreement, inspection took place where various invoices and

    shipping documents were inspected but the actual exchange did not take place at all despite

    attempts to carry out the exchange on 25<sup>th</sup> March and 30<sup>th</sup> March 1998.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">6. In fact, the cheques concerned were handed over to the Defendants

  solicitors as stakeholders pending the exchange. Further the notices of discontinuance of both

  actions and the letter of indemnity were also similarly handed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff

  solicitors.</p>
<p align="justify">7. (a) Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the sum of $10,000.00, $8,000.00

  and $8,000.00 were paid by the Plaintiff prior to the intended exchange to demonstrate the

  Plaintiff intention to pay under the terms of settlement. The exchange of the balance of the

  documents described in paragraph 5(d) above were to be exchanged and furnished by the Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Subsequently, without providing all the documents to be exchanged described

  in paragraph 5(d) above under the terms of settlement, the Defendant commenced numerous actions

  for the payments due under the terms of the agreement. They are:</p>

<p align="justify">8 (a) The Plaintiff solicitors were instructed to enter appearance to all the

  above actions referred to in paragraph 7(b) above but were instructed not to reply to the Order 14

  applications for summary judgment as the Plaintiff intended at all times to make payment under the

  terms of settlement. All the judgment entered in paragraph 7 above were satisfied except for the

  21/2000G where the sum of $68,309.02 is being held by the Defendants solicitors as

  stakeholders pending an application to set aside the default judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) By the payment of $136,300.00 described in paragraph 7 above, the Plaintiff

  have made payment under the terms of settlement beyond the 1<sup>st</sup> instalment payment and

  more.</p>
<p align="justify">9. In addition, the Plaintiff was laboring under the believe at the material

  time by the Defendants oral assurances given from time to time that he had those documents

  agreed and described in paragraph 5(d) above, especially the custom clearance papers, to confirm

  the country of origin of the goods (antiques) imported and that he was willing and able to hand

  them over as agreed under the terms of settlement.</p>
<p align="justify">10. On the 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2000, the Plaintiff through their solicitors

  objected to the judgment entered in default of appearance when the Memorandum of Appearance

  submitted to be filed electronically on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of March was rejected and

  thereafter the Plaintiff Memorandum of Appearance filed was minutes late before judgment was

  entered on the 15<sup>th</sup> March 2000. The Plaintiff also intimated that the agreed documents

  under the terms of settlement were still outstanding and have not yet been furnished by the

  Defendant. The Defendant failed or refused to furnish the documents concerned or reply on the

  matter.</p>
<p align="justify">11. On the 12<sup>th</sup> June 2000 the Plaintiff demanded the production of

  the documents to be delivered by the Defendant under the term of the settlement in particular

  those described under paragraph 5(d) above.</p>
<p align="justify">12. However, the Defendant in reply refused to provide any of the documents and

  thereby breached the fundamental term of the settlement. As a result the Plaintiff is unable to

  provide proof that the antiques were from the Peoples Republic of China and put to suffer loss

  and damages by the Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">13. And the Plaintiff claims</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Specific performance by the Defendant to deliver the said documents

    described in paragraphs 5(d) above.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Damages for the detention of the documents concerned.</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Further and other relief as the Court deems fit.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) costs</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. Alternatively, the Plaintiff claim</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Damages;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Loss from the sale of the antiques without the certification of origin;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Further and other relief as the Court thinks fit</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) Costs</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15. In addition, the Plaintiff pray for an order that pending the decision of

  the Court the sum of $68,309.02 in the solicitors accounts of the Defendant, M/s Drew &amp;

  Napier, which may be payable to the Defendant be restrained from being dealt with by the Defendant

  in any way or pay to the Defendant or remit by the Defendant out of jurisdiction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">6 The settlement agreement referred to in the Statement of Claim was contained in

the Plaintiffs solicitors letter dated 15 December 1998 and the Defendants solicitors

letter dated 17 December 1998. The 15 December 1998 letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"<b><u>SUIT NO 2037 OF 1998 and DC Suit 6583 of 1998</u></b></p>
<p align="justify">1. Our clients, the company accepts that their Chairman, Mr Tong Djoes

  cheques were drawn to pay on behalf of the company and therefore acknowledges that the cheques in

  the 2<sup>nd</sup> action above were part of the additional cheques to be paid by them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Upon satisfactory conclusion of the terms of settlement our clients shall

  issue payment of 10% of the settlement sum within 7 days.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Therefore our clients shall issue the 18 monthly installments and it would

  be convenient if the addresses were given for the sending of the cheque for each month.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The terms of settlement to be accepted by the parties are subject to the

  following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a) Inspection of all the original cheques concerned with the total of

    $649,000-00 and the settlement sum is $324,500-00. 10% would be $32,450-00 and each equal

    monthly installment is $16,225-00 for 18 months.</p>
<p align="justify">b) All original cheques are handed to our clients upon receipt of the 10%

    payment and your client or his solicitor is entitled to cancel all the cheques handed over.</p>
<p align="justify">c) an indemnity in the terms acceptable by our clients against all the

    cheques for any claim arising thereof should be handed to our clients in exchange for the first

    payment.</p>
<p align="justify">d) All shipping documents, invoices, custom clearance documents to be

    inspected and accepted and be exchanged on receipt of the 1<sup>st</sup> installment payment of

    10%.</p>
<p align="justify">e) That on acceptance of the terms of settlement your client shall forthwith

    file the Notice of Discontinuance for the above actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5. Please confirm the above are the terms agreed by the parties so that we can

  proceed with inspection and drafting of the terms of indemnity for the acceptance.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The payment made in exchange of the cheques and the documents described in

  paragraph 4 (d) above should take place within this week.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Could you confirm the above as in order and acceptable? We would be able

  tomorrow to inspect the items in 4(a) and 4(d)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The 17 December 1998 letter accepted the above in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We refer to your "Without Prejudice" letter addressed to us

  dated 15 December 1998 and the subsequent telephone conversation between your Mr Peter Pang and

  our Diana The today.</p>
<p align="justify">We confirm that the terms contained therein have been accepted by our clients.

  We undertake to forward the original copy of the duly executed Indemnity Agreement within 14 days

  of the exchange."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7 The Defendant conceded that a formal exchange of payment against documents did

not take place but averred in paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence (with 14 paragraphs of

particulars) that it was due to the Plaintiffs fault. The Defendant also averred in paragraph 26

of the Amended Defence that the Plaintiffs were estopped from alleging that they were entitled to

any documents or that the said exchange was incomplete. Reliance was placed on the particulars given

in paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence as well as 12 more paragraphs of particulars. It was further

averred that the Plaintiffs had waived strict compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement

and the requirement of an exchange and that the Plaintiffs had affirmed the settlement agreement. In

any case, the Defendant said, the Plaintiffs were estopped from alleging breach by the Defendant as

a result of the five judgments obtained by the Defendant against the Plaintiffs in the five earlier

suits.</p>
<p align="justify">8 Paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence averred as follows ("GPP" refers

to the Defendants then solicitors and "PP&amp;Co" refers to the Plaintiffs

solicitors):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"16. The Defendant was ready, able and willing to carry out the Exchange.

  The Exchange did not take place on 25 and 30 March 1999, or at all, at the fault of the

  Plaintiffs.</p>
<u>
<p align="center">Particulars</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">a. By a letter dated 8 January 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP proposed that

  the Exchange be conducted on 12 January 1999 at 10 am. By a letter dated 12 January 1999 from

  PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co replied that the Plaintiffs (chairman) were in Indonesia;</p>
<p align="justify">b. By a letter dated 21 January 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP required

  PP&amp;Co to conduct the Exchange by 22 January 1999. By a letter dated 29 January 1999 from

  PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co replied that the Plaintiffs chairman was still outstation;</p>
<p align="justify">c. Instead, the Plaintiffs forwarded a cheque for the sum of S$10,000.00 to GPP;</p>
<p align="justify">d. By a letter dated 1 February from PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co requested that

  all the original cheques to be forwarded to them;</p>
<p align="justify">e. By a letter dated 3 February 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP requested the

  exchange to take place by that week. By a letter inadvertently dated 29 January 1999 but received

  by GPP on 5 February 1999, PP&amp;Co replied that the Plaintiffs chairman was still outstation;</p>
<p align="justify">f. By a letter dated 2 March 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP required the

  Plaintiffs to pay the balance of S$32,4500.00 by 10 March 1999. By a letter dated 8 March 1999

  from PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co replied that the Plaintiffs chairman was still outstation;</p>
<p align="justify">g. By a letter dated 19 March 1999 from PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co proposed

  that the exchange be effected on 25 March 1999 at PP&amp;Cos office. Further, PP&amp;Co

  requested confirmation that a sum of S$10,000.00 and S$8,000.00 had been forwarded;</p>
<p align="justify">h. By a letter dated 23 March 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP denied that a

  second sum of S$8,000.00 had been received. Further, GPP also requested the balance payment to be

  forwarded to GPP given that the original cheques and original indemnity had been forwarded to

  PP&amp;Co;</p>
<p align="justify">i. By a letter dated 24 March 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP offered to attend

  at PP&amp;Cos office on 25 March 1999;</p>
<p align="justify">j. By a letter dated 24 March 1999 from PP&amp;Co and received by GPP on 25

  March 1999 at 2.58 pm, PP&amp;Co insisted that a further sum of S$8,000.090 had been forwarded and

  a balance payment of S$14,450.00 would be issued. PP&amp;Co concluded the letter by saying that

  "We need in return the indemnity (witnessed) in exchange";</p>
<p align="justify">k. By a letter dated 26 March 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP reserved the

  issue of the receipt of the S$8,000.00 to be resolved through litigation, and proposed that the

  exchange take place on 30 March 1999 at 3 pm at PP&amp;Cos office;</p>
<p align="justify">l. By a letter inadvertently dated 29 January 1999 and faxed to GPP on 30 March

  1999 at 4.58 pm, PP&amp;Co stated that a separate sum of S$8,000.00 was attached to the letter and

  that the balance sum of S$6,000.00 would be given in the week following. PP&amp;Co also requested

  the documents for the exchange to be delivered;</p>
<p align="justify">m. By a letter dated 31 March 1999 from GPP to PP&amp;Co, GPP replied that the

  balance sum should be S$6,450.00 and required payment by 1 April 1999; and</p>
<p align="justify">n. By a letter dated 29 April 1999 from PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co forwarded

  the balance sum of S$6,450.00 to GPP. (Taking into account the S$8,000.00 that is in dispute, this

  payment completed the exchange sum of S$32,450.00, and the time for payment of the 18 instalments

  starts to run).".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">9 Paragraph 26 of the Amended Defence was in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"26. The Plaintiffs are estopped by its conduct from alleging that it is

  entitled to any documents or that the Exchange is uncompleted.</p>

<p align="justify">a. The Defendant repeats the particulars to paragraph 16 above;</p>
<p align="justify">b. By a letter dated 2 June 1999 from PP&amp;Co to GPP, PP&amp;Co replied that

  the Plaintiffs (chairman) would be in Singapore by 15 June 1999 to issue payment for the 1<sup>st</sup>

  of the 18 instalments.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">10 Before the commencement of the present action, the Defendant had instituted

five suits in the Subordinate Courts for the recovery of the instalments that had fallen due under

the settlement agreement and had obtained judgment in four of them. The fifth judgment was obtained

shortly after the commencement of the present action. In each of those five suits, it was pleaded by

the present Defendant that the first of the 18 instalments was due and payable on 29 May 1999 and

that the remaining 17 were due and payable on the 29<sup>th</sup> day of each subsequent month.</p>
<p align="justify">11 The Defendant argued that the two judgments under Order 14 and the three

judgments under Order 13 and Order 19 in the said five suits precluded the Plaintiffs here from

asserting there had been a breach. Further, the Plaintiffs present allegations could and should

have been raised in any of the said five suits. However, the Plaintiffs decided not to contest those

actions and allowed judgment to be entered in each of them. After judgment in default of appearance

had been obtained in DC Suit 21 of 2000, the present Plaintiffs applied to have the judgment set

aside. The application was heard by a Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts on 27 July 2000 and

was dismissed on 11 August 2000. The present Plaintiffs appealed. The appeal was dismissed by a

District Judge on 11 November 2000. The issues in DC Suit 21 of 2000 and those in the present action

were the same. The Plaintiffs have applied for leave to appeal to the High Court.</p>
<p align="justify">12 The Defendant further submitted there were no merits in the Plaintiffs

present allegations as it was plain from the various correspondence pleaded and exhibited that the

exchange did not take place in the manner provided in the settlement agreement because of the

Plaintiffs own fault.</p>
<p align="justify">13 The Plaintiffs argued that the customs clearance documents were never handed

over to them or their solicitors. Their solicitors letters dated 16 June 2000 and 21 June 2000 to

the Defendants present solicitors read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(16 June 2000)</p>
<p align="justify">"<b>RE: TERMS OF SETTLEMENT ACCEPTED 17<sup>TH</sup> DECEMBER 1998</b></p>
<p align="justify">BETWEEN TUNAS PTE LTD AND MR NG MAN-LEONG</p>
<p align="justify">1. We have your letter of 15<sup>th</sup> June 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In view of your clients refusal to furnish any of the outstanding

  documents agreed under the terms of settlement and even made no attempt to mitigate the situation

  by furnishing some of the outstanding documents agreed in exchange, our client has no option but

  to hold your client in breach of the terms of settlement.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Our client therefore reserves their rights to seek specific performance and

  in the alternative seek damages against for all losses suffered.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In the event we are seeking the recovery of the losses, it would include all

  monies paid to date by our client. We have instructions to include preservatory orders where

  applicable.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Accordingly, on expiry, we are instructed to proceed to institute

  proceedings without delay."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">(21 June 2000)</p>
<p align="justify">"1. We refer to the above matter and our letter of 16<sup>th</sup> June

  2000.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We are instructed to file in the High Court the action for specific

  performance and alternatively to recover damages suffered arising therefrom.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Your client in DC 21/2000/G and MC 8588/2000/Y are therefore related and

  should be consolidated to avoid multiple duplicate proceedings arising from the same matter.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In this context, would your client agree to let the High Court case be a

  test case and that the order be applicable accordingly to the other two matters.</p>
<p align="justify">5. As for DC 21 of 2000/Y, will your client consent to our client application

  to set aside the judgment entered on 15<sup>th</sup> March 2000 or your clients agreement to

  the above be subject to our client succeeding in setting aside the judgment?</p>
<p align="justify">6. We appreciate your reply within 7 days from date hereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14 The Defendants solicitors replied on 27 June 2000 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. We refer to your letter dated 16 June 2000 and 21 June 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In view of your clients conduct and all the correspondence, the

  allegation that our client is in breach of the settlement agreement is outrageous. Our client has

  not breached the settlement agreement, and there is, therefore, no duty to mitigate.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be that as it may, we note your clients allegations that there are

  outstanding documents, and that they are prejudiced from discovering the origin of the goods. We

  also note from Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners letter dated 17 December 1998 that copies of the

  documents were handed to you, and that your letter dated 29 December 2000 clearly shows that your

  clients had accepted the documents.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In the circumstances, is all this just to obtain another set of the

  documents? If so, despite the fact that our client has discharged all his obligations, we will

  provide your client with another set of the documents.</p>
<p align="justify">5. That is our clients position. Beyond that, we see no point in

  corresponding further on this subject, parties are clearly set to litigate. We will leave it to

  the court to adjudicate on this case. Our clients will proceed in accordance with their legal

  rights.</p>
<p align="justify">6. As for your suggestion to use the High Court case as a test case, the

  proposal is unacceptable. Our client has had enough of your clients dilatory conduct, and there

  is simply no way of ensuring that your client will proceed expeditiously.</p>
<p align="justify">7. If a High Court action is commenced, and preservatory orders are sought, you

  are hereby put on notice that we object to any applications being made ex-parte.</p>
<p align="justify">8. For the avoidance of doubt, all our clients rights are reserved including

  the right to dispute the appropriateness of commencing a High Court action."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15 Before me, Mr Peter Pang stated that if the said customs clearance documents

were handed over to him, he would withdraw the present action. He was compelled to commence this

suit because of the Defendants solicitors insistence that they had been handed over when they

were not.</p>
<p align="justify">16 He argued that the Plaintiffs allowed the five judgments to be entered in the

Subordinate Courts because the Plaintiffs wished to affirm the settlement agreement despite the

Defendants breach. Since they were so affirming, they were obliged to pay and their right to sue

for damages had not been waived or abandoned in any way.</p>
<p align="justify">17 The Defendant responded by stating that although no inventory list of all the

documents was prepared, the Plaintiffs had not complained about the customs clearance documents

being missing until March 2000 when a Writ of Seizure and Sale was taken out in DC Suit 21 of 2000.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">18 Comparing the documents in the five actions in the Subordinate Courts and

those in the present suit, it was clear to me that the Plaintiffs present suit was nothing more

than a repetition of the same issues which had been put to rest by the Plaintiffs decision to

allow judgment to be entered in any of the five suits.</p>
<p align="justify">19 By submitting to judgment and paying the instalments, the Plaintiffs had

acknowledged that the instalments were due under the settlement agreement. They could not have been

due if the exchange of documents was not done or was not completed satisfactorily. They were

therefore estopped in all the circumstances of this case from alleging that the exchange was

incomplete. In any event, the formal exchange was not carried out due to the Plaintiffs fault.</p>
<p align="justify">20 The Plaintiffs could not decide when and where they would raise matters when

those matters had already been put in issue in earlier proceedings and, in this instance, many times

over. If they chose not to contest the Defendants actions or to allow the summary judgments

therein to stand, they could not now attempt to shake the factual foundation on which those

judgments rest. The instalments stage was premised upon the exchange stage having been completed

satisfactorily. If the exchange stage had not been so, it was incumbent on the Plaintiffs to

challenge that the instalments were due at all or at least to insist that any judgment entered

reflect the status of the exchange. By electing not to do so, they could not now be permitted to

rake up what had been interred with their consent or knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify">21 If any breach of the settlement agreement had taken place, it was on the part

of the Plaintiffs. It was their lackadaisical attitude in carrying out the terms that threw

everything out of the order intended. They could not now be permitted to sue on what was essentially

their own wrongdoing. The present claim was therefore devoid of merit in any case.</p>
<p align="justify">22 I therefore allowed the appeal and granted the Defendant the orders sought. I

fixed the costs of the entire action payable by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant at $3,500.</p>
