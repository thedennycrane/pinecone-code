special purpose vehicle company, BRR (“the SPV”). While the Project was underway, the SPV ran out of funds, and BRQ (“the Buyer”) entered the picture as an investor to inject fresh funds for the Project to continue. Under a Securities Purchase Agreement (“the SPA”), the Buyer contracted to buy all the shares in the SPV. In the SPA, it was envisaged that the Project would be completed or “wet commissioned” by 31 March 2013, and further that the Project cost would be about S$170m (“the Project Cost”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Project was not wet commissioned on 31 March 2013. For present purposes, the parties proceeded on the premise that the Project achieved wet commissioning more than two years later on 31 October 2015. As a result of delays in the Project, and as the actual costs of the Project exceeded the Project Cost, the Buyer and the SPV (collectively, “the Claimants”) initiated arbitration proceedings against the Seller, claiming payment for the additional costs above the Project Cost and damages that were incurred due to the delay in completion. The arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”) issued a final award that was in substance in favour of the Claimants (“the Award”). However, it limited the Seller’s liability with respect to certain time-dependent components to 30 June 2014 (the “Cut-off Date”). In the Tribunal’s view, the Project could have achieved wet commissioning on the Cut-off Date (rather than the eventual date of 31 October 2015) if the Claimants had undertaken the construction and commissioning of the Project in the most prudent and cost-effective manner after their takeover of the Project in early 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Both the Seller and Claimants were dissatisfied with various aspects of the Award, and they each filed separate Originating Summonses to set aside portions of the Award, on the bases that the Tribunal had either acted in breach of natural justice and/or in excess of its jurisdiction. Both setting-aside applications were dismissed by the High Court judge (“the Judge”), giving rise to the present appeals.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The facts are largely undisputed, and both parties accept that the background to the dispute have been distilled at [5]–[25] of the Judge’s grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">BRQ and another v BRS and another and another matter </span>[2019] SGHC 260 (“the GD”).

This meant that the three-month time limit to commence such an application began on that date. By filing its application on 22 June 2018, the Seller had exceeded the three-month time limit stipulated under Art 34(3) of the Model Law. On the other hand, the Seller submitted that on 1 March 2018, it had requested the Tribunal to correct the Award in various respects under Art 33 of the Model Law. We will refer to this alleged correction request as “the Correction Request”. The Seller submitted that as the Tribunal had dismissed the Correction Request only on 23 March 2018, the three-month time limit to apply to court to set aside the Award only began to run from 23 March 2018. Hence its application to court filed on 22 June 2018 was filed within time.

Furthermore, no prejudice was caused to the Seller as even if the correspondence was inadmissible, this would have had no bearing on the Tribunal’s finding that the Seller was liable for the Cost Overrun, as the Project had exceeded the Project Cost (GD at [91]–[92]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, the Judge also determined that the Tribunal was not in breach of natural justice or in excess of its jurisdiction when it found that the Seller would be liable for the Cost Overrun even if the Seller was not in breach of the SPA (“the Breach issue”).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In the Judge’s finding, the Claimants’ pleaded case was that the Seller would be liable for Cost Overrun once the Project Cost had been exceeded and this was independent of a breach on the Seller’s part (GD at [98]–[103]). For the same reason, the Tribunal did not exceed its jurisdiction, as it correctly apprehended the true basis of the Claimants’ case (GD at [111]). Even if the Seller only knew that this was the Claimants’ case on the last day of oral hearings, the Seller then had a reasonable opportunity to present its case in the intervening four months during which parties were entitled to file their closing submissions (GD at [107]–[108]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Third, the Judge rejected the Seller’s assertion that the Tribunal was in breach of natural justice as it had failed to give parties the opportunity to address which components of the Cost Overrun were time-dependent (“the Time-dependency issue”). Even without the benefit of arguments specifically on whether each Cost Overrun component was or was not time-dependent, the full extent of the evidence on the Cost Overrun components was before the Tribunal. This would have been sufficient for the Tribunal to come to a conclusion on whether each component was time-dependent, and an error by the Tribunal in this regard was not a basis for setting aside the award (GD at [123]–[125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Fourth, the Judge did not consider that the Tribunal was in breach of natural justice by failing to consider the Seller’s “extensive submissions” on why it could not be liable for the transmission line costs (“the Transmission Line issue”). The Seller’s defence in relation to the Transmission Line issue was that it had no liability whatsoever as it was the Buyer who was throughout the <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>controller of the works. This was implicitly rejected by the Tribunal, which found that the Cost Overrun included “any and all project cost in excess of” the Project Cost. This would include any costs incurred for the transmission line works, which could therefore be added to the Cost Overrun claim (GD at [130]–[132]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Fifth, the Judge rejected the submission that the Tribunal was in breach of natural justice or had acted in excess of its jurisdiction in denying the Seller’s counterclaim for the SSL (“the SSL issue”). In his view, the Tribunal clearly and properly considered this issue, and found that the entire SSL stood adjusted towards the amount specified in the Cost Overrun Notice, and this extinguished the SSL entirely (GD at [143]–[146]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Sixth, the Tribunal did not fail to consider (but in fact, explicitly considered) the Seller’s arguments that the BPTA Charges claim should be rejected entirely (“the BPTA Charges issue”). The Seller’s real complaint was that the Tribunal had arrived at a conclusion that was against what it had advocated (GD at [151] and [157]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Finally, on the issue of whether the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice when it awarded the Claimants pre-award interest on the Cost Overrun claim from 4 July 2014 (“the Pre-award interest issue”), it was held that while neither party had argued for the interest to start from such an early date, the issue of the pre-award interest was in the discretion of the Tribunal, as provided under s 20(1) of the IAA (GD at [161]). In any event, the date of 4 July 2014 was not “plucked from the air”, as it was the date when the Claimants sent a legal notice of the Cost Overrun claim to the Seller (GD at [164]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Claimants’ setting-aside application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Judge also dismissed the Claimants’ setting-aside application, which was a focussed attack against the Tribunal’s finding that the Seller’s liability for certain time-dependent components was limited to the Cut-off Date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 First, the Claimants alleged that the Tribunal had overlooked or failed to apply its mind to various pieces of evidence, which would have shown that the Project could not have been wet commissioned by the Cut-off Date of 30 June 2014. The evidence that was allegedly overlooked pertained to the penstock and transmission line. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As regards the penstock, the Judge considered that the Tribunal did not act in breach of natural justice by failing to consider reports tendered by the Claimants showing that the works to the penstock were the “<span class="font-italic">only </span>recommended option” and “technically appropriate”. Even if such works were <span class="font-italic">necessary</span>, they were, in the Tribunal’s view, outside the contractual stipulations for the penstock, and were thus irrelevant to the issue of whether the Claimants had adopted the most prudent and cost-effective method of repairing the penstock (GD at [173]–[176]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Also, while the Tribunal had made no reference to the transmission line evidence, which showed that the transmission line works were completed only on 17 October 2015, a possible explanation for the Tribunal’s omission was that it believed that the ongoing transmission line works were of no factual or legal relevance to the wet commissioning of the Project. Even if this was a manifest error, this did not amount to a breach of natural justice sufficient to set aside the Award (GD at [185]–[188]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Second, while the Claimants submitted that the Cut-off Date was “entirely arbitrary”, and “not based on any evidence put forth by any party”, this was contradicted by the Claimants’ own case that it had put forward arguments which showed that the Project could not have been completed earlier than 17 October 2015, showing that parties had submitted on the earliest completion date (or the appropriate Cut-off Date).

</div> Instead, it was a disguised attempt to seek a review of the merits of the Award, since each of the Seller’s requests would have required the Tribunal to overturn its express findings of fact. Hence, the three-month time limit under Art 34(3) of the Model Law was not extended, and the Seller’s setting-aside application, having been filed on 22 June 2018 (more than three months after the Award was received on 31 January 2018), was time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In response, the Seller submitted that the court ought not to be concerned with whether a correction request was in substance an Art 33 correction request.

</div> In that case, the respondent received the tribunal’s award on 7 November 2015. Subsequently, the respondent made an application to correct the tribunal’s award on 16 November 2015. This request was dismissed by the tribunal on 14 December 2015. On 11 March 2016, more than three months after the respondent received the award, but within three months of the date of disposal of the correction request, the respondent applied under s 34 of the Indian 1996 Act to set aside the award. The only issue before the Indian Supreme Court was whether the setting-aside application had been made within the three-month time limit under s 34(3) of the Indian 1996 Act. The district judge held that the respondent’s application was time-barred, as the application should have been made within three months from the date of receipt, given that there was no correction made to the award (<span class="font-italic">Ved</span><span class="font-italic"> Prakash Mithal </span>at [4]). This was rejected by the Supreme Court of India, which reasoned that “a ‘disposal’ of the application [under s 34(3) of the Indian 1996 Act] can be either by allowing it or dismissing it” (<span class="font-italic">Ved</span><span class="font-italic"> Prakash Mithal </span>at [8]). Hence, notwithstanding that the correction request was dismissed by the tribunal, it sufficed to extend time under s 34(3), such that the setting-aside application was not time-barred. According to the Seller, this meant that the period for filing an application for setting-aside “will run from the date of decision of an application made under Section 33 of the [Indian 1996 Act], whether the same is allowed or dismissed” [emphasis in original removed].

In that case, the applicant (“Todd”) filed a request for an additional award relating to transport charges under the equivalent of Art 33(3) of the Model Law (“the Transport Charges question”). While its additional award request was pending before the arbitrator, both parties filed applications to the New Zealand High Court, seeking to appeal a number of questions arising from the arbitrator’s award. However, since its additional award request was pending before the arbitrator, Todd did not refer the Transport Charges question to the court. Eventually, the arbitrator denied Todd’s request for an additional award. Todd then applied to refer the Transport Charges question to the court, but this was dismissed by the High Court judge, who held that Todd’s additional award request did not operate to extend time under Art 34(3). According to the judge, Todd could not reasonably treat it as “a <span class="font-italic">proper</span> application in the sense of being within the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to consider, and tenable on the evidence and outcomes to that point” (<span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum </span>at [20]–[21] referring to <span class="font-italic">Shell (Petroleum Mining) Company Limited v Todd Petroleum Mining Company Limited </span>CIV-2009-485-2024 (8 June 2010) at [16] and [140]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On appeal, the respondent (“Shell”) sought to uphold the judge’s decision while not endorsing the particular language of “proper” request employed by the High Court. Shell submitted that “[i]n order to defer time in which to appeal from running under art 34(3), … the request must objectively satisfy the requirements for the exercise of jurisdiction under art 33” (<span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum </span>at [24]). In other words, Shell posited that only a request that is <span class="font-italic">granted </span>by the tribunal will operate to extend time under art 34(3) (see <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum </span>at [37]–[39]). Todd challenged Shell’s approach, contending that time was automatically extended “whenever a party to an arbitral award makes a request for an additional award under art 33(3). There is no additional qualitative requirement for the request to meet any merit-based threshold” (<span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum </span>at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The New Zealand Court of Appeal rejected Shell’s approach, holding thus (<span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum </span>at [37]–[41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 There is no support in the statutory language of either arts 33(3) or 34(3) for a qualitative gloss on the nature of the request for an additional award. We reject Shell’s submission to the contrary. Adding a qualitative requirement that a request under art 33(3) be a “proper” request would mean that a party would not know whether it has made a request in terms of that article until the arbitral tribunal either grants or rejects its application. Moreover, the notion of a requirement for a proper request is inconsistent with the language of art 34(3) which speaks only of a request being “disposed of”. It is not limited to cases where the request is “granted”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>We agree with the submission by [counsel for Todd] that, if the drafters of art 34(3) had intended only to extend time for art 33 requests that were to be accepted by the arbitrator, it would have been easy to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 One consequence of an interpretation adding this qualitative requirement is that the requesting party may be obliged to file in the High Court an application for leave to appeal to preserve its appeal rights. This is because if its request has not been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal within the three-month time period allowed for seeking leave to appeal against an arbitral award, the party will lose its right to recourse from the High Court under art 34(4). Under Shell’s interpretation, that party cannot be sure time will stop running under art 34(3). The party will not know whether the tribunal will consider its “request” to be a proper request until it has been determined.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 This would be inconsistent with the policy of maintaining the integrity of the arbitration process and placing limits on the role of domestic courts in private litigation. To require a requesting party to file both a request for an additional award and apply for leave to appeal to the High Court at the same time is not consistent with the policy of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 The legislative history of the Model Law says little about the inter-relationship between arts 33 and 34(3). On the question of time limits, the Fourth Report of the Working Group noted that the time periods under art 33 ought to be taken into account when ultimately fixing the time for bringing a setting aside or omission claim under art 34(3). Including the reference to art 33 was a reasonable consequence of allowing applications. Its Fourth Report supports the proposition the Model Law intended all requests under art 33 should operate to stop time running for challenging an award under art 34(3) and pointed to those time-limits as a mechanism to prevent delay tactics. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The New Zealand Court of Appeal summarised its reasons for declining to include a qualitative gloss to Art 33 requests as follows (<span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum </span>at [56]–[58]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the NZ 1996 Act is intended to be publicly accessible and user friendly so that it is comprehensible to both lawyers and lay persons alike. That goal would be defeated by the inevitable complexity introduced by a qualitative requirement which is not apparent or necessary on the words of the articles concerned.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the applicable time limits in Art 34(3) are firm in that there is no discretion to extend them. Preferring an interpretation which does not include a qualitative gloss on the statutory wording would serve the imperatives of certainty and finality in arbitration proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the policy in favour of autonomy of the parties to choose the tribunal to determine their dispute is preserved by the interpretation which the court was upholding, as it limited the court’s review of arbitral awards.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s view on </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Todd Petroleum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Judge accepted the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Todd</span> <span class="font-italic">Petroleum</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> He was of the view that any concern about the abuse of Art 33 of the Model Law, if there was no qualitative requirement, was overstated as there were certain time frames within Art 33 which constrain the temporal effect of any abuse. In his view, this approach was supported by the Report of the Working Group behind the Model Law (GD at [49]):        </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 Finally, there is no evidence that the drafters of the Model Law intended that the second limb of Art 34(3) be triggered by a qualitative test. On the contrary, the discussion of Art 34(3) in the seventh session of the UNCITRAL Working Group on International Contract Practices (“Report of the Working Group on International Contract Practices on the Work of its Seventh Session”, UNCITRAL, 17th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/246 (“Report of the Working Group”) at para 138) shows that the drafters were alive to the risk of abuse without a qualitative test, but considered it a constrained risk and accepted that risk in the current drafting of Art 34(3):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As regards the words “or, if a request had been made under article 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal”, there was considerable support for deleting those words since they might open the door for dilatory tactics by a party and because an unbreakable time-limit for applications for setting aside was desirable for the sake of certainty and expediency. <span class="font-italic">The prevailing view, however, was to retain those words since they presented the reasonable consequence of article 33 which allowed a party to request a correction, interpretation or an additional award</span>. <span class="font-italic">It was also pointed out that</span> <span class="font-italic">the periods of time contained in article 33 enabled the arbitral tribunal to minimize the risk of dilatory tactics and provided a basis for calculating the possible extension of the time-limit prescribed in paragraph (3) of article 34</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Judge was also concerned that a qualitative test would introduce great uncertainty post-award. No one would know when an award is indeed final until the qualitative determination is made. That uncertainty would also lead to a potential waste of time and costs as a party making the request under Art 33 would file a concurrent setting-aside application in court under Art 34 out of an abundance of caution (GD at [47] and [48]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Our decision on the Phrase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 However, it seems to us that undue reliance was placed on <span class="font-italic">Todd</span> <span class="font-italic">Petroleum</span> by the Seller and by the Judge. In that case, the qualitative requirement was that the request must be acceded to before the extension of time under Art 34(3) would kick in (see [59] above). That was not the argument before us. The Claimants were not suggesting that the request must be acceded to but that the court could and should consider the substance of the Correction Request to see if it fell within the scope of any of the three types of requests in Art 33 (set out at [42] above). In the present case, the only applicable request was the one for correcting an award. If the substance of the Correction Request fell within the scope of Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), it would not matter if in fact the tribunal were to dismiss the request, as in fact it did. The extension of time would still apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, in essence, what the Seller was suggesting was that the <span class="font-italic">form</span> of the Correction Request would suffice. Hence, so long as the Correction Request was said to be made under Art 33 and was seeking in terms a correction of the Award by the Tribunal, it would not matter even if in <span class="font-italic">substance</span> it was clearly not an Art 33 correction request. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 To the extent that <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum</span> decided that a request under Art 33 of the NZ 1996 Act need not be granted before the extension of time under Art 34(3) applies, we agree. This was also the holding of the Supreme Court of India in <span class="font-italic">Ved</span><span class="font-italic"> Prakash Mithal. </span>We are of the view that if the Correction Request was in substance an Art 33 correction request, the extension of time would apply even though the Correction Request was eventually dismissed. If, however, <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum</span> is to be construed as deciding that the <span class="font-italic">form</span> of such a request is sufficient to trigger an extension of time under Art 34(3), we would respectfully part company with it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The “strongest” argument in favour of the Seller’s submission appeared to be the Report of the Working Group as cited by the Judge at [49] of the GD (set out at [62] above). However, it is not clear to us what the reference to “dilatory tactics” means. For example, it could refer to a request which was genuinely in substance seeking a correction, but the correction to be made was immaterial to the conclusion of the tribunal. In that sense, such a request, while coming within the scope of Art 33, could be perceived as a dilatory tactic as it would be immaterial to the tribunal’s conclusions. Alternatively, the reference to “dilatory tactics” could also refer to a situation where quite clearly the substance of the request fails to meet any of the criteria in Art 33. The report did not mention an abuse of the process. It only referred to “dilatory tactics”. Hence, in our view, the report does not clearly assist us in determining the appropriate meaning to be attributed to the Phrase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 We are mindful that if we were to agree with the Claimants’ contention, there would be less certainty as only requests that are <span class="font-italic">in substance </span>Art 33 requests will qualify to extend time under Art 34(3) of the Model Law. There would also perhaps be more complexity if the party making the request under Art 33 also files a concurrent setting-aside application to court as a matter of caution in case its request is not considered in substance to be one coming within the scope of Art 33. We add, however, that it is not always the case that such a concurrent application to the court will have to be made with the making of the request to the tribunal. If the tribunal has decided on the request within the initial three-month time limit in Art 34(3), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, applying the date when the award is first received by the parties, then the applicant may still file its setting-aside application to court within that time limit. In other words, the three-month time limit that begins from the receipt of the tribunal’s award would not have expired if the tribunal had disposed of the request within that time limit. Hence, a concurrent application under Art 34 need not always be filed with the request under Art 33. If, however, the tribunal has not decided on the request under Art 33 within the initial time limit in Art 34(3), then the setting-aside application under Art 34 should be filed as a matter of caution before the expiry of the initial time limit.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Notwithstanding the arguments for certainty and simplicity, we are of the view that it is important to bear in mind that Art 33 is an exception to the initial time limit in Art 34(3). It delineates three types of requests which would in fact extend that time limit. In the case of an Art 33 correction request, the provision does not merely refer to a request to correct an error in an award. It goes on to elaborate that the error is to be “in computation, any clerical or typographical errors or any errors of similar nature” (Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 This is the equivalent of what is often referred to in court proceedings as the slip rule (see Sundaresh Menon et al, <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical</span> <span class="font-italic">Guide</span>, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed 2018, at paras 13.044–13.045). The Seller accepted in oral argument that that was likewise the purpose of Art 33 correction requests. It seems to us that it would be incongruous and an abuse of Arts 33 and 34 if a party could claim that its request for correction comes within the meaning of the Phrase so long as its terms state that it is made under the relevant provision in Art 33 and it seeks a correction of the award in question, even if in substance it is clearly nothing of the sort. That would defeat the purpose of specifying only three types of requests in Art 33 and render them otiose as effectively any request to the tribunal would suffice to extend time for making a setting-aside application to court so long as the request is drafted to follow the terms of the applicable provision(s) in Art 33.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Another illustration is useful. In <span class="font-italic">Opotiki</span>, the request was made to the tribunal for an interpretation of the award. However, the relevant provision in the NZ 1996 Act allowed such a request to be made only if it was agreed to by the parties, similar to the situation under Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Model Law. The request referred to the relevant provision in the NZ 1996 Act and stated the applicant’s request for various interpretations of the award without mentioning whether the parties had agreed on such a request. However, the court noted that in fact there was no agreement by the parties for such a request for interpretation to be made. If the Seller’s contention for the Phrase were upheld, it would suffice for a request to a tribunal to allude to the relevant provision for interpretation and say that the request had been agreed to when in fact that was not so. That cannot be right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Accordingly, we are of the view that the Phrase means that the substance of a request under Art 33 must come within the scope of the relevant provision in order that the request has the effect of extending the initial time limit under Art 34(3). Consequently, the court may consider the substance of the request to see if it comes within the scope of the relevant provision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the substance of the Correction Request came within the scope of Art 33(1)(a) of the Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In the present case, the Seller expressly stated in the Correction Request that it was “requesting the Tribunal to effect corrections in the Award”.

The matter proceeded to arbitration and in the final award, the arbitrator set out a final account in which he awarded US$35,330.85 to the ship-owners. This included a sum of US$21,858.33 for loadport demurrage. That was, however, an error as the parties had agreed to a figure of US$860 for loadport demurrage. On publication of the final award, this error was pointed out by the charterers and accepted by the ship-owners. The parties then disputed whether the arbitrator would award not only the principal amount in the award but also the award of costs arising from the error and made written submissions to the arbitrator. The arbitrator corrected his final award, reducing the award in favour of the ship-owners to US$15,119.96. The arbitrator also reduced the costs awarded to the ship-owners in view of the reduction of the principal amount.

In that case, the court was faced with the entirely different issue of whether the tribunal had the jurisdiction to make a consequential correction to the costs award after it had corrected and reduced the principal amount awarded to the owners under the slip rule. There was no dispute that the request for correction of the principal amount came within the relevant provision for correction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Buyer pointed out that a similar argument, namely, that the 4 July 2014 notice had been issued by the Buyer only and not the SPV, had been made before the Tribunal. Rejecting this argument, the Tribunal held at [70] of the Award that the Seller was in any case informed by notices, including the notice of 4 July 2014, of the SPV’s claims regarding the Cost Overrun and BPTA claims. The Buyer had also issued two Cost Overrun notices for the Seller’s payment of the Cost Overrun to the SPV. Such notices were issued with copies to the SPV and it could be inferred that they were issued by the Buyer on behalf of the SPV also.

</div> This was before the expiry of the three-month period that started when the Seller received the Award on 31 January 2018, and it was thus open to the Seller to file its setting-aside application by 30 April 2018. For reasons that were not provided to us, the Seller did not do so, and it instead elected to file its setting-aside application on 22 June 2018. While this did not influence our decision on this issue, we mention it to show that the Seller could have avoided any argument about the lateness of its application but decided, unwisely as it turned out, to file its application after 30 April 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 This suffices to dispose of the Seller’s setting-aside application.

In substance, this was a challenge against the Tribunal’s finding that the Project should have been wet commissioned by the Cut-off Date of 30 June 2014 had the Claimants acted in the most prudent and cost-effective manner. In the Tribunal’s view, the most prudent and cost- effective measure was for the Claimants to simply repair the penstock by patching and re-welding its cracked areas (the “Rewelding Method”). Instead of doing so, the Claimants decided to completely reline the penstock with a different grade of steel (the “Relining Method”). Had the Rewelding Method been adopted, the Project should have been completed by 30 June 2014. Instead, because of the Claimants’ decision to adopt the Relining Method, works on the penstock extended up to the middle of 2015, and this consequently delayed the wet commissioning of the Project.

Consideration of the pleaded issues is an essential feature of the rule of natural justice…”. Where it is contended that the tribunal “wholly missed one or more important pleaded issues”, “the inference … if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">clear and virtually inescapable</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Nonetheless, even if a rule of natural justice has been breached and the breach was connected to the making of the award, it is necessary to prove that the breach caused “actual or real prejudice” to the party seeking to set aside an award (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [86]). While this is “a lower hurdle than substantial prejudice, it certainly does not embrace technical or procedural irregularities that have caused no harm in the final analysis.” This means that “the breach of the rules of natural justice must, at the very least, have actually <span class="font-italic">altered the final </span><span class="font-italic">outcome of the arbitral proceedings </span>in some meaningful way” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Relining Method evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Returning to the setting-aside application, it is clear that <span class="font-italic">certain</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>evidence and arguments raised by the Claimants relating to the necessity of the Relining Method were not expressly mentioned in the Award.

</div> Nonetheless, the Tribunal focussed on other evidence which had been put forward by the <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">laimants</span>. In this regard, it placed emphasis on a report dated 30 December 2013 by Mr C (“Mr C”), the Vice-President of the <span class="font-italic">B</span><span class="font-italic">uyer</span> (“the C Report”). The C Report mentioned four repair options. The first was the Rewelding Method. This would require four months to execute. The Buyer itself initially proceeded with the Rewelding Method.

</div> In the Tribunal’s view, if the Claimants had acted in a reasonable, most prudent and cost-effective manner, it would have stuck to the Rewelding Method which would have been completed within three to four months from March 2014, which was when the Buyer formally took over control of the Project. Hence, the Seller ought not to be liable for any time-dependent component after 30 June 2014.

The question under examination is whether [the Buyer], having entered into the SPA subject to a requirement that wet commissioning should be achieved by executing the project with reference to the existing design at a particular price, can add additional safety features which were not in contemplation when the SPA was entered and indemnity was granted, even if such additional features were subsequently found to be necessary<span class="font-italic">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Even if relining was necessary</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, [the Seller’s] Cost Overrun indemnity will not cover the cost of relining or the interest and establishment expenditure incurred by [the SPV] during the extended period required for completion by reason of the relining of the penstock.</span> To put it differently, [the Buyer], having decided to acquire the project through share purchase route with a condition that [the Seller] should ensure completion of the [P]roject according to the then existing parameters/specifications/designs, cannot subsequently say that for safety purposes it would have other features and [the Buyer] should pay for the time spent for installing the additional features or the cost of the additional features.

</div>
</div> While this may be seen as an implicit consideration of the arguments and evidence in relation to the transmission line works, this finding must be seen in the appropriate context. When making such a finding, the Tribunal had already decided that the Seller was liable for Cost Overrun (which included costs incurred for transmission line works), and the only outstanding issue which it considered to be remaining relating to the transmission line works was the quantification of the costs of such works. Hence, at [264] of the Award, the Tribunal only considered the transmission line evidence in so far as was necessary to ascertain the <span class="font-italic">quantum </span>of such costs – in this relation, the Tribunal was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the Claimants’ claim for “[about S$8.3m] for transmission line cost”, and it therefore awarded that sum to the Claimants. This was, however, separate and distinct from the Claimants’ argument that the Project could not achieve wet commissioning until 31 October 2015 because, among others, there were delays in the transmission line which were caused by previously undetected design flaws. It is this latter set of arguments which the parties agree was <span class="font-italic">not </span>considered by the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In fact, the Judge also agreed that the Tribunal failed to consider such arguments (at [184]–[186] of the GD):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">184 The [C]laimants point to evidence showing that there were also defects in the transmission line … and that this would have delayed the [Wet Commissioning Date] far beyond 30 June 2014.

The transmission line is a component of the Project that must be complete and in place for wet commissioning. … <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">[T]ribunal, in finding that the Project would have been completed by 30 June 2014 if the [C]laimants had completed the Project in the most prudent and cost effective manner, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">did not address or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">analyse the delay caused by the rectification works being carried out on the transmission line</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Notwithstanding that finding, the Judge found that there was no breach of natural justice as “[a] possible explanation is that the [T]ribunal believed that in assessing the earliest time that the Project could be completed, if the claimant had employed the most prudent and cost effective method, any ongoing transmission line works (which were the obligation of the [parent company of the Seller]) were of no factual or legal relevance” (GD at [187]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 With respect, we find this to be speculative. As seen from the above, it is undisputed, as between the parties <span class="font-italic">and </span>the Judge, that the Tribunal simply failed to consider any arguments on this point, notwithstanding the pleadings by the claimants to this effect. In our view, this falls squarely within the factual scenario in <span class="font-italic">Front Row </span>and <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, where the respective tribunals had similarly failed entirely to consider an important pleaded issue raised by the parties. As explained in <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [45], it is not necessary in this relation that the tribunal also committed a mistake in failing to consider the relevant issue – “[t]he fact of the arbitrator’s mistake was irrelevant except to evince clearly that he had not considered the other pleaded representations at all.” Here, as in <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>, there is <span class="font-italic">no dispute </span>that the Tribunal failed to consider, whether explicitly or implicitly, the Claimants’ arguments relating to the transmission line defects being a separate cause of the delay in achieving wet commissioning. This suffices to amount to a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 This breach of natural justice caused real and actual prejudice to the Claimants. The Tribunal limited the Claimants’ entitlement to indemnity for certain components as at 30 June 2014 because it considered that, if the Claimants had acted in a reasonable, most prudent and cost-effective manner, “the Project would have been completed within three to four months from 1 February 2014 … This means, that [the Seller] is liable to bear the cost overrun components which were dependent on the time factor … only till 30 June 2014”.

If the Cut-off Date were to be revised, this would only affect the quantum of indemnity payable by the Seller to the Claimants, which could be effected without upending the entire Award. Accordingly, pursuant to Art 34(4) of the Model Law, we remit the issue of whether the transmission line delays would have affected the Cut-off Date of 30 June 2014 to the Tribunal for its consideration.

</div> In that case, the English Court of Appeal was concerned with an arbitral award pertaining to a contract for the sale of wheat. The sellers had contracted to deliver 200 tonnes of wheat to the buyer, but only 100 tonnes of wheat was delivered. During the arbitration, the sellers sought payment for the delivery of the 100 tonnes of wheat that had been delivered, while the buyer argued that he had a cross-claim in respect of the other 100 tonnes which had not been delivered. In its award, the tribunal ordered the buyer to pay the sellers £2,775 with interest for the first 100 tonnes of wheat that had been delivered. The tribunal also allowed the cross-claim, and ordered the sellers to pay the buyer the sum of £2,859.64, this being the difference between the contractual purchase price and the actual price paid by the buyer to make up for the 100 tonnes of undelivered wheat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The buyer accepted the entirety of the award, and paid the sellers the sum of £2,775 with interest. The sellers accepted the payment, but took exception with the second part of the award which held that they were liable for the cross-claim. They then applied to set aside the tribunal’s award on the basis that one of the arbitrators who had to go to Australia, had signed a blank form of award before he left and before all the submissions were made. He left it to the other arbitrators to fill in the award. The English Court of Appeal accepted that it was misconduct on the part of the arbitrator to sign the award form in blank without taking part in the decision-making process and for the other arbitrators to endorse his action. The whole award was thereby defective (at 245). Nonetheless, since the sellers had taken the benefit of the award (by accepting the buyer’s payment in full), they were not entitled to have it set aside. Doing so would amount to approbating the award by claiming the benefit thereunder, before reprobating it by saying that it was wrong and ought to be substituted with another award (at 245–246). Lord Denning MR said at 245:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It seems to me quite impossible for them to say, “Oh, well; we like that part of the award but we do not like the other part where we were ordered to pay damages. We do not like that and therefore we want it set aside.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That certainly cannot be done. The principle was stated long ago in <span class="font-italic">Dexters</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd </span>v <span class="font-italic">Hill Crest Oil Co (Bradford) Ltd </span>[1926] 1 KB 348 where Scrutton LJ said that a person could not reap the fruits of an award – because that infers that the award was right – and afterwards say that the award was wrong. He said, at p 358:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That is the same thing as saying first: ‘I approbate this award and claim a benefit, £2,000, under it; pay me that £2,000’; and then when he has got it, saying: ‘I reprobate this award and say it is wrong and ask you to substitute another award …’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 At 247, Kerr LJ also said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The sellers have taken the benefit of this award—they have taken the benefit of that part of it which they like—and they cannot possibly now come to the court and ask the court to set the award aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 This is however not the situation before us. As we explained in <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1296 at [118], the doctrine of approbation and reprobation applies when “the parties who sought to advance inconsistent positions had already secured actual benefits from their prior positions”. The Claimants cannot be said to be approbating and reprobating because there is nothing inconsistent about enforcing the Award in its present form on the one hand and seeking to claim <span class="font-italic">more </span>by challenging another part of the Award on the other hand. In so doing, they are simply accepting the full benefits of the Award and looking to expand upon it. Indeed, if the Seller were correct, it would mean that a party who is awarded relief by a tribunal cannot commence action in a court to enforce that part of the award granting it relief if it is also seeking to claim more by challenging another part of the award, until its challenge is finally determined by the court or the tribunal. In our view, that cannot be right.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Civil Appeal No 34 of 2019 as the Seller’s setting-aside application is time-barred. We allow Civil Appeal No 35 of 2019 in part and remit the issue of whether the transmission line delays would have postponed the Cut-off Date to the Tribunal for its decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Costs follow the event, and we award costs of the two appeals in favour of the Claimants fixed at $90,000 inclusive of disbursements. The usual consequential orders apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 We vary the costs order below and grant the Claimants the costs of both applications fixed at $60,000 inclusive of disbursements.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"><br/>Judith Prakash     Steven Chong Woo Bih Li <br/>Judge of Appeal     Judge of Appeal Judge <br/><br/></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nakul Dewan <span class="font-italic">SA</span> (instructed), Lin Weiqi Wendy, Goh Wei Wei and Teh Zi Ling, Stephanie (WongPartnership LLP) (instructing) for the appellant in Civil Appeal No 34 of 2019 and the respondent in Civil Appeal No 35 of 2019;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Dhillon Dinesh Singh, Toh Jia Yi and Chee Yi Wen, Serene (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the respondents in Civil Appeal No 34 of 2019 and the appellants in Civil Appeal No 35 of 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
