The applicant also sought leave to apply for declarations that SUM 3816 is in breach of Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (the “Constitution”). However, as pointed out by the AG, procedurally, the applicant should have obtained leave to apply for the prohibiting order before including the prayers for declaratory relief in the subsequent summons: O 53 rr 1(1) and 2(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”).

In this regard, the applicant raised two grounds in support for his position (as mentioned at [11] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the AG’s decision to prosecute him for contempt of court is “both unlawful and irrational”; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the AG’s decision to prosecute him for contempt is in breach of the applicant’s right to equal protection under the law pursuant to Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As reiterated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Attorney-General </span>[2021] 1 SLR 809 (“<span class="font-italic">Syed </span><span class="font-italic">Suhail</span>”) at [9], for an applicant to obtain leave to commence judicial review proceedings, three conditions are to be met:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the subject matter of the complaint has to be susceptible to judicial review;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the applicant must have sufficient interest in the subject matter; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the material before the court must disclose an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Before me, there were no contentions in relation to the first two conditions. The dispute concerned the third condition only. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Article 35(8) of the Constitution vests prosecutorial power on the AG. In view of the constitutional office, when the AG initiates a prosecution against an offender, there is a presumption that the AG does so in accordance with the law. In other words, the court should presume that the AG’s prosecutorial decisions are constitutional or lawful until they are shown to be otherwise: <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span><span class="font-italic">Ravinthran v Attorney-General </span>[2012] 2 SLR 49 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>”) at [44].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In respect of both grounds, the applicant asserted that in exercising his prosecutorial power and discretion under Art 35(8) of the Constitution, the AG has treated the applicant differently from Ms O’Connor without basis. For completeness, Art 12(1) of the Constitution states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Equal protection</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">12.</span>—(1)  All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Daniel De Costa Augustin v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 5 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">Daniel De </span><span class="font-italic">Costa”</span>) at [54]–[55], the High Court summarised the principles concerning the interpretation and effect of Art 12(1) in relation to prosecutorial discretion as laid out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>thus: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span> embarked on a detailed and comprehensive consideration of the law pertaining to the constitutional ambits of prosecutorial discretion under Art 12(1). … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">After the lengthy discussion, the Court of Appeal established that: all things being equal, like cases must be treated alike with respect to all offenders involved in the same criminal conduct (at [24], [51]); there must be no bias on the Prosecution’s part and irrelevant considerations must not be taken into account (at [51]); the Prosecution is entitled to take into account many factors in its exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and where the factors apply differently to different offenders, it may justify different treatment between them (at [24], [52]); the burden of proof lies on the offender to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> breach of prosecutorial discretion (at [70]–[72]); and if such <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> breach is proven, the Prosecution must justify its prosecutorial decision to the court (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I emphasise that where there is an allegation of breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution by the AG, unless the applicant produces <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence of reasonable suspicion of breach, the AG need not justify his prosecutorial decision. To discharge his evidential burden, an applicant may adduce evidence that he could be considered equally situated with another person. At this first stage, the court engages in an assessment of whether the persons in question could be said to be equally situated such that any differential treatment required justification. If so discharged, the evidential burden is shifted to the AG to provide justification for treating them differently. At this second stage, the court considers the question of whether the differential treatment was reasonable – meaning whether it was based on “legitimate” reasons which made differential treatment “proper”: <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail </span>at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 At this juncture, I digress briefly to address the applicant’s submission that the AG did not even provide any evidence by way of affidavit to justify his prosecutorial discretion to the court. Instead, there were only two affidavits by ASP Tan. However, ASP Tan was not in the position to explain the reasons for the AG’s exercise of the prosecutorial discretion.

</div>
</div> In response, the AG stated that the applicant had not even discharged his evidential burden to show that Ms O’Connor could be said to be equally situated such that any differential treatment required justification. At this stage, it was only necessary for the AG to show that such relevant differences or distinguishing factors exist “by way of illustration”: <span class="font-italic">Daniel De Costa </span>at [82]–[84]. This was the purpose for reliance on ASP Tan’s affidavits. On this point, I accepted the AG’s position that ASP Tan’s affidavits were meant to engage with this first stage inquiry, and not to provide the actual justification for the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To round off, the applicant also contended that SUM 3816 is illegal and/or irrational based on the AG treating him differently from Ms O’Connor. In considering the legality of a decision, the court examines whether a decision-maker “has exercised his discretion in good faith according to the statutory purpose for which the power was granted, and whether he has taken into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take account of relevant considerations”. In examining the rationality of a decision, the court “seeks to ascertain the range of legally possible answers and asks if the decision made is one which, though falling within that range, is so absurd that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to it” [emphasis in original omitted]: <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Seet Eng v Attorney-General and another matter </span>[2016] 1 SLR 779 at [80]. Again, it was for the applicant to show <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence in support of such contentions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As stated above, the crux of the applicant’s case was that the AG has treated him differently from Ms O’Connor without any basis. Therefore, for convenience, I begin with the second ground (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the AG’s decision to prosecute him for contempt is in breach of the applicant’s right to equal protection under the law pursuant to Art 12(1) of the Constitution).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> evidence of a breach of Article 12(1) of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Constitution shown </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having considered the submissions, I was of the view that the applicant had not shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As observed in <span class="font-italic">Daniel </span><span class="font-italic">De Costa</span> at [83], the fact that one offender faces prosecution, while others who may have committed similar actions do not, does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>indicate breach of Art 12(1) or the improper exercise of discretion. Differentiation between offenders (even of equal guilt), can be legitimately taken for many reasons and based on the consideration of many factors. It is for the offender who complains of a breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution to prove that there are <span class="font-italic">no </span>valid grounds for such differentiation. In the absence of such proof by the offender, the court should not presume that there are no valid grounds in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It is important, as in any case where an applicant alleges a breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution, to be clear of the relevant comparator. As the applicant pointed out, the relevant comparator was Ms O’Connor. In my judgment, it was both erroneous and irrelevant to analogise Ms O’Connor to other cases concerning Mr Li or other Malaysian entities such as MalaysiaNow and Lawyers for Liberty as the applicant contended (see [12(e)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I considered whether the applicant is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>equally situated with Ms O’Connor. In my judgment, this had to be answered in the negative. In this regard, I accepted the AG’s arguments that <span class="font-italic">by way of illustration</span>, there were at least three material differences between the applicant and Ms O’Connor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, the difference in the <span class="font-italic">degree of any harm caused</span>. As the AG pointed out, TOC, founded in 2006, is a well-known alternative news platform in Singapore with a substantial audience and reach. Apart from the applicant, TOC had a team of writers and reporters to “provide readers with alternative perspectives and to cover stories ignored or under-reported by traditional media” in Singapore.

</div> it appeared that Ms O’Connor was aggrieved by what she perceived to be a fraudulent conspiracy against her involving various Singapore corporate entities and institutions. Certainly, Ms O’Connor did not hold herself out to be an independent journalist. While she may have written and published the Letter based on her personal belief in her allegations, the applicant, as a journalist and editor by profession could be expected to exercise a higher degree of judgment and circumspection in determining what to publish.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third, the difference in <span class="font-italic">ease of investigations, </span><span class="font-italic">prosecution and enforcement</span>. Ms O’Connor resides in Australia. Even if Ms O’Connor accepted full responsibility for the authorship and publication of the Letter on BOTT, and was open to questioning by the authorities, it could not be seriously challenged that her residence overseas would pose some difficulties in investigations, prosecution and enforcement for the authorities. In this connection, the applicant’s reliance on three other cases – involving Mr Li, MalaysiaNow and Lawyers for Liberty (as mentioned at [29] above) – did not buttress his case. It was not disputed that the AG could prosecute person residing overseas for contempt of court. However, this did not mean that the fact that Ms O’Connor resides overseas was not a differentiating factor between the applicant and Ms O’Connor. It also did not follow that the AG must prosecute all persons residing overseas along with the offenders who reside locally, or else be in breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Certainly,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“[i]t is not the policy of the law under our legal system that all offenders must be prosecuted, regardless of the circumstances in which they have committed offences”: <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>at [53]. Also “[i]t is not necessarily in the public interest that every offender must be prosecuted”. In addition to legal guilt, the AG is obliged to consider the offender’s “moral blameworthiness, the gravity of harm caused to the public welfare by his criminal activity, and a myriad of other factors”: <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>at [63]. The differentiating factors which were put forth <span class="font-italic">for illustrative purposes only</span> – especially of harm and culpability in respect of the applicant and Ms O’Connor – were legitimate considerations for the AG. As such, I found that applicant had not discharged his burden to adduce evidence of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I acknowledged that there was some evidence for the applicant’s position that Ms O’Connor has accepted “full responsibility” for the contents of the Letter which she wrote and published on BOTT. However, Ms O’Connor’s admission of responsibility for the authorship of the Letter did not in any way undermine the fact that there were these differentiating factors as mentioned between the applicant and Ms O’Connor. Further, it seemed to me that Ms O’Connor’s action did not absolve the applicant of his responsibility, <span class="font-italic">if any</span>, for the publication of the Article and the Facebook Post as the Chief Editor of TOC. That, of course, would be a matter for another day in SUM 3816.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> evidence of illegality or irrationality </span><span class="font-weight-bold">shown</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Applicant’s claims of illegality and irrationality were premised on the same matters discussed above.
