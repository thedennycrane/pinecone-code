        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action arose out of the rupture of a water
                    inlet hose which carried water to a water dispensing unit (“the
                    WDU”) installed at the office of Liquid Advertising Pte Ltd (“the
                    first defendant”). The WDU was installed and maintained by Goh Sin Huat
                    Electrical Pte Ltd (“the second defendant”). The water which
                    leaked from the ruptured water inlet hose seeped into an art gallery called
                    Xuanhua Art Gallery (“the Art Gallery”) located below the first
                    defendant’s office. The art gallery was owned and operated by Ho See Jui
                    (“the plaintiff”). The water seepage resulted in damage to the
                    plaintiff’s paintings which were painted on rice paper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is in the business of exhibiting
                    and selling contemporary Chinese ink paintings which are traditionally painted
                    on rice paper. He is the tenant of the ground floor of a two-storey shophouse
                    located at 70 Bussorah Street, Singapore 199483. He displayed his paintings at
                    the Art Gallery and also stored some paintings in a cabinet located at the back
                    of the Art Gallery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant was at all material times
                    the tenant of 70A Bussorah Street (“the Second Floor Unit”) which
                    is located directly above the Art Gallery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The second defendant is the sole local
                    distributor of the “Frigeria” brand of WDUs. Additionally, the
                    second defendant also repairs and maintains the same brand of water dispensing
                    units. The second defendant sold the first defendant the
                    “Frigeria” brand WDU that is the subject of this claim, on or
                    about 2 April 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The installation of the WDU at the Second Floor Unit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second defendant had initially installed (in
                    April 2001) the WDU at the first defendant’s previous office located at
                    770A North Bridge Road, Singapore 198738. When the first defendant moved to
                    the Second Floor Unit, it entered into an agreement with the second defendant
                    for the latter to reinstall the WDU at the Second Floor Unit (“the
                    Reinstallation Agreement”). A quotation issued for the installation
                    (“the Quotation”) contained the following clause (“the
                    Quotation Warning”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">** PLS [<em>sic</em>] NOTE: THE PLACE WHERE THE WATER
                        DISPENSER IS INSTALLED SHOULD HAVE A FLOOR TRAP, SO THAT WHEN THERE IS A
                        LEAK IT WILL NOT FLOOD THE AREA. WE WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
                        DAMAGES [<em>sic</em>] RESULTING FROM THE LEAKING
                            [<em>sic</em>] OR FLOODING FROM THE FILER
                            [<em>sic</em>] OR WATER DISPENSER.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The second defendant reinstalled the WDU at the
                    Second Floor Unit on 2 September 2004. (Hereinafter, the area where the WDU
                    was installed will be referred to as the “WDU Area”). It was not
                    disputed that the WDU Area had timber flooring which could allow water to pass
                    through its cracks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The maintenance of the WDU</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first defendant entered into service and
                    maintenance contracts with the second defendant in August 2001 (“the
                    First Maintenance Contract”), on 11 December 2003 (“the
                    Second Maintenance Contract”) and on 22 June 2005 (“the Third
                    Maintenance Contract”) (collectively, “the Maintenance
                    Contracts”). The second defendant’s service director, however,
                    asserted during cross-examination that the parties only had one maintenance
                    contract which was renewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Third Maintenance Contract (which duration
                    was from 22 June 2005 to 21 June 2007) stated that the WDU was to be
                    serviced a total of eight times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Second Maintenance Contract and the Third
                    Maintenance Contract though not the First Maintenance Contract, contained the
                    following clause (“the Disclaimer”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DEAR CUSTOMER,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THE INSTALLATION OF THE WATER COOLER AND/OR WATER
                        DISPENSER SHOULD BE AT A WET PANTRY AREA. GOH SIN HUAT ELECTRICAL PTE LTD
                        WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES [<em>sic</em>] RESULTING FROM FLOODING OR LEAKING FROM THE WATER
                        FILTER AND/OR WATER COOLER AND/OR WATER DISPENSER OR ANY DAMAGES [<em>sic</em>] FROM THE INSTALLATION OR REPAIR OR FAULT OF THE
                        WATER COOLER AND/OR WATER DISPENSER.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Disclaimer was also inserted in the second
                    defendant’s service orders which were issued for services carried out
                    under the Maintenance Contracts, and in the service order issued for the
                    reinstallation of the WDU at the Second Floor Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The rupturing of the Water Inlet Hose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It was common ground that the water inlet hose
                    (“the Water Inlet Hose”) carrying water to the WDU ruptured
                    sometime in the evening of 24 September 2008 and the early morning of
                    25 September 2008. The water that leaked from the Water Inlet Hose seeped
                    through the flooring of the Second Floor Unit into the Art Gallery. The
                    plaintiff alleged that the water that seeped into the Art Gallery damaged his
                    paintings and the cabinet storing his paintings – this damage formed the
                    basis of his action against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff raised three causes of action
                    against the first defendant in his claim for general and special damages. First,
                    that the first defendant was negligent in: (a) installing the WDU at the
                    WDU Area; (b) failing to relocate the WDU to a wet pantry area or a place
                    with drainage; and (c) failing to ensure that the WDU and/or the Water
                    Inlet Hose were properly maintained. Second, that the first defendant created a
                    nuisance by installing the WDU in an inappropriate location. Third, that the
                    installation of the WDU at the WDU Area was a non-natural or special use that
                    increased the danger to the plaintiff and/or the Art Gallery; the
                    plaintiff’s claim in this regard was based on the rule in <em>John Rylands and Jehu Horrocks v Thomas Fletcher</em>
                    (1868) LR 3 HL 330 (“<em>Rylands v
                        Fletcher</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As against the second defendant, the plaintiff
                    pleaded two causes of action. First, that the second defendant was negligent for
                    broadly the same reasons raised vis-à-vis the first defendant. In addition, the
                    plaintiff alleged that the second defendant was negligent in:
                    (a) installing the Water Inlet Hose which was inherently unsuitable for the
                    carriage of potable water and/or for use with the WDU and (b) providing
                    and/or installing the Water Inlet Hose without ascertaining whether the Water
                    Inlet Hose was suitable for use with the WDU. Second, as with his claim against
                    the first defendant, the plaintiff alleged that the second defendant created a
                    nuisance by installing the WDU at an inappropriate location.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The first defendant’s defence was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first defendant did not know and
                        could not have been expected to know that: (i) it was dangerous to the
                        Art Gallery to install and ordinarily use the WDU; and (ii) the
                        installation of the WDU at the WDU Area was inappropriate. The first
                        defendant provided extensive particulars why it could not have known these
                        two facts – it explained that it had appointed the second defendant, a
                        competent independent contractor, to install and maintain the WDU and its
                        piping and it also took reasonable steps to ensure that the WDU would be
                        properly installed and maintained. (It appeared from the first
                        defendant’s opening statement and closing submissions that its
                        averments on its knowledge related to the plaintiff’s claim in
                        nuisance). The first defendant asserted that an employer would only be
                        responsible for the nuisance created by an independent contractor if it
                        could reasonably foresee that the work it instructed the independent
                        contractor to do was likely to result in a nuisance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     The first defendant did not admit that
                        it owed the plaintiff a duty of care. In the alternative, the first
                        defendant claimed that it discharged its duty of care by appointing a
                        competent independent contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     As for the plaintiff’s claim based on the rule in
                            <em>Rylands v Fletcher</em>, the first defendant
                        averred that the use, installation and maintenance of the WDU at the WDU
                        Area were natural uses of the Second Floor Unit. The first defendant also
                        averred that any non-natural use was due to an independent act of a third
                        party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second defendant denied that it owed a
                    duty of care to the plaintiff or that it breached that duty for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The second defendant did not know
                        that the carpeted flooring at the WDU Area was made of timber and that the
                        WDU Area was located directly above the plaintiff’s cabinet containing
                        some of the plaintiff’s paintings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second defendant was not responsible for the
                        location where the WDU was installed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The second defendant did not install the Water Inlet
                        Hose. The second defendant also averred that the Water Inlet Hose appeared
                        to be deliberately cut.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The second defendant denied the
                    plaintiff’s nuisance claim for broadly the same reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The first defendant served a notice of
                    contribution or indemnity against the second defendant for the plaintiff‘s
                    claim. The first defendant claimed that it was entitled to an indemnity or
                    contribution because the second defendant had breached various implied terms of
                    the Reinstallation Agreement and the Maintenance Contracts in two respects.
                    First, it provided the Water Inlet Hose which was of an unsatisfactory quality
                    and/or was not reasonably fit for its intended purpose. Second, the second
                    defendant did not perform its obligations under the Reinstallation Agreement and
                    the Maintenance Contracts with reasonable care and skill, or at
                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The main points that the second defendant
                    raised in response to the first defendant’s claim for an indemnity or
                    contribution were as follows. First, the Maintenance Contracts expired before
                    24 September 2008. Second, under the terms of the Third Maintenance
                    Agreement, the second defendant did not take responsibility for the location of
                    the WDU. Further, the second defendant’s duties only concerned the WDU
                    itself and not the Water Inlet Hose. Third, the terms that the first defendant
                    claimed were implied into the Reinstallation Agreement and the Third Maintenance
                    Agreement were not so implied because the Water Inlet Hose was not installed by
                    the second defendant. Fourth, in the alternative, the second defendant was
                    entitled to rely on the Quotation Warning and the Disclaimer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The trial before this court only concerned the
                    issue of liability of the defendants because the court below had made an order
                    for bifurcation of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The factual disputes for determination were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     What caused the Water Inlet Hose to
                        rupture and was the Water Inlet Hose suitable for carrying
                    water?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was the
                        Water Inlet Hose suitable for use with the WDU?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Were the features which caused the rupturing of
                        the Water Inlet Hose discoverable on a reasonable
                    inspection?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Did the
                        second defendant install the Water Inlet Hose?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The following were the legal issues to be
                    considered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s claim against
                        the first defendant in the tort of negligence <em>viz</em>, the duty of care and breach of duty. I therefore have
                        to consider only the following two issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       Did the first defendant owe
                            the plaintiff a duty of care to ensure that the Art Gallery would not be
                            damaged from a leakage of water from the WDU?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       If so, did the first
                            defendant breach that duty?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did the first defendant create or maintain a nuisance by
                        locating the WDU at the WDU Area?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     With regard to the plaintiff’s claim against the
                        first defendant under the rule in <em>Rylands v
                            Fletcher</em>, was the first defendant’s location of the WDU
                        at the WDU Area a non-natural use of its premises?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     In relation to the plaintiff’s
                        claim against the second defendant in the tort of negligence, the parties
                        had also only contested the elements of duty of care and breach of duty.
                        Therefore, the same two issues should be considered:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       Did the second defendant
                            owe the plaintiff a duty of care?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       If so, did the second defendant breach that
                            duty?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     Did the second defendant create or maintain a nuisance by locating
                        the WDU at the WDU Area?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_f"></a>(f)     Depending on this court’s findings, a further issue
                        to be decided would be whether there is a need to apportion liability
                        between the two defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_g"></a>(g)     Further, if the first defendant is liable to the
                        plaintiff, it would be necessary to consider whether the first defendant is
                        entitled to an indemnity from the second defendant. In this regard, the
                        following subsidiary issues will have to be addressed:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_g-p3_i"></a>(i)       Did the second defendant
                            breach the Reinstallation Agreement and/or the Maintenance
                            Contracts?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_g-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       If so, would the Quotation Warning and/or the Disclaimer
                            exculpate the second defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What caused the Water Inlet Hose to rupture and was the Water Inlet
                Hose suitable to carry water?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff and the defendants called expert
                    witnesses to testify on first, the cause of the failure of the Water Inlet Hose
                    and second, whether the Water Inlet Hose was suitable to carry water. For
                    convenience, both issues will be dealt with together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff’s witness was one Liam Kok
                    Chye (“Liam”). Liam is a senior consultant with Matcor Technology
                    &amp; Services Pte Ltd. Liam testified that he has had more than 20 years of
                    consulting experience in materials and corrosion engineering in various
                    industries. Importantly, his experience included failure and material analysis
                    of polymers and plastics.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Liam’s evidence was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Water Inlet Hose had a
                        pre-existing fabrication defect in the form of two helical seam lines
                        (“the Helical Line Feature”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Water Inlet Hose was unsuitable for use with
                        a WDU because it was made of ester-based polyurethane. Liam concluded that
                        the Water Inlet Hose was made of ester-based polyurethane after conducting a
                        Fourier Transform Infrared (“FTIR”) analysis of a similar hose
                        purchased from Pneumax, the manufacturers of the Water Inlet
                    Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Ester-based
                        polyurethane is susceptible to degradation when it is exposed to water. This
                        process of degradation is known as
                    “hydrolysis”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     Ester-based polyurethane tubes are not suitable for use
                        in potable water systems. Liam referred to the Singapore Standard Code of
                        Practice No 48 titled “Code of Practice for Water Services”
                        (“SSCP No 48”). According to Liam, SSCP No 48 sets out
                        industry practices and standards in Singapore for the use of tubes and pipes
                        for the carriage of water. Liam referred to the following paragraphs of SSCP
                        No 48 in his report:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.2    Choice of materials for piping</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.2.1 In choosing the material for the piping and
                            fittings, account shall be taken of the character of the water to be
                            conveyed and of the nature of any ground in which the piping is to be
                            laid. <em>The material shall be non-corrodible or
                                resistant to corrosion</em> both <em>inside</em> and outside, shall be suitably protected against
                            corrosion and shall not impart any taste or toxicity on the water
                            conveyed. All pipes and fittings shall comply with the requirements and
                            standards stipulated by the Authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.2.6 Plastic pipes include unplasticized polyvinyl
                            chloride, polybutylene, polypropylene or polyethylene. Suppliers are to
                            be consulted on the suitability of their use with hot
                        water.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since ester-based polyurethane is susceptible to degradation by
                        hydrolysis, it was not suitable for the carriage of potable water on the
                        basis of SSCP No 48.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     Liam’s view was that the Water
                        Inlet Hose ruptured because of hydrolysis and the Helical Line
                        Feature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The first defendant’s witness was Graham
                    Alan Cooper (“Cooper”). Cooper is an associate with the Singapore
                    office of Dr J H Burgoyne &amp; Partners (International) Ltd. Cooper has worked
                    as a materials scientist specialising in failure analysis and failure
                    investigation for more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Cooper’s evidence was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Helical Line Feature was
                        probably the result of the usual process used to manufacture hoses such as
                        the Water Inlet Hose. Consequently, the Helical Line Feature was not really
                        a defect. It is better described as a feature of the Water Inlet
                        Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        likely cause of the rupturing of the Water Inlet Hose was a chemical attack
                        from the water flowing through it. The Water Inlet Hose was made of
                        ester-based polyurethane which is susceptible to hydrolysis. Ester-based
                        polyurethane has good resistance to oils but relatively poor resistance to
                        water.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Water Inlet Hose was therefore not suitable for carrying
                    water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Cooper confirmed during cross-examination that
                    he agreed with Liam’s findings, apart from a “very slight
                    difference of emphasis”. This difference in emphasis was that in
                    Cooper’s opinion the Helical Line Feature was an inherent feature of the
                    Water Inlet Hose. The Water Inlet Hose was designed to transport compressed air.
                    If the Water Inlet Hose had been used for its intended purpose, the Helical Line
                    Feature would not have presented any problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second defendant’s witness was Cheng
                    Shao Hing (“Cheng”) who is an engineering consultant with Camden
                    Engineering Associates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Cheng’s evidence was that the rupture on
                    the Water Inlet Hose appeared to be a clean cut. According to Cheng, the Water
                    Inlet Hose could have ruptured due to a cut from a sharp instrument with both
                    ends of the Water Inlet Hose firmly held down. During cross-examination, Cheng
                    clarified that he was only drawing a “possible conclusion” as to
                    the cause of the failure of the Water Inlet Hose. He agreed that the Water Inlet
                    Hose could have failed because of other causes. Cheng did not draw any
                    conclusions in his expert report as to whether the Water Inlet Hose was suitable
                    to carry water. However, Cheng referred to a hydrostatic pressure test done by
                    Setsco Services Pte Ltd (“Setsco”) on a hose of the same type as
                    the Water Inlet Hose that the second defendant had commissioned. The hose was
                    able to withstand a hydrostatic pressure of four bars per hour. Cheng clarified
                    during cross-examination that the reason for his reference to Setsco’s
                    test was that it showed that the Water Inlet Hose could be used for the carriage
                    of water under pressure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Both Cooper and Liam disagreed with
                    Cheng’s evidence that the Water Inlet Hose could have been ruptured due to
                    a cut.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Liam provided four reasons why the cause of
                    failure could not have been a cut. First, the rupture on the Water Inlet Hose
                    was straight. It would be difficult to make a straight cut on a plastic tube.
                    Second, the rupture on the Water Inlet Hose was <em>directly
                        along</em> the Helical Line Feature which was inclined at
                    approximately 12 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the Water Inlet Hose. In
                    Liam’s view, it was practically impossible for a cut to coincidentally run
                    along such a helical seam line. Third, a close-up view of the ruptured portion
                    of the Water Inlet Hose showed that the rupture occurred along two distinct
                    regions. One region had a greyish colour and the other region was slightly
                    darker. Liam’s opinion was that if the Water Inlet Hose were cut, the
                    rupture would have had a consistent appearance. Fourth, in Liam’s opinion,
                    an examination of the rupture showed that it was made from the inside out.
                    Needless to say, it would be nearly impossible to make a cut in the middle of a
                    hose from the inside out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Cooper provided three reasons for his
                    disagreement with Cheng’s evidence. First, the Water Inlet Hose ruptured
                    from the inside out. Second, Cooper agreed with Liam that it would be
                    inconceivable for a cut to have been made precisely along the Helical Line
                    Feature. Third, a close examination of the fracture surface of the Water Inlet
                    Hose showed that the Water Inlet Hose was not cut. If the Water Inlet Hose was
                    cut with a sharp knife, the fracture surface would appear as a clean cut with
                    striations due to the fine serrations on the knife blade.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff submitted that Cheng’s
                    evidence should be disregarded entirely because Cheng conceded that failure
                    analysis was not his area of speciality. The plaintiff also highlighted that
                    Cheng admitted that his testimony was simply that a cut was a possible cause of
                    the failure of the Water Inlet Hose. He did not provide a definitive opinion
                    that the Water Inlet Hose was in fact cut. The plaintiff further submitted that
                    the Water Inlet Hose was not suitable to carry water because it was made of a
                    material that would tend to break down when exposed to water. The plaintiff
                    referred to the expert testimony of Liam and Cooper and SSCP No 48 to support
                    his submission. The first defendant’s submissions were broadly similar to
                    the plaintiff’s submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second defendant did not refer to
                    Cheng’s evidence in its closing submissions. The focus of the second
                    defendant’s closing submissions was that the Water Inlet Hose was not
                    installed by the second defendant. This argument is explored below (see
                        <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>–<a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The finding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I accept the opinion of Liam and Cooper that
                    the Water Inlet Hose ruptured due to hydrolysis. I note that Liam’s
                    opinion was that another cause of the rupturing of the Water Inlet Hose was the
                    Helical Line Feature. I accept his opinion that the Helical Line Feature
                    contributed to the rupturing of the Water Inlet Hose. However, I should add that
                    I agree with Cooper’s opinion that the Helical Line Feature is not a
                    defect <em>per se</em>. The Helical Line Feature was an
                    inherent feature of the Water Inlet Hose. The Helical Line Feature would not
                    have had any impact on the use of the Water Inlet Hose if it had been used for
                    its intended purpose of carrying compressed air. Therefore, my finding is that
                    the Water Inlet Hose ruptured due to a combination of two factors:
                    (a) hydrolysis; and (b) the Helical Line Feature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I prefer the opinions of Liam and Cooper on
                    the cause of the failure of the Water Inlet Hose over Cheng’s opinion
                    because the former’s opinions were well reasoned. Both witnesses referred
                    to scientific literature to support their opinion that ester-based polyurethane
                    was prone to degradation by hydrolysis. Indeed, Cheng conceded during
                    cross-examination that ester-based polyurethane is prone to degradation by
                    hydrolysis. Liam and Cooper also provided illustrations of the degradation of
                    the Water Inlet Hose. They produced close-up photographs of the Water Inlet Hose
                    under strong light. Those photographs showed cracks in the Water Inlet Hose.
                    They were also able to rebut Cheng’s postulation that the rupture could
                    have been due to a cut with convincing reasons (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>). In
                    contrast, I find Cheng’s evidence to be unreliable for two reasons. First,
                    Cheng was not an expert in the area of failure analysis. Both Liam and Cooper
                    testified that a person with general engineering experience like Cheng would not
                    have the expertise to investigate and opine on the reason why the Water Inlet
                    Hose failed. In fact, Cheng conceded during cross-examination that failure
                    analysis was not his area of expertise. Second, Cheng did not provide a
                    conclusive opinion on the cause of the failure of the Water Inlet Hose. Cheng
                    clarified during cross-examination that he was merely suggesting that a cut was
                    a possible cause of the failure of the Water Inlet Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Turning to the suitability of the Water Inlet
                    Hose for the carriage of water, I also accept the opinions of Liam and Cooper
                    that the Water Inlet Hose was not suitable. It was Liam’s undisputed
                    evidence that the SSCP No 48 provides the industry standard for the types of
                    hoses that should be used to carry potable water. It was also undisputed that
                    ester-based polyurethane, the material from which the Water Inlet Hose was made,
                    is prone to degradation when exposed to water. It follows therefore that the
                    Water Inlet Hose was unsuitable for the carriage of water on the basis of the
                    standard prescribed in SSCP No 48.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I prefer the opinions of Liam and Cooper on
                    the suitability of the Water Inlet Hose because, again, their views were well
                    reasoned. Liam’s testimony, in particular, was useful because of his
                    reference to an industry standard. Cheng’s report, on the other hand, did
                    not provide a conclusive opinion on the suitability of the Water Inlet Hose. It
                    was only in cross-examination that Cheng clarified that the reason for his
                    reference to Setsco’s test was to show that a hose of the same make as the
                    Water Inlet Hose could withstand a certain hydrostatic pressure. Setsco’s
                    test was however ultimately irrelevant because it did not contradict the fact
                    that ester-based polyurethane is susceptible to hydrolytic
                degradation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the features which caused the rupturing of the Water Inlet Hose
                discoverable on a reasonable inspection?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In relation to the Helical Line Feature,
                    Liam’s evidence in his report was that one could discern the defect upon a
                    close examination under natural light. Liam explained during cross-examination
                    that a “very, very close examination” was required to see the
                    Helical Line Feature. The Helical Line Feature would however be clearly visible
                    if an intense light was shone <em>through</em> the Water
                    Inlet Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As for the hydrolytic degradation,
                    Liam’s evidence was that those defects would only be visible if a
                    “very strong light” was shone <em>through</em> the Water Inlet Hose. The degradation would not be
                    visible even if a light was shone directly on the surface of the Water Inlet
                    Hose. Cooper’s evidence was also that the hydrolytic degradation would not
                    be discernible from a visual inspection of the outside surface of the Water
                    Inlet Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Cheng did not specifically address whether the
                    Helical Line Feature or the hydrolytic degradation was visible on a reasonable
                    inspection. Cheng only pointed out that the Water Inlet Hose appeared to be
                    new.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     None of the witnesses testified on whether
                    either cause was discoverable on a reasonable inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Only the first defendant submitted on whether
                    the cause or causes of the rupture were discoverable on a reasonable inspection.
                    In the course of rebutting the plaintiff’s claims in nuisance and
                    negligence, the first defendant submitted that it had no reason to believe that
                    the Water Inlet Hose would rupture because the hydrolytic degradation to the
                    Water Inlet Hose was not discernible from the outside. The first defendant also
                    pointed out that the Helical Line Feature was only discernible on a very close
                    examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The finding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I am of the view that both the Helical Line
                    Feature and the hydrolytic degradation would not have been discovered on a
                    reasonable inspection. It was not disputed that the hydrolytic degradation was
                    not visible from the outside. A high intensity light had to be shone <em>through</em> the Water Inlet Hose in order to see the
                    hydrolytic degradation. I do not think that it is reasonable to expect either
                    defendant to have removed the Water Inlet Hose and shone a high intensity light
                    through it. As for the Helical Line Feature, having seen the photographs of the
                    Water Inlet Hose and a section of the Water Inlet Hose (in Exhibit D1), I accept
                    Liam’s evidence that a very close examination would have been required to
                    notice the Helical Line Feature. A reasonable person in the position of either
                    of the defendants would not have conducted such a close
                inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the second defendant install the Water Inlet Hose?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The second defendant’s Service Director
                    Goh Chin Siew (“Goh”), testified that the second defendant
                    reinstalled the WDU at the Second Floor Unit on 2 September 2004. Goh
                    accepted that the second defendant installed <em>a</em>
                    water inlet hose for the WDU on that day. However, he claimed that the second
                    defendant did not install <em>the</em> Water Inlet Hose.
                    Goh based his claim on an expert report provided by Cooper (“the
                    Burgoynes Preliminary Examination Report”). Cooper wrote in the Burgoynes
                    Preliminary Examination Report that the Water Inlet Hose was in “pristine
                    condition”, which was consistent with it having been installed
                    “very recently”. I should add that Cooper later clarified that his
                    opinion in the Burgoynes Preliminary Examination Report “was a
                    preliminary report based on a visual inspection only” and “did not
                    involve any detailed analysis”. Cooper subsequently revised his opinion.
                    His revised opinion was to the effect that even though the Water Inlet Hose
                    appeared to be in pristine condition, that did not necessarily mean that it was
                    installed recently. Cooper clarified that it was in fact not possible to
                    conclusively establish the age of the Water Inlet Hose because it did not have
                    any markings to indicate its date of manufacture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     During cross-examination, Goh added that
                    another basis for his claim that the Water Inlet Hose was not installed by the
                    second defendant was that the second defendant always supplied its workers with
                    the “John Guess” brand of hoses for installation as water inlet
                    hoses. Goh testified that “John Guess” brand hoses were white in
                    colour. Kuam Swee Lee (“Kuam”), the second defendant’s
                    service man who attended to the first defendant after the Water Inlet Hose
                    ruptured, testified that the ruptured Water Inlet Hose was black in colour.
                    However, Goh admitted that his workers might have purchased a black hose from a
                    hardware store to replace a water inlet hose. Unfortunately, the workers who
                    installed the WDU at the Second Floor Unit were not called to testify. Goh also
                    admitted that the second defendant was to supply the water inlet hoses for the
                    WDUs that it installed. He also agreed that he had no reason to believe that
                    anybody other than the second defendant had serviced the WDU after it was
                    installed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The first defendant’s managing director,
                    Adrian Ng (“Ng”), deposed that he could not recall whether the
                    Water Inlet Hose was installed at the time when the WDU was first installed at
                    the Second Floor Unit or whether it was installed during the second
                    defendant’s servicing of the WDU. Ng insisted however that the second
                    defendant installed the Water Inlet Hose because neither he nor any of the first
                    defendant’s employees installed the Water Inlet Hose or instructed anyone
                    else to install the Water Inlet Hose. Ng’s evidence was that the first
                    defendant entrusted the installation and servicing of the WDU and its piping
                    works to the second defendant. Two of the first defendant’s employees,
                    Christin Lim Hoon Eng and Zubaidah Saat, also deposed that they did not install
                    the Water Inlet Hose, nor did they instruct anyone to install the Water Inlet
                    Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The plaintiff and the first defendant both
                    submitted that the second defendant installed the Water Inlet Hose. They based
                    their submissions on the evidence summarised above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The second defendant submitted that the hose
                    it installed on 2 September 2004 was not the Water Inlet Hose. The second
                    defendant referred to Liam’s testimony during cross-examination. Liam had
                    suggested during cross-examination that the hydrolytic degradation observed on
                    the Water Inlet Hose might have occurred due to contact with water over a period
                    of several months. The second defendant submitted that it could not possibly
                    have installed the Water Inlet Hose if Liam’s evidence was accepted. If
                    the Water Inlet Hose was the hose that the second defendant installed on
                    2 September 2004, it would have ruptured within several months from its
                    installation, <em>viz</em>, by September 2005 at the
                    latest. The second defendant further argued that Cooper’s evidence was
                    consistent with Liam’s evidence because Cooper did not have any
                    fundamental disagreements with Liam’s evidence The second defendant also
                    referred to Cooper’s opinion in the Burgoynes Preliminary Examination
                    Report. The second defendant pointed out that Cooper’s revised opinion
                    that the Water Inlet Hose need not have been installed recently was based on the
                    assumption that the Water Inlet Hose was installed in a “relatively clean
                    environment”. The second defendant asserted that Cooper was not in a
                    position to give an opinion as to the state of the first defendant’s
                    premises because he did not inspect those premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff and the first defendant took
                    issue with the second defendant’s reliance on Liam’s testimony
                    during cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff argued that the second defendant
                    should have adduced expert evidence on the age of the Water Inlet Hose if its
                    case was that hydrolysis took only months. However, the second defendant did not
                    put forth any expert evidence on this point. It did not also put its case to
                    Liam that the Water Inlet Hose could not have been the one that it installed on
                    2 September 2004. The plaintiff submitted that the second defendant’s
                    belated reliance on this point should therefore be rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The first defendant pointed out that Liam
                    qualified his suggestion that the Water Inlet Hose had degraded over a matter of
                    months by saying that he could not put a figure to the duration of its exposure
                    to water because the speed with which a hose would degrade depends on various
                    factors such as its material composition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The finding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In my view, the evidence that suggests that
                    the Water Inlet Hose must have been the hose that the second defendant installed
                    on 2 September 2004 outweighs the evidence that suggests the contrary. The
                    second defendant admitted that it installed a water inlet hose on
                    2 September 2004. It also admitted that it had no reason to believe that
                    the WDU was maintained by anybody other than itself. In fact, it was the
                        <em>unchallenged</em> evidence of both Ng and the first
                    defendant’s other employees that they neither installed the Water Inlet
                    Hose by themselves nor did they instruct anyone else to install it. The only
                    evidence that suggests that the second defendant did not install the Water Inlet
                    Hose is the Burgoynes Preliminary Examination Report and Liam’s suggestion
                    that the Water Inlet Hose degraded over a period of several months. I do not
                    give much weight to either for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     Cooper did not conclude in the
                        Burgoynes Preliminary Examination Report that the Water Inlet Hose was in
                        fact new. He was merely pointing out that the pristine condition of the
                        Water Inlet Hose he visually examined <em>suggested</em> it was new. This was apparent from the following
                        extract of the Burgoynes Preliminary Examination Report:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Water Inlet Hose] is in pristine condition with only minimal wear and
                        abrasion present on the outer surfaces. The general condition of the [Water
                        Inlet Hose] <em>suggests</em> that it is nearly new,
                        which is consistent with it having been fitted to the [WDU] very recently.
                        The condition is not consistent with the reported age of the water cooler,
                        i.e. 4 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cooper was simply making the obvious point that the pristine condition of
                        the Water Inlet Hose suggested it was nearly new. He was not expressing his
                        expert view as to the precise age of the Water Inlet Hose. Indeed,
                        Cooper’s evidence was that he could not conclusively establish the age
                        of the Water Inlet Hose because of the absence of any markings on the Water
                        Inlet Hose. Accordingly, the “nearly new” physical appearance
                        of the Water Inlet Hose is merely one piece of evidence that I have to take
                        into account. The physical appearance of the Water Inlet Hose should not be
                        given too much weight because its pristine appearance may be due to reasons
                        other than its age. As Cooper suggested in his expert report, a hose may
                        appear new notwithstanding its age if it is kept in a relatively clean
                        environment and protected from wear and tear.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second defendant took
                        Liam’s suggestion out of context. As the first defendant pointed out,
                        Liam was not providing a firm view that the Water Inlet Hose degraded over a
                        period of months. The following extract from the notes of evidence (N/E 243)
                        shows that Liam had in fact emphasised that he could not provide the court
                        with a definitive figure for the length of degradation:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I therefore find on a balance of probabilities
                    that the second defendant did install the Water Inlet Hose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s claims against the first and second
                defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I will consider the plaintiff’s claims
                    against the first and second defendants together because the legal issues in
                    both claims are similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The nuisance claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The relevant principles are not disputed and
                    may be concisely stated. The essence of an actionable private nuisance is the
                    “causing or permitting of a state of affairs” which interferes
                    with the ownership or occupation of land (see <em>OTF Aquarium
                        Farm (formerly known as Ong’s Tropical Fish Aquarium &amp; Fresh
                        Flowers) (a firm) v Lian Shing Construction Co Pte Ltd (Liberty Insurance
                        Pte Ltd, Third Party)</em> [2007] SGHC 122
                        (“<em>OTF Aquarium Farm</em>”) at
                        [23] and <em>Clerk
                        and Lindsell on Torts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        20<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2010) (“<em>Clerk
                        and Lindsell</em>”) at para 20-01). The interference does
                    not have to be persistent in order for it to be regarded as an actionable
                    private nuisance. A single interference, such as the seepage of water in the
                    present case, may be actionable provided that the “state of
                    affairs” at the property from which the interference emanated was
                    potentially hazardous (see <em>Hygeian Medical Supplies Pte Ltd v
                        Tri-Star Rotary Screen Engraving Works Pte Ltd (Seng Wing Engineering Works
                        Pte Ltd, third party)</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 411
                        (“<em>Hygeian Medical Supplies</em>”) at
                        [22]–[23]; <em>Clerk and
                        Lindsell</em> at para 20-16).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It is pertinent to note that the owner or
                    occupier of the land from which the interference emanates is not the only person
                    who may be liable for the nuisance. A third party, such as the second defendant
                    in this case, may also be liable if it caused the interference (see <em>Clerk and Lindsell</em> at para 20-70).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The only other element that I should mention
                    is the requirement that the type of damage caused by the nuisance must be
                    reasonably foreseeable (see <em>OTF Aquarium Farm</em> at
                        [23]–[27]). This element is particularly relevant
                    in this case because of the presence of an independent contractor (<em>ie</em> the second defendant). An owner or occupier of the
                    land from which the nuisance emanated might argue that the nuisance was created
                    by an independent contractor and it should therefore not be held liable for the
                    nuisance. However, it is not sufficient for an owner or occupier to simply
                    assert that an independent contractor caused the interference. An owner or
                    occupier may nonetheless be liable for the nuisance in such circumstances if it
                    could have reasonably foreseen that a nuisance might result from the work done
                    by the independent contractor (see <em>Clerk and
                        Lindsell</em> at para 20-72).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I find that the seepage of water from the
                    Second Floor Unit constituted an interference with the plaintiff’s use of
                    the Art Gallery. As I mentioned earlier, a single interference may amount to a
                    nuisance if the state of affairs at the land from which the interference
                    emanated was potentially hazardous (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>). In my view, the placement of the WDU at the WDU Area and the
                    use of the Water Inlet Hose was a potentially hazardous state of affairs. It was
                    not disputed that water could permeate through the floor at the WDU Area.
                    Therefore, the placement of the WDU at the WDU Area was potentially hazardous
                    because any leakage from the WDU or the Water Inlet Hose could result in seepage
                    of water. As for the use of the Water Inlet Hose, I have found that the Water
                    Inlet Hose ruptured due to a combination of the hydrolytic degradation and the
                    Helical Line Feature (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>). The
                    hydrolytic degradation occurred because the Water Inlet Hose was made of a
                    material that was unsuitable for the carriage of water (see [24(c)] and
                    [26(b)]). Given those circumstances, the use of the Water Inlet Hose with the
                    WDU was a potential hazard. Put simply, the rupturing of the Water Inlet Hose
                    was an accident waiting to happen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Both defendants are liable for the
                    interference. As alluded to in the previous paragraph, the interference was
                    caused by a combination of three causes. The first two causes were the
                    hydrolytic degradation and the Helical Line Feature. I had found that the Water
                    Inlet Hose ruptured due to hydrolytic degradation and the Helical Line Feature
                    (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>). The third cause was the location
                    of the WDU at the WDU Area because the flooring of the WDU Area was such that
                    water could permeate through it. The first defendant is however responsible for
                    only the third cause because it instructed the second defendant to locate the
                    WDU at the WDU Area. It is not responsible for the first two causes because the
                    Helical Line Feature and the hydrolytic degradation were not visible on a
                    reasonable inspection (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The second defendant is responsible for the
                    first two causes because, as I have found, the second defendant installed the
                    Water Inlet Hose (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>). The second
                    defendant is also partially responsible for the third cause because it installed
                    the WDU at the WDU Area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It remains to be considered whether either
                    defendant could have reasonably foreseen the nuisance. In my view, the nuisance
                    was reasonably foreseeable to both defendants. The first defendant submitted
                    that it could not have foreseen the nuisance because it engaged an independent
                    contractor to install and maintain the WDU. However, I find that a reasonable
                    person in the position of the first defendant would have foreseen the nuisance.
                    A reasonable person would have known that locating a WDU at the WDU Area could
                    result in seepage of water to the Art Gallery because of the nature of the
                    flooring at the WDU Area. A reasonable person would have also taken heed of the
                    Quotation Warning in the quotation for the reinstallation of the WDU at the
                    Second Floor Unit (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>) and the
                    Disclaimer in the Second Maintenance Contract and the Third Maintenance Contract
                    (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). Those warnings indicated that it
                    was not safe to locate a WDU at the WDU Area. I note that the first
                    defendant’s employees had testified that they did not notice the warnings.
                    However, the analysis is objective. In my view, a reasonable person should have
                    taken heed of the warnings and would have realised that directing an independent
                    contractor to install a WDU at the WDU Area might result in the nuisance. A
                    reasonable person in the position of the second defendant would have also
                    foreseen the possibility of the nuisance for the same reason. The Quotation
                    Warning and the Disclaimer were found on the second defendant’s own
                    documents. A reasonable person would have taken heed of his own
                warnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I therefore find both the first and second
                    defendants liable to the plaintiff in the tort of private
                nuisance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The negligence claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It is not strictly necessary to go on to
                    consider the plaintiff’s claims in negligence and the rule in <em>Rylands v Fletcher</em> given this court’s conclusion
                    that both defendants are liable for nuisance. I will nevertheless briefly
                    consider the claims in negligence for completeness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The relevant principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As mentioned above (see [21(a)] and [21(d)]),
                    the defendants had only contested the existence of a duty of care and the breach
                    of that duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Court of Appeal in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology
                        Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”) restated the test that Singapore
                    courts should apply in determining whether a duty of care exists. A two stage
                    test should be applied along with a threshold consideration of factual
                    foreseeability (<em>Spandeck</em> at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>). The first stage requires the court to
                    determine if there is sufficient legal proximity between the parties (<em>Spandeck</em> at [77]). The Court of Appeal endorsed Deane J’s analysis of the
                    concept of proximity in <em>Sutherland Shire Council v
                        Heyman</em> (1985) 60 ALR 1 (“<em>Sutherland</em>”) at 55–56 (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [78]–[79] and
                        [81]). Deane J’s analysis
                    was as follows (<em>Sutherland</em> at 55–56):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The requirement of proximity is directed <em>to the
                            relationship between the parties</em> in so far as it is relevant
                        to the allegedly negligent act or omission of the defendant and the loss or
                        injury sustained by the plaintiff. It involves <em>the notion
                            of nearness or closeness and embraces physical</em>proximity (in
                        the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff
                        and the person or property of the defendant, <em>circumstantial</em>proximity such as an overriding relationship
                        of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what
                        may (perhaps loosely) be referred to as <em>causal</em>
                        proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal
                        connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct
                        and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect an <em>assumption by one party of a responsibility</em> to take care to
                        avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another
                        or <em>reliance</em>by one party upon such care being
                        taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to
                        have known of that reliance. <em>Both the identity and the
                            relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue
                            of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of
                            case</em>. That does not mean that there is scope for decision by
                        reference to idiosyncratic notions of justice or morality or that it is a
                        proper approach to treat the requirement of proximity as a <em>question of fact to be resolved merely by reference to the
                            relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant in the particular
                            circumstances</em>. The requirement of a relationship of proximity
                            <em>serves as a touchstone and control of the categories
                            of case in which the common law will adjudge that a duty of care is
                            owed</em>. Given the general circumstances of a case in a new or
                        developing area of the law of negligence, the question what (if any)
                        combination or combinations of factors will satisfy the requirement of
                        proximity is a <em>question of law to be resolved by the
                            processes of legal reasoning, induction and deduction. On the other
                            hand, the identification of the content of that requirement in such an
                            area should not be either ostensibly or actually divorced from notions
                            of what is 'fair and reasonable' ... or from the considerations of
                            public policy which underlie and enlighten the existence and content of
                            the requirement</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second stage requires the court to determine if a duty should not
                    be imposed because of policy considerations (<em>Spandeck</em> at [83]). Both
                    stages of the test should be applied incrementally. This means that the courts
                    should refer to previous cases with analogous facts and consider whether a duty
                    of care should be extended (<em>Spandeck</em> at [73] and [115]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In my view, the first defendant owed the
                    plaintiff a duty of care. The threshold requirement of factual foreseeability is
                    satisfied. I held earlier that both defendants could have reasonably foreseen
                    the nuisance (see <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a>). The same analysis
                    applies here. The first defendant could have reasonably foreseen that its
                    instruction to the second defendant to locate the WDU at the WDU Area could
                    cause damage to the plaintiff’s property. Turning to the requirement of
                    proximity, my view is that there was sufficient proximity between the plaintiff
                    and the first defendant. There is physical proximity between them because they
                    were neighbours. It was also reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the first
                    defendant to take reasonable measures to avoid the seepage of water. The first
                    defendant should have known that the plaintiff would rely on it to take such
                    measures given the close physical proximity between the units and the fact that
                    the flooring at the WDU Area was permeable to water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     There is in fact recent authority for finding
                    a duty of care between neighbours in such circumstances. The recent case of
                        <em>PC Connect Pte Ltd v HSBC Institutional Trust Services
                        (Singapore) Ltd (trustee of CapitaMall Trust) and another (Bachmann Japanese
                        Restaurant Pte Ltd, third party)</em> [2010] SGHC 154
                        (“<em>PC Connect</em>”), concerned a
                    claim by an occupier of a unit in a shopping mall (“Unit A”)
                    against the occupier of a unit above Unit A (“Unit B”) for damage
                    due to water seepage. The High Court held that the occupier of Unit B owed a
                    duty of care to the occupier of Unit A (<em>PC Connect</em>
                    at [31]). A duty of care relationship
                    was also found to exist between neighbours in <em>Hygeian Medical
                        Supplies</em> (at [18]). The
                    facts of <em>Hygeian Medical Supplies</em> were also
                    analogous to the present case. Water from one unit flooded into another unit
                    because of a dislodged water hose. As for the second stage of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, I do not find that there are any relevant
                    public policy considerations that militate against the finding of a duty of
                    care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It is also my view that the first defendant
                    breached its duty of care by instructing the second defendant to install the WDU
                    at the WDU Area. I accept that the first defendant may well have thought it had
                    no alternative but to install the WDU at the WDU Area. During cross-examination,
                    Ng mentioned, for the first time, that he had three reasons for not locating the
                    WDU in the wet pantry area. First, the wet pantry area was exposed to direct
                    sunlight and accordingly, locating the WDU at the wet pantry area might shorten
                    its lifespan. Second, the door leading to the wet pantry area opened into the
                    wet pantry area. The door would have obstructed access to the WDU if the WDU was
                    located in the wet pantry area. Third, Ng did not think it was safe for his
                    employees’ health to locate the WDU at the wet pantry area because the
                    first defendant used that area to spray adhesives onto presentation boards. I do
                    not think that any of these concerns were very substantial because Ng admitted
                    that the first defendant installed the WDU at the wet pantry area after the
                    incident. He also conceded that if he had given the location of the WDU more
                    thought, he would not have installed it at the WDU Area. In any case, in my
                    view, a reasonable person would have taken precautions against the leakage of
                    water. The WDU Area was permeable to water. The first defendant was warned that
                    the WDU should be installed at a wet pantry area (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). It does not
                    matter that the first defendant did not read those warnings. A reasonable person
                    would have read them. If the wet pantry area was really not an option, the first
                    defendant should not have installed the WDU at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It should be noted that the plaintiff had
                    called an expert witness Wan Fook Kong (“Wan”) to testify on
                    whether it was appropriate to locate the WDU at the WDU Area. Wan’s
                    evidence was that it was not in accordance with good housekeeping practices to
                    locate the WDU at the WDU Area. His evidence was largely unchallenged and the
                    defendants did not call their own experts to testify on whether the WDU Area was
                    a suitable area for locating the WDU. However, Wan did not refer to any
                    objective standards to justify his opinion. In any event, as I have explained,
                    my view is that a reasonable person would not have installed the WDU at a wet
                    pantry area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It is not a valid defence for the first
                    defendant to contend that it is not liable because of its engagement of an
                    independent contractor. It is well established that engaging an independent
                    contractor does not excuse an employer for his <em>own</em>
                    acts of negligence (see <em>Clerk and Lindsell</em> at
                    para 6-56). Here, the first defendant went beyond simply engaging an
                    independent contractor. It instructed the independent contractor to install the
                    WDU at the WDU Area. In my view, that act, by itself, amounts to
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Therefore, my view is that the first defendant
                    is also liable to the plaintiff in the tort of negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I am not entirely satisfied that the second
                    defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care. The plaintiff only referred to
                        <em>Spandeck</em> in its closing submissions in support
                    of its case against the second defendant in negligence. It did not refer to any
                    cases where a duty of care was imposed in analogous fact situations. However, in
                    its opening statement, the plaintiff referred to <em>Fisher v
                        Harrods Ltd</em> [1966] 1 QB 500 (“<em>Fisher</em>”) in support of its argument that the second
                    defendant owed it a duty of care. That case concerned a claim in negligence
                    against a department store for its sale of a bottle of jewellery cleaning fluid
                    to the plaintiff. Various allegations were made in relation to the failure to
                    warn the plaintiff about, <em>inter alia</em>, the chemical
                    contents of the jewellery cleaning fluid and the manner in which the bottle
                    should be opened (<em>Fisher</em> at 501–502). I do
                    not see how that case is analogous to the present case. Although the novelty of
                    a fact situation does not preclude the imposition of a duty of care (<em>Spandeck</em> at [73]
                    and [115]), in my view, it is important to tread cautiously in such situations.
                    In the absence of any detailed argument, I make no finding as to whether the
                    second defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The claim under the rule in Rylands v Fletcher</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The relevant principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The rule in <em>Rylands v
                        Fletcher</em> allows a party to claim for damage caused by the escape
                    of dangerous things brought onto the defendant’s land where the bringing
                    of those dangerous things constituted a non-natural use of the defendant’s
                    land (<em>Clerk and Lindsell</em> at para 20-44). The
                    rule has been applied in Singapore (see, for example, <em>Tesa
                        Tape Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Wing Seng Logistics Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    3 SLR(R) 116 (“<em>Tesa
                    Tape</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The first defendant’s argument was that
                    the bringing of the WDU into its premises was not a non-natural use of the
                    Second Floor Unit. The first defendant relied on <em>Transco plc
                        v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council</em> [2004] 2 AC 1
                        (“<em>Transco</em>”). In <em>Transco</em>, a water pipe supplying water to a block of
                    flats ruptured. The resulting flood caused an embankment to give way and exposed
                    a gas pipe belonging to the plaintiff. The plaintiff then brought a claim
                    against the owner of the water pipe for its costs in restoring the support to
                    the gas pipe. The House of Lords held that the piping of water to water storage
                    tanks in a block of flats was a normal use of land (<em>Transco</em> at [13],
                        [49], [67], [90] and [111]).
                    Relying on this statement, the first defendant argued that if a supply of water
                    is considered a natural use of land, then the distribution of water within the
                    premises would <em>a fortiori</em> constitute a natural
                    use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I disagree. In my view, it is necessary to
                    consider the circumstances under which the dangerous thing was brought onto the
                    defendant’s land. This is apparent from <em>Balfour v
                        Barty-King and another</em> [1956] 1 WLR 779
                        (“<em>Balfour</em>”), a case cited by the
                    plaintiff. In <em>Balfour</em>, the defendants hired
                    contractors to thaw frozen pipes in their attic. The contractors used a
                    blowtorch to thaw the pipes. The blowtorch ignited some straw and caused a fire
                    which damaged the plaintiff’s premises. The following portion of the
                    decision is useful (<em>Balfour</em> at 791):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears that the user of a blowlamp for the purpose of thawing out a
                        pipe <em>is a recognized method of thawing out a pipe in an
                            appropriate place and appropriate circumstances, but in other places it
                            is not only not a recognized practice, but it is an extremely dangerous
                            practice, and one which no prudent workman or contractor would have
                            adopted</em>. <em>I have to have regard to all the
                            circumstances of time and place and the practice of the trade, and,
                            applying that test, I feel constrained to come to the conclusion that
                            the user of the blowlamp in these particular circumstances in this loft,
                            so close to all this combustible material, did constitute the blowlamp
                            an object of the class to which the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher
                            applies</em>. I hold, therefore, in so far as it is a question of
                        law for me, that the user of the blowlamp in this place by Brown under these
                        circumstances was dangerous, and that it was likely to do mischief if the
                        dangerous element in it, that is to say, the fire, escaped. I also hold, if
                        it is a necessary requisite for the application of the rule in <em>Rylands v. Fletcher</em> to this case, that to bring the
                        blowlamp to this position in which it was ignited and used was to make a
                        non-natural user of that place. It was a special user, bringing with it
                        increased danger to others, and was not merely the ordinary user of the
                        land. I hold, therefore, that the blowlamp was, in the circumstances, an
                        object of the class to which the rule in <em>Rylands v.
                            Fletcher</em> applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is crucial to note that the court held that even though the use of
                    a blowlamp was a recognised method of thawing pipes in appropriate
                    circumstances, it was dangerous to use it in the particular circumstances of the
                    case. I take a similar view. Although the use of a WDU, when viewed in the
                    abstract, appears to be a natural use of land, it was not a natural use in the
                    particular circumstances of this case. The placement of the WDU at the WDU Area,
                    when combined with the Helical Line Feature and the gradual hydrolytic
                    degradation of the Water Inlet Hose, made the use of <em>this</em> WDU a non-natural use of the Second Floor
                Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     My view therefore is that the first defendant
                    is liable to the plaintiff under the rule in <em>Rylands v
                        Fletcher</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Should there be one judgment against the defendants or should there
                be apportionment of liability between the defendants?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The relevant principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Court of Appeal in <em>Chuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v Setron Ltd and another appeal</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 771 (“<em>Chuang
                    Uming</em>”) decided that a separate judgment should only be issued
                    if the damage suffered by the plaintiff is capable of being isolated and
                    attributed to the particular acts of each defendant (at [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In cases, such as this, where the damage or injury was occasioned by more
                        than one party, the question whether there should be a joint judgment or
                        separate judgments depends essentially on the facts and in particular on the
                        damage caused. <em>Where the damage caused can be so
                            identified and isolated as to be attributable to the negligent act or
                            the breach of contract of each party, then a separate judgment in
                            respect of that damage can be entered against each of the parties.
                            Where, however, the damage caused by the parties cannot be so identified
                            and isolated, and in reality forms indivisible parts of the entire
                            damage, we do not see how separate judgments can be entered against them
                            separately</em>. Reverting to the facts in this case, clearly both
                        the defective workmanship and the defective design contributed to the
                        debonding of the tiles. We are in agreement with the learned judge that the
                        breaches of the contractors and the architects "indisputably overlap and
                        interweave" and both contributed to the same damage. In such a case, a joint
                        judgment is the natural result as there is no reason, in principle, to limit
                        the owner to recovering only part of the loss from one party and the
                        remaining part from the other. The apportionment of the liability between
                        the contractors and the architects in percentage terms is not a logical
                        corollary of the separate breaches of contract, but a device to ensure that
                        justice is done as between the contractors and the architects <em>inter se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     A related issue is the apportionment of
                    liability between the tortfeasors <em>inter se</em>. In
                    this regard, the Court of Appeal in <em>Chuang Uming</em>
                    held, in the context of apportioning liability between parties who breached
                    their respective contracts, that the court should apportion liability in a
                    manner that is just and equitable (<em>Chuang Uming</em> at
                        [43]). The court should consider the
                    relative blameworthiness of each defendant in determining a just and equitable
                    apportionment of liability (<em>Chuang Uming</em> at
                        [43]–[44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I find that the plaintiff is entitled to a
                    joint judgment against both the first defendant and the second defendant. I am
                    unable to attribute the acts of either defendant to distinct portions of the
                    damage suffered by the plaintiff. As I held earlier (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>), the plaintiff’s damage was caused by
                    a <em>combination</em> of three causes, <em>viz</em>, the Helical Line Feature, hydrolytic degradation and the
                    location of the WDU at the WDU Area. It is not possible to say that each cause
                    resulted in a specific kind of damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As for apportionment of liability between the
                    defendants <em>inter se</em>, I find that a just and
                    equitable apportionment is 30% liability to the first defendant and 70%
                    liability to the second defendant. As earlier held (see <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>), the first defendant is only responsible for one cause of
                    the damage. It instructed the second defendant to install the WDU at the WDU
                    Area. However, the first defendant was not entirely to blame for this cause. The
                    second defendant was also responsible for the location of the WDU at the WDU
                    Area. The second defendant did not take heed of its own warnings (<em>ie</em>, the Quotation Warning and the Disclaimer – see
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> respectively) which indicated that the WDU should be
                    installed in the WDU Area. The second defendant is also solely responsible for
                    the other two causes because it installed the Water Inlet Hose (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>). The second defendant used a hose that was
                    not suitable for the carriage of water (see [24(c)] and [26(b)]). Given the
                    relative contributions of the defendants to the causes of the damage, I find
                    that a just and equitable apportionment is 30-70 in favour of the first and
                    second defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The indemnity or contribution proceedings between the first defendant
                and the second defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I turn next to consider if the first defendant
                    is entitled to a contribution or indemnity from the second defendant because of
                    my finding that the first defendant is liable to the plaintiff for nuisance.
                    This issue is relevant because I have apportioned 30% of the defendants’
                    liability to the plaintiff to the first defendant. If the first defendant is
                    entitled to an indemnity, then, as between the first and the second defendants,
                    the first defendant will be entitled to an indemnity for any amount that the
                    plaintiff recovers from the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I have to consider two issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the second defendant breach the
                        Reinstallation Agreement and/or the Maintenance
                    Contracts?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so,
                        do the Quotation Warning and/or the Disclaimer exempt the second defendant
                        from liability?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the second defendant breach the Reinstallation Agreement and/or
                the Maintenance Contracts?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Did the second defendant breach the Reinstallation
                Agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Reinstallation Agreement was formed after
                    the first defendant accepted the Quotation. The Quotation did not contain any
                    express terms warranting the quality and fitness of the Water Inlet Hose. The
                    first defendant argued, however, that the Supply of Goods Act (Cap 394, 1999 Rev
                    Ed) (“the SGA”) is applicable. The first defendant then argued
                    that the second defendant breached the implied terms imposed under s 4 of the
                    SGA specifically that the Water Inlet Hose would be of satisfactory quality and
                    fit for its intended purpose of carrying water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The second defendant did not respond to this
                    argument. The second defendant merely maintained that it did not agree to
                    install the Water Inlet Hose because it did not in fact install that hose. This
                    argument is unsustainable given my finding that the second defendant installed
                    the Water Inlet Hose (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>). It is
                    nevertheless necessary for me to consider if the SGA applied to the
                    Reinstallation Agreement and, if so, whether the terms implied by the SGA were
                    breached.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   does the SGA apply to the reinstallation
                agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The implied terms in s 4 of the SGA apply to
                    “contracts for the transfer of goods”. Section 1 of the SGA
                    defines that term in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The contracts concerned</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. —(1) In this Act, “contract for the transfer of
                        goods” means a contract under which one person transfers or agrees to
                        transfer to another the property in goods, other than an excepted
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) For the purposes of this section, an excepted contract
                        means any of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) a contract of sale of goods;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) a hire-purchase agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) a transfer or agreement to transfer which is made by deed and for
                            which there is no consideration other than the presumed consideration
                            imported by the deed; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) a contract intended to operate by way of mortgage, pledge, charge
                            or other security.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) For the purposes of this Act, a contract is a contract for the
                        transfer of goods <em>whether or not services are also
                            provided or to be provided under the contract</em>, and, subject
                        to subsection (2), whatever is the nature of the consideration for the
                        transfer or agreement to transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is important to note that a contract will be regarded as a contract
                    for the transfer of goods even if it contemplates that services will be provided
                    under the contract (s 1(3) of the SGA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I am of the view that the SGA applies to the
                    Reinstallation Agreement. The essence of the Reinstallation Agreement was for
                    the second defendant to relocate the WDU. This involved the provision of
                    services. However, the Reinstallation Agreement also contemplated the supply of
                    additional piping. This is evident from the following description of the work to
                    be done by the second defendant in the Quotation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">TO RELOCATE 1 x W/DSP</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(WITHIN 3M WITH PIPING &amp; WIRING READY)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>ADDITION 3M PIPING</em> &amp; 4M WIRING @
                        $20.00/M</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">TO INSTALL 1 x STOP COCK</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">TO INSTALL 1 x 15AMP PLUG + LABOUR</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The emphasised words show that the Reinstallation Agreement
                    contemplated the supply of piping. I have found that the second defendant in
                    fact supplied the Water Inlet Hose when it reinstalled the WDU to the Second
                    Floor Unit. The fact that the Reinstallation Agreement also involved the
                    provision of services does not detract from it being a contract for the transfer
                    of goods within the meaning of the SGA. As I have mentioned, s 1(3) of the SGA
                    provides that a contract will be regarded as a contract for the transfer of
                    goods even if it contemplates that services will be provided under the contract
                    (see [86]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Did the second defendant breach the terms implied by the
                SGA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Section 4 of the SGA implies two conditions
                    into contracts for the transfer of goods. First, s 4(2) implies that the goods
                    supplied under the contract are of “satisfactory quality”. Section
                    4(2A) provides for an objective test for determining whether the goods are of
                    satisfactory quality:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2A) For the purposes of this section and section 5, goods are of
                        satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person
                        would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the
                        goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 4(3) of the SGA provides that the implied condition of
                    satisfactory quality does not apply in some situations. None of those situations
                    are relevant in the present case. The second implied condition is that the goods
                    supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for any particular purpose that
                    was made known to the transferee, whether expressly or by implication (ss 4(4)
                    and 4(5) of the SGA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I find that the second defendant breached both
                    implied conditions. The Water Inlet Hose that it supplied was not of
                    satisfactory quality because a reasonable person would consider that a hose
                    meant to carry water should not be made of a material prone to hydrolytic
                    degradation. The second implied condition was breached for the same reason. The
                    implied purpose of the Water Inlet Hose must be that it was to carry water. The
                    Water Inlet Hose was not reasonably fit for that purpose on any view given my
                    finding that it was made of a material prone to hydrolytic
                degradation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Did the second defendant breach the Maintenance
                Agreements?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It is not necessary for me to consider if the
                    second defendant breached the Maintenance Agreements in view of my finding that
                    the second defendant breached the Reinstallation Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Do the Quotation Warning and/or the Disclaimer exempt the second
                defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It is only necessary to consider if the
                    Quotation Warning exempts the second defendant given my finding that the second
                    defendant breached the Reinstallation Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The relevant principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The principles governing the interpretation of
                    exemption clauses are well established. I only need to refer to two principles.
                    First, the exemption clause must specifically cover the contingency or loss for
                    which exemption is sought (see <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) at
                    para 14-006). Second, the exemption clause will be construed <em>contra proferentem</em> (see <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> at para 14-009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994
                    Rev Ed) (“the UCTA”) is relevant. In particular, s 7(2) of the
                    UCTA provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that liability in
                    respect of the quality of goods or their fitness for any particular purpose
                    cannot be excluded as against a person dealing as a consumer:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Miscellaneous contracts under which goods pass.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. —(1) Where the possession or ownership of goods passes under or
                        in pursuance of a contract not governed by the law of sale of goods or
                        hire-purchase, subsections (2) to (4) apply as regards the effect (if any)
                        to be given to contract terms excluding or restricting liability for breach
                        of obligation arising by implication of law from the nature of the
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) As against a person dealing as consumer, liability in respect of the
                        goods’ correspondence with description or sample, or their quality or
                        fitness for any particular purpose, cannot be excluded or restricted by
                        reference to any such term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Section 12 of the UCTA provides guidelines for
                    determining whether a contracting party was dealing as a consumer:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dealing as consumer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12. —(1) A party to a contract “deals as consumer” in
                        relation to another party if —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) he neither makes the contract in the course of a business nor holds
                        himself out as doing so;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the other party does make the contract in the course of a business;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) in the case of a contract governed by the law of sale of goods or
                        hire-purchase, or by section 7, the goods passing under or in pursuance of
                        the contract are of a type ordinarily supplied for private use or
                        consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) But on a sale by auction or by competitive tender the buyer is not in
                        any circumstances to be regarded as dealing as consumer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Subject to this, it is for those claiming that a party does not deal
                        as consumer to show that he does not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I find that the Quotation Warning does not
                    exempt the second defendant from its liability for installing the Water Inlet
                    Hose. The Quotation Warning only excludes liability for “damages
                        [<em>sic</em>] resulting from the [<em>sic</em>] leaking or flooding from the filer [<em>sic</em>] or water dispenser”. It does not specifically cover
                    any liability for damage resulting from leakage from the Water Inlet Hose. It
                    does not also specifically exempt the second defendant from what the first
                    defendant is claiming against the second defendant. The first defendant is
                    claiming for an indemnity in respect of its liability to a third party. The
                    Quotation Warning only contemplates physical damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In any event, the Quotation Warning cannot
                    exclude liability for the quality of the Water Inlet Hose and its fitness for
                    the particular purpose for which it was supplied (see s 7(2) of the UCTA). As
                    the first defendant has argued, it was dealing as a consumer in relation to the
                    Reinstallation Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     For the reasons given above, the plaintiff
                    succeeds in his claim against the first and second defendant. The plaintiff will
                    have interlocutory judgment against both defendants. The liability of the
                    defendants <em>inter se</em> is apportioned at 30%
                    liability to the first defendant and 70% liability to the second defendant.
                    However, the first defendant is entitled to an indemnity from the second
                    defendant in respect of its 30% liability (when quantified) as well as its
                    liability for costs because of the second defendant’s breach of the
                    Reinstallation Agreement. Damages for the plaintiff’s claim will be
                    assessed by the Registrar with the costs of such assessment reserved to the
                    Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     As the plaintiff has succeeded in his action
                    against both defendants, he is entitled to costs for the proceedings. The
                    liability of the defendants <em>inter se</em> for the
                    plaintiff’s costs (when taxed or otherwise agreed) will mirror their
                    liability to the plaintiff, <em>ie</em>, the first
                    defendant will be liable for 30% of the plaintiff’s costs and the second
                    defendant will be liable for 70% of the plaintiff’s costs. As stated in
                        <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a> above, the first defendant is
                    entitled to recover from the second defendant the costs that it pays to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As the first defendant has succeeded in its
                    proceedings against the second defendant for an indemnity or a contribution, it
                    follows that it is entitled to recover its costs from the second
                    defendant.</p>
