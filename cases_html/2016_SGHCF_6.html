</div> I dealt with the division of assets, maintenance for the wife and son, and costs of proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Division of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The operative date</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The operative date for delineating the pool of assets must first be decided. In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>”), the Court of Appeal noted (at [39]) that there were four possible dates: (a) the date of separation; (b) the date that the writ for divorce was filed; (c) the date of interim judgment; and (d) the date of the hearing of ancillary matters. The court did not definitively pronounce on which of these dates should be applied, given the diverse circumstances under which a divorce can occur (at [36]); although the court was of the view that it would appear sensible to apply either the interim judgment date or the date of the ancillary matters hearing. In <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon v Lee Siew Lin</span> [2014] 1 SLR 629, the Court of Appeal again held that “there is no hard and fast cut-off date for the determination of the pool of matrimonial assets and everything would, in the final analysis, depend on the precise facts of the case itself” (at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the present case, the wife’s indirect contribution to the family in caring for the son and the home had continued all the while, as did the husband’s provision of the financial aspect of indirect contribution. In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Gim Tong Michael v Tianzon Lolita</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Tianzon</span>”), the Court of Appeal adopted the date of the ancillary matters hearing as the operative date because the wife continued to look after the child of the marriage after the grant of the interim judgment. In this case, where there was continuing contribution by the husband to the assets held in the wife’s name and continuing contribution by the wife to the home and son’s welfare, I was of the view that the operative date should be as close as practicable to the date of the ancillary matters hearing. The Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> that the adoption of an operative date may not really be that critical as compared to arriving at a just and equitable division (at [36]). Here, I found it to be just and equitable for assets after the interim judgment to be included and valued as near to the date for the hearing of the ancillary matters as practicable.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I am aware that subsequent to the delivery of my decision in the present case, the Court of Appeal has given guidance, in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> [2016] SGCA 13 at [31], that “unless the particular circumstances or justice of the case warrant it, the <span class="font-italic">starting point </span>or <span class="font-italic">default position </span>should be the date that interim judgment is granted” [emphasis in original]. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal expressly preserved the judge’s discretion to determine the operative date<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [34]–[35]). The Court of Appeal also upheld, on the facts of the case, the High Court’s use of the date of the hearing of ancillary matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Bearing in mind that the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> that a wife’s continued contribution in looking after children might be unexceptional in itself, I am of the view that there were further specific features in the case at hand that suggest that using a date nearer to the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, which the husband’s counsel also asked for in arguments, is fairer to the parties. Here, a substantial number of the husband’s shares in the company crystallised in 2013, before the interim judgment, arising from the takeover of his employer. Some part of the share proceeds might have gone, directly or otherwise, into the continued acquisition of certain assets in the pool. These included properties such as the unit in Punggol Central, Soho Tower (“Punggol Soho”), for which an outstanding balance of $0.7m remained as of 8 October 2014.

</div> These assets might need to be sold or re-mortgaged depending on the outcome of the asset division. In the present downward trending market, using dates after the interim judgment would be more equitable as the values would be closer to those used in a subsequent sale or re-mortgage. In addition, a component of the asset pool comprised shares that vested and/or would vest after interim judgment. While the vesting of these shares was contingent on his continued performance, the grant of the shares was only possible because of the years of work that the husband had put into the company while the parties were married, and it was the wife’s contribution to the home and looking after the son that allowed the husband to focus on his work, especially in the years when he was based in Malaysia.

There, the Court of Appeal approved of the use of a “time rule” and an “if and as when” order. The “time rule” treated as matrimonial assets only that portion of the stock options which was obtained by multiplying the stock options in question by a fraction. The numerator of this fraction was the period in months between the commencement of the husband’s employment at his company and the date of the interim judgment. The denominator was the period in months between his commencement of employment with his company and the date when the stock options were exercisable by him. On the facts however, the Court of Appeal did not intervene as it did not think that the 15% entitlement as granted by the High Court was unreasonable (at [38]). The Court of Appeal also approved the High Court’s grant of an “if and as when” order.

Noting that the share price had dropped significantly, the wife further submitted that this was not an appropriate case to apply the “if and as when” order.

</div> Given the difficulties in applying <span class="font-italic">David Chan</span>, she submitted that (a) all the unvested shares should be considered matrimonial assets liable to division instead of applying the “time rule”; and (b) the court should simply order the husband to “transfer” a percentage of shares, to be determined by the court, to the wife instead of imposing an “if and as when” order. While the shares in dispute were not vested and therefore could not be transferred, she suggested that the husband could use his existing shares in the company to “off-set” the transfer first. Otherwise, she submitted that the unvested shares should be valued at $2.18 per share, which put their maximum potential value at $436,935.22.

</div> While the award and allotment of shares to him would be reflected in the company’s statements, whether he eventually got these shares still depended on his performance and that of the company. Confirmation would only come when the shares were finally vested in his share deposit account. In short, the husband seemed to be saying that the number of shares that would eventually vest, and when they would vest, were highly uncertain. He submitted that the share awards from 2015 to 2016 might not even come to be vested “because of the cessation of his employment contract as a Consultant by September 2016. In all probability, if his employer is kind enough, he will probably get half of each type of award if he fulfils his targets when his contract of employment expires in 2016”.

Thus, the husband said that given the declining market value of the company’s shares, “even if the unvested stock options … are eventually given to him by the time of his retirement in September 2016, he may not exercise them at all.

In the case at hand, one could similarly say that there were shares that ultimately might not vest. Therefore, it would be possible to order an allocation “if and as when” the shares vested in the husband. Nevertheless, there would arise the same difficulties faced in applying the “time rule”. Because it was unclear when and upon what contingency the shares would vest, imposing either rule would leave the wife the burden of the uncertainty. She would not know when each batch of shares would vest or how many shares there would be; and, in the light of the state of their relationship, it would be impracticable for a court order to rely wholly on the husband to tell her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the present case, I noted that whether the value of the unvested shares used was the wife’s ($436,935.22) or the husband’s ($354,000), the amount was not high compared to the size of the matrimonial pool. It made better sense to divide the value of these unvested shares at the same time as the division of the other assets in the matrimonial pool. In such cases where documentary evidence falls short, the guidance of the Court of Appeal, both in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043 at [23], and <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 73 at [28], is for the court to make a “rough and ready” approximation.

Less $280,000 worth of rental income over eight years which went towards defraying the purchase price, he contributed $370,000 (34%) compared to her contribution of $450,000 (41%). His payments included cash, mortgage repayments and rental deficit financing; the rental income fell below the mortgage payments in certain years. Therefore, it was untrue that the wife had made substantial direct contributions to the acquisition of the Flame Tree Park property during the marriage. While she worked early in the marriage and utilised the sale proceeds of her Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat and CPF monies, she could not have sustained the purchase and loan repayments on her own dime.

The wife also said she was in charge of leasing the property at Clementi Woods, liaising with the agents for the tenancy and handling all aspects of the property maintenance. She performed the household duties and took care of the family even after discovering the husband’s adultery in late 2013.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40  Regarding the indirect contribution ratio, I considered that this was a near 20-year marriage, during which the husband was based in Malaysia from 2000 to 2006, and 2010 to 2013. The wife was the primary caregiver to the child, who had an anxiety disorder and experienced difficulties in school. On the husband’s end, it was not disputed that his indirect financial contribution was generous. He also contended that he came home on the weekends diligently, and did focus on the son. That had to be taken into account. However, apart from the husband’s explanation of his indirect financial contributions, his case on his non-financial contribution was largely negative; he sought to downplay the wife’s non-financial contribution instead of demonstrating his own. In any event, I found that the wife had indeed played a significant role in caring for the family and household over the years. If ascertaining the parties’ direct financial contributions requires “rough and ready approximation”, determining the parties’ indirect contributions is all the more so an exercise in “broad strokes” (<span class="font-italic">ARY</span><span class="font-italic"> v ARX </span>at [55]).

The third stage of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> approach is to consider if adjustment of the ratios should be made. I did not consider it necessary to adjust the weightage of the ratios: while the pool of assets was rather large, the marriage was also a long one and the wife’s indirect contribution was substantial as well. In <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK</span> it was envisaged (at [29]) that adjustments might be made to account for any adverse inference drawn regarding a party’s non-disclosure and it was to this issue I next turned. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Proceeds from share crystallisation in 2013</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The main plank of the dispute arose from the wife’s request that the court draw an adverse inference against the husband for his failure to substantiate the whereabouts of some $6.96m in proceeds from the crystallisation of his shares in the company in 2013. The wife alleged that pursuant to the takeover of the company, he liquidated some 800,000 shares in the company at $8.70 per share, thereby reaping the $6.96m in sale proceeds. The wife was willing to concede that the husband paid about $700,000 in August/September 2014 for the final payment of an apartment in Bedok Reservoir Road, Waterfront Gold.

He paid tax of $860,000 for the year of 2013. Based on this, he calculated that the gains from the share sale were $4.7m. Further, the husband explained that the $4.7m had been fully converted into other assets and should not be double-counted by including the sum in the asset pool. Broadly speaking, the husband had an investment plan which involved converting share proceeds into progress payments and/or bank investments to pay for the progress payments of the various properties. This ensured that no mortgage loans need be taken. But where it came to the granular aspects of the investment plan, the husband did not provide a clear picture of what the share proceeds – even just for the $4.7m in capital gains – subsequently went into. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 To summarise, the husband made a series of assertions in relation to the $4.7m in gains from the shares:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) He invested the balance of his gains of about $4.7m in notes and bonds through his investments accounts with Citibank.

A substantial portion of the balance funds were put into his Citibank investment accounts (and invested into bonds and notes) and into savings accounts, all of which totalled $4.3m. This was in order to “pledge them to meet his liabilities for the properties (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) purchases rather than allow them to sit in the accounts”. Therefore, the money had not been dissipated or hidden from the wife.

Even focusing only on the husband’s $4.7m in capital gains, it was not possible to definitively trace the purported flow of these funds into the properties or the investments made through the bank accounts.

</div> But this was merely a snapshot as it was based on a monthly statement from the bank. More documentation might have shown that the share proceeds from 2013 had indeed been used to acquire these various securities which were reflected as being held in 2014. The husband explained that the proceeds were used to pay the progress payments for the property in Bedok Reservoir Road and two properties in Punggol. As mentioned above, the wife was willing to concede that he paid about $700,000 in August/September 2014 for the final payment of the Bedok Reservoir apartment. In regard to the Punggol properties, the husband exhibited emails in November 2014 that showed details of the progress payments and a statement of the transaction particulars.

</div> This suggested that the husband bought the Punggol apartments in 2013. The husband said that he used about $3.6m of the capital gains “from the sale of my [company] shares and other shares” to buy bonds and structured notes through his Citibank investment accounts to finance the payments for the two Punggol properties. Thereafter, he paid a total of $314,000 to the developers, bringing the payments to 30% of the purchase price in the two properties.

As will be recalled, the husband exhibited a statement of account from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) to show that in July 2013, he paid tax of $860,000 on share options gain in 2013. He said that this “imputes … a gain of $4.7 Million at 17% income tax bracket on all the gains made”.

</div> If the gains of $4.7m were made in 2013, would it then include the sum he earned in 2012 from the prior sales, which presumably he would say was put somewhere into the pool? There was little to rely on to ascertain exactly how much he earned from the prior sales of shares before the company take-over and whether those proceeds indeed went into properties such as the initial payments for the two Punggol properties and Clementi Woods, which was bought in 2006 and legally completed in 2010. He had said that the last-mentioned unit was funded over time through the proceeds of his earlier exercise of share options and savings between 2004/5 and 2010, amounting to $1.6m.

</div> The various investments in this account included notes and securities. However it is unclear if the money that was used to acquire these investments came solely from the capital gains in 2013. For one, the bank account statement for September 2014 did not indicate when each of the securities in the fixed income securities account was acquired. At least for some of the investments, they were acquired in mid-2014 or around that time, representing a significant time gap from the time the capital gains were made in 2013. For example, “2.5Y SGD CFMHI … DUE 10JAN2017” was stated as having a transaction date of 16 June 2014.

</div> As another example, “Banyan Tree Holdings Ltd 4.875% due 3 June 2019” was presumably issued only on 3 June 2014. There were also securities that were presumably issued in 2012, which might lead one to suppose that the husband bought these securities on the secondary market in 2013 using his capital gains arising from the take-over.

</div> Capital reductions are accompanied by cash distributions as these are essentially returns of a part of the company’s paid-up capital to its shareholders. This suggested that he might have received some cash distributions beyond the $4.7m capital gains.

</div> It was unclear how such monies factored into the husband’s explanations or whether they were simply unaccounted for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56  From the documents, it was clear that the husband was a savvy investor. It was extremely unlikely that an investor capable of hedging his investments would not have proper accounts or a convenient spread sheet of his activity that showed the inflows, outflows and the chronology of the various transactions. An investor who was able to match the timing of the returns of his various securities with the progress payments as they fell due must surely be able to account for the sale proceeds he had received from share sales, whether these proceeds arose before or after the company take-over, and substantiate where the proceeds went. This was even more so as I noted that for his securities investments, he had indicated that his risk profile was “very aggressive”, meaning he had a high risk tolerance.

</div> To such a “high-risk, high returns” investor, proper records would have been crucial and must have existed. Alternatively, if the husband had adduced the bank statements the wife had requested, an accountant could have been tasked with the effort of making sense of his explanations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 From the various strands, it was clear that there was some inflow or leakage of funds that the husband did not want to reveal. At the same time, I recognised that using the $5.4m figure – the liquidated sum proposed by the wife to be put into the asset pool – would result in substantial double-counting, as he was, to some extent, actively investing in assets which were also within the asset pool. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3)  Giving effect to the adverse inference</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There are at two methods of dealing with an adverse inference. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</span> [2015] 2 SLR 195 at [64], the Court of Appeal reiterated that there were at least two alternative approaches to give effect to the adverse inference drawn against a spouse, both of which it had endorsed in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span>. One approach is for the court to add a specific sum based on the value of the undisclosed assets on the available evidence. The other was to award a higher proportion of the known assets to the other party, an uplift approach. In the present case, the facts disclosed asset leakage rather than a specific liquidated sum that was not disclosed. Thus, the wife’s suggested $5.4m was too large a figure. I considered it more just and equitable to use the uplift approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The cases using an uplift approach cover a broad range. Uplifts ranging as high as 20% are not unprecedented. In <span class="font-italic">Au Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo</span> [2007] SGHC 150, the High Court upheld the decision of the district judge who increased the wife’s share from 50% to 70% on account of husband’s failure to give full and frank disclosure of his assets (at [45]). In <span class="font-italic">Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</span> [2011] 4 SLR 875, the wife was awarded a further 10% of the value of the disclosed assets of $10.95m (at [52]). Therefore, the wife was awarded 30% (after the adverse inference drawn against the husband for failure to disclose material facts) of all the remaining assets save for the matrimonial property, which was divided separately. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In family cases, the facts differ greatly from case to case. In the present case, I adopted a comparatively conservative uplift because of two other factors. The first was that the husband was the main architect of a substantial asset pool. The second was that the share crystallisation represented the husband’s gains from an extended period of work. He would have been about 44 when he married the wife. With the wife’s encouragement, he joined the company as a senior executive, building upon his prior resume. He owned, at that time, a house in Kingsmead Road, which was sold for $4m in 1998; its proceeds went into Chiltern Drive.

The wife’s request rested on her son’s easy access to school from the home. I thought it fair that this property be transferred to the husband. In any event the son was old enough to manage travel time and adjustment to a new home. The husband, on his part, offered to defer the transfer for three years and to allow the wife and the son to reside at Chiltern Drive for the next three years, the estimated period of the son’s present course of instruction.

She asserted that there was no issue of affordability on the part of the husband, who, while claiming he would no longer be employed from September 2016, had not produced the employment contract for his “advisor” and “consultant role” in the company. Despite the husband’s age, he still had “countless” years ahead of him in “advisory positions on Boards and Directorships”.

In the present case, I was of the view that a lump sum payment allowed a clean break between the parties and would not cripple the husband financially. However, it should not be as high as suggested by the wife. The husband, who was already on a post-retirement consultant status, would turn 65 soon and his contract would expire in September 2016. Taking into consideration her sizable share from the asset division and the wife’s ability to earn rental income from her properties, it would be sufficient and appropriate to set a lump sum that will enable the wife to iron out any transitional difficulties. Taking into consideration that $10,000 over a 12-month period would give a sum of about $120,000, the lump sum was set, in the round, at $120,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Maintenance for the son </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The son’s expenses were set out as $7,662 per month and the wife asked for $6,000 a month. Having regard to the reasonableness of the expenses set out, I set the maintenance for the son at $5,000 a month. Regarding the son’s future tertiary education needs, there was insufficient evidence to settle that issue. I envisaged that, within the rubric of the joint custody order, the son would discuss the issue with his father when there was sufficient information and certainty. I noted that the father had thus far provided amply for his son: in his submissions, he also volunteered to ring fence $250,000 of his own assets for the son’s future tertiary education.
