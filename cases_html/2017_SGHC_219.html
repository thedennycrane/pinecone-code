She has stopped riding a motorcycle since the accident, allegedly because she has developed a phobia towards it.

The plaintiff’s counsel submitted that for the pain and suffering and loss of amenities that the plaintiff endured and continues to endure for the degloving injury to her left foot, a sum of $90,000 should be awarded. In support, the plaintiff cited <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wee v Tan Chin Seng</span> [2013] SGHC 54 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wee</span>”). The plaintiff there claimed against the defendant for injuries he suffered when the defendant’s lorry collided into the plaintiff’s motorcycle. The plaintiff suffered, amongst other injuries, a degloving injury to his right foot. The judge affirmed the figure of $90,000 awarded by the court below for pain and suffering. Thus in the present case, the plaintiff submitted that she was entitled to the same sum as her degloving injury was similar to, if not more serious than, that of the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wee</span>.

</div> Nonetheless, I will still address the defendant’s submission on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The defendant relied on the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span><span class="font-italic">(by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong</span> [2012] 2 SLR 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span>”). That case concerned a plaintiff who suffered severe traumatic head injuries. In deciding the appropriate award for pain and suffering, the High Court judge considered cases of other paraplegic claimants. Thereafter, he reduced the Assistant Registrar’s global award of $285,000 for pain and suffering to $160,000 on the basis that $285,000 was manifestly excessive. The Court of Appeal agreed with the judge’s reduced award. It was argued that the plaintiff in the present case did not suffer injuries that were comparable to those of the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>at all, since she could still ambulate and manage her own affairs independently. Thus, the defendant submitted that the award in the present case should not even be near the $160,000 awarded in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span>.

In my view, the comparison with <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span> is not helpful or appropriate. The better starting point is<span class="font-italic"> Ng Chee Wee</span> as the plaintiff there suffered a very similar injury to the plaintiff in the present case. I should point out that no amputation was involved for the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>despite which he was awarded $90,000 for pain and suffering. The judge there also referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">Mei Yue Lan Margaret v Raffles City (Pte) Ltd</span> [2005] SGHC 168 in which the plaintiff was injured by a metal sheet that cut her right leg and caused her to sustain nerve injury.

It bears repeating that the plaintiff suffered very serious injuries and the amputation of her toes is irreversible; the digits cannot be replaced.

Consequently, a global award of $40,000 for the entire crush injury would be manifestly inadequate.

Consequently, based on prevailing case authorities, the defendant submitted that an award of $5,000 was fair and reasonable for the plaintiff’s lower back pain and possible onset of lumbar spondylosis.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  I will first address the claim for the chronic/permanent left foot pain. It will be recalled that the defendant submitted that any sum to be awarded in respect of this was subsumed in the award of $40,000 he offered for pain and suffering for the crush injury of the left foot (see [24] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The court is mindful that a plaintiff should not make a double recovery with regards to pain and suffering. In this case, the issue is whether there should be a separate award to the plaintiff for the permanent pain in her left foot, over and above the award of $90,000 for her pain and suffering as set out in [28] above. The answer is yes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The award for pain and suffering not only compensates an accident victim for the pain the person suffers arising from the accident but covers the residual or permanent pain that the person will have to endure for the rest of his life due to the residual injuries he suffers. It bears noting that the plaintiff’s chronic left foot pain and compensatory pain in the right foot and back will never go away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Consequently, the plaintiff is entitled to claim separately for the pain she suffers in her left and right feet as well as in her lower back caused by the amputation of her two left toes and her resultant uneven gait. As for the amount, the sums should be: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $25,000 for the plaintiff’s permanent left foot pain;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $5,000 for the compensatory pain in her right foot;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $10,000 for the plaintiff’s lower back pain; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) $5,000 for the possible development of lumbar spondylosis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The above figures are in line with the recommendations in the State Courts Guidelines. For the item at [48(a)] above, I took into consideration two ranges stated in the State Courts Guidelines. The first range was $15,000 to $25,000 for serious foot injuries that included “significant damage to both feet requiring multiple operations with some needing fusion of foot joints and long-term treatment” and “residual disabilities remain on a long-term basis with a significant risk of osteoarthritis”. The second range was $25,000 to $30,000 for severe foot injuries including “fractures of both heels/both feet with substantial restriction on mobility and permanent pain”. An award of $25,000 is the maximum of the first range (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for serious foot injuries that have a significant risk of osteoarthritis), but at the lower end of the second range (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for severe foot injuries that cause permanent pain). Consequently, an award of $25,000 would in my view be appropriate. The plaintiff will have no respite from the pain in her left foot because of her occupation as a physiotherapist be it part-time or full-time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for the item at [48(b)] above, the State Courts Guidelines gave a range of $2,000 to $8,000 for mild foot injuries with complete or near complete recovery that has “continuing symptoms such as permanent limping (slight) pain or ache”. Based on the recommended range, I felt an award of $5,000 would suffice. I note that the defendant’s figure of $2,000 was the lowest figure in the range, which in my view is wholly inadequate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As for the item at [48(c)] above, I considered the State Courts Guidelines’ recommended range of $10,000 to $17,000 for “severe strain of the back ligaments and/or muscles giving rise to backaches, soft tissue injuries resulting in exacerbation of existing back condition or prolapsed discs and/or permanent or chronic disability”. In my view, an award of $10,000 – at the lower end of the range – is appropriate. The defendant’s figure of $5,000 is unsupported by either case law or the State Courts Guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, as for the item at [48(d)] above, I note that neither GATOD nor the State Courts Guidelines covers this item. In light of existing case law, an award of $5,000 for the possible development of lumbar spondylosis would not be unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(g): Left shoulder contusion/supraspinatus tendonitis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Dr Tan’s report dated 18 December 2013 (“Dr Tan’s first report”) stated that the plaintiff suffered a left shoulder contusion at the time of the injury.

Her condition would also be easily resolved with proper psychological help.

The plaintiff/respondent in that case was coincidentally a physiotherapist who worked full time at an Adelaide Hospital in South Australia. She was in Singapore on a holiday when she met with an accident. As a result of the accident where the defendant’s/appellant’s car mounted the pavement and collided into her, the plaintiff sustained a fracture to the base of her skull, fractures to her right leg, severe degloving of her right foot/lateral ankle and multiple bruises and lacerations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The plaintiff cited <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian </span>(at [37]) for the following proposition:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The fact of the matter was that [the plaintiff] was under disabilities, and could not, for example, work long hours, attend to patients in wards, and physically assist patients. To suggest that these negative factors would not make the [plaintiff’s] risk of losing her post-accident employment a real risk would be to ignore the obvious. … There was clearly some degree of uncertainty regarding the [plaintiff’s] post-accident employment that could not be disregarded. That said, if the [plaintiff] was to be compelled to re-enter the labour market, her disabilities would, no doubt, put her at some disadvantage. Accordingly, we were of the view that an award for loss of earning capacity was justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff suggested that like the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span>, given her limited physical abilities and the fact that she is placed in a physically strenuous and demanding work environment as a physiotherapist, there was a degree of uncertainty regarding her post-accident employment that could not be disregarded. The plaintiff referred to medical reports that purportedly support the conclusion that the plaintiff is unable to sustain her work as a full-time physiotherapist. I shall return to these reports later. It was also submitted that the plaintiff’s severe residual disabilities would also disadvantage her in the open employment market in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The plaintiff also relied on several case authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Bernice Amelia Tan </span><span class="font-italic">v Loh Chee Song </span>Suit No. 46 of 2000, the plaintiff was a university undergraduate who used to earn $3,000 per month giving tuition and doing freelance photography assignments. Her leg injuries resulted in, among other disabilities, the shortening of her right lower limb and weakened right thigh. The court awarded her $60,000 for the loss of earning capacity. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Hoe Hiong (an infant) suing by her father and next friend Ong Ah Eng v Ang Kok Wei &amp; Ors</span> Suit No. 1425 of 1996, the court awarded $65,000 to the plaintiff who was employed as a sales assistant earning about $1,000 per month, and who suffered injuries to her lower limbs. Finally, in <span class="font-italic">Ong Zern Chern Phillip v Wong Siang Meng </span>[2004] SGHC 256, the plaintiff was a tank commander earning $2,800 per month. He suffered injuries to the lower limbs which made it difficult for him to squat, run, jump and carry heavy weights. The court awarded $80,000 for loss of earning capacity. None of these cases involved amputations. Relying on these authorities, the plaintiff suggested that an award of $75,000 would be appropriate, taking into account the fact that her current income surpasses that of all three plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendant also relied on <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span>, but for a different proposition. At [36], it was stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is trite that an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff is currently employed) can only be awarded if there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market … Following from this, no award for loss of earning capacity should be granted if there is no risk of the [plaintiff’s] post-accident employment being terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The test is two-stage: first, the court determines whether there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff will lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life; and if so, then the court assesses and quantifies the present value of the financial damage which the plaintiff will suffer if that risk materialises, having regard to, among other factors, the degree of the risk and the time when it may materialise. However, if the court determines at the first stage that there is no risk of the plaintiff losing his present job before the end of his working life, the plaintiff is not entitled to an award for loss of earning capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The defendant accepted that there was a risk that the defendant might lose her job at KTP Hospital before the estimated end of her working life and thus that the plaintiff was entitled to an award for the loss of earning capacity. However, the defendant said that this risk was not imminent and thus disputed the quantum to which the plaintiff was entitled. He submitted that an award of $50,000 was fair and reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The defendant pointed to the following facts. First, the plaintiff’s work performance was satisfactory. She had been graded “B” in her work performance evaluations from 2011 to 2016 (save for 2013 after the accident when she had to take an extended break from her work and received a “C” grade).

Even then, she submitted that she could have been re-employed up to 67 years of age, relying on Section 4 of the Retirement and Re-employment Act (Cap 274A, 2012 Rev Ed) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Minimum retirement age</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in any other written law, contract of service or collective agreement, the retirement age of an employee shall be not less than 62 years or such other age, up to 67 years, as may be prescribed by the Minister.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Consequently, the plaintiff was of the view that she could continue working until she turned 67 years of age, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, another<span class="font-italic"> </span>31 years. The plaintiff then relied on <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span>, where the plaintiff was similarly a young female physiotherapist with an estimated 31 years of working life ahead and the court applied a multiplier of 16 years.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Accordingly, the plaintiff submitted that 16 years was an appropriate multiplier for the present case. Applying a split multiplier (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 10 and 6 years for the first and second multiplicands respectively), the plaintiff’s claim for loss of future earnings was $346,968. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The defendant on the other hand submitted that the plaintiff was not entitled to any loss of future earnings. He asserted the plaintiff had failed to prove that she <span class="font-italic">could not</span> work as a full-time physiotherapist and thus her part-time employment at KTP Hospital was not a true reflection of her earning power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As mentioned at [88]–[92] above, I agree with the defendant that the plaintiff can be employed as a full-time physiotherapist whether at KTP Hospital or elsewhere. Consequently, the court does not award the plaintiff the amount she claims for loss of future earnings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The court holds that the plaintiff can and should continue working as a full-time physiotherapist on an outpatient basis. In view of Singapore’s aging population and the increasing life expectancies of both men and women coupled with the increased demand for physiotherapy, the likelihood of her working until she is past 60 years of age is almost a certainty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 However, that does not detract from the fact that the plaintiff’s promotion prospects have diminished as a result of the accident. That being the case, she is entitled to some claim for loss of future earnings. The only issue the court must determine is the quantum of that loss, based on her working on a full-time basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Rather than take the multiplicands used by the plaintiff, the court prefers to accept as a yardstick the plaintiff’s last drawn salary of $4,443 during her full-time employment. Subtracting employer’s CPF contributions, her net salary as of September 2016 working full-time was $3,797 (see [74] above). The court accepts that as a Bachelor of Science graduate in physiotherapy above 30 years of age, the plaintiff could have earned up to $4,800 per month (see [0] above). Adopting a broad brush approach, the plaintiff’s loss in salary in future due to her disabilities would have been around $1,003 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $4,800 less $3,797), rounded down to $1,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As for the multiplier, I accept the plaintiff’s argument at [98] above that the expected remaining work life of the plaintiff is 31 years. Based on <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the appropriate multiplier is 16 years. Therefore, the plaintiff’s total loss of future earning over 16 years would be $192,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $1,000 x 12 months x 16 years).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Future medical expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The plaintiff originally claimed $42,732.60 based on the following breakdown:
