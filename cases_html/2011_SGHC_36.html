<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case illustrates how the
                    “infringement-validity dichotomy” provides an incentive to
                    patentees to make claims for no more than monopolies over more than what was
                    actually invented. I find the following passage in Bently and Sherman, <em>Intellectual Property Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> ed, 2009) (“Bently and
                    Sherman”) useful in explaining this dichotomy (at p 360):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the scope of the monopoly is determined by what is claimed in the
                        patent, the applicants may be tempted to claim more than they perhaps ought.
                        At the same time, however, applicants need to be mindful of the fact that,
                        if they draft claims too broadly, this increases the chance of the patent
                        being declared invalid (primarily for lack of novelty). As matters of
                        infringement and validity are heard in the same tribunal, the
                        infringement-validity dichotomy helps to ensure that the scope of the patent
                        monopoly corresponds to what was actually invented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where the scope of a claimed invention fails to correspond to what was
                    actually invented, in that the patent claim is far broader than that which has
                    actually been invented, the patentee runs the risk of its patent being the
                    subject of invalidation proceedings. In invalidation proceedings, courts should
                    be mindful of attempts on the part of patentees to restrict the width of their
                    patent claims by focusing the court’s attention on the actual invented
                    product after realising that their patent claims had been drafted far too
                    broadly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Dien Ghin Electronics (S) Pte
                    Ltd, brings this suit against the defendant, Mr Khek Tai Ting (trading as
                    Soon Heng Digitax) for the revocation of a registered patent granted to the
                    defendant, Singapore Patent No 89534, and a declaration that the plaintiff has
                    not infringed the defendant’s patent. The defendant counterclaims against
                    the plaintiff for the infringement of the defendant’s
                patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Between 1968 to sometime in 1974, the defendant
                    was employed as an employee in a company involved in the “taxi
                    business”. Sometime in 1974, the defendant worked for his brother-in-law
                    in Soon Heng Taximeters, which manufactured taximeters. The defendant avers that
                    prior to 2000, taxi drivers had to manually control the taxi rooftop displays
                    and that sometime in the year of 2000, he had thought of the idea of displaying
                    the hiring status of a taxi by way of a display panel mounted on top of a taxi
                    which was controllable from within the taxi. He avers that he had also thought
                    of the idea of using a panel comprising many multicoloured Light Emitting Diodes
                    (“LEDs”) mounted on the rooftop of taxis to give a distinct
                    display signal which is visible both in the day and at night. The defendant was
                    of the view that a panel of multicoloured LEDs would allow passengers to see the
                    messages displayed, in relation to whether the taxi was available for hire, with
                    much greater clarity. The defendant decided to patent his invention. On
                    1 September 2000, the defendant set up his own sole proprietorship, known
                    as Soon Heng Digitax. On 4 October 2000, the defendant, with the help of
                    patent agents, submitted an application for patent registration. On
                    30 April 2004, Singapore Patent No 89534 was granted to the defendant. The
                    patent relates to a “transportation status display
                system”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in 2003, the plaintiff began
                    manufacturing taximeters, and has since then been manufacturing taximeters for
                    sale to three taxi fleet operators, namely, Premier Taxis, SMART Taxis and Prime
                    Taxis. The plaintiff avers that it was only sometime in 2007 that the plaintiff
                    also imported and supplied systems for displaying messages on panels of
                    multicoloured LEDs mounted on the rooftop of taxis to the same three taxi fleet
                    operators. The defendant was unable to controvert this averment, or state when
                    he had begun to notice that the plaintiff’s product had been marketed in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       However, as early as 16 January 2006, the
                    defendant’s patent agent, Ella Cheong Spruson &amp; Ferguson (Singapore)
                    Pte Ltd sent a letter to the plaintiff on the defendant’s behalf stating
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our client understands that your company makes or imports for disposal a
                        product, which is highly likely to fall within the scope of the inventions
                        claimed in the [defendant’s patent].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our client requests that you refrain from further making or importing for
                        disposal of the [p]roducts within Singapore and, within 10 days from the
                        date of this letter, undertake that in future you will not make or import
                        for disposal any product falling within the claims of the [p]atent in
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 28 November 2008, the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors wrote to the defendant’s patent agent, stating that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Among other things, our client’s products do not comprise of
                            “<em>a communication means for communicating
                            information regarding the status of the transportation means between the
                            logic controller and the remote information source; wherein the remote
                            information source is a central center [sic] for monitoring and
                            controlling the movement of transportation means</em>” in
                        Claim 1 of the [p]atent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our client therefore seeks acknowledgement from your clients that the
                        manufacture, disposal or offer to dispose of, importation, use or keeping of
                        any of its products does not infringe any claim or claims of the Patent. Our
                        client requires this acknowledgement by close of business on Wednesday, 3
                        December 2008, failing which it shall apply to the High Court for a
                        declaration to this effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In that event, our client also reserves its right to apply to invalidate
                        and/or revoke the Patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When the plaintiff’s solicitors received no response to this
                    letter, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote a further letter to the
                    defendant’s patent agent on 13 March 2009, requesting for a response
                    by 17 March 2009. The defendant’s patent agent then responded on
                    19 March 2009, requesting that correspondence relating to contentious
                    matters be directed to Messrs Jacob Mansur &amp; Pillai, the defendant’s
                    solicitors, which the plaintiff wrote to on 19 March 2009. Several letters
                    were exchanged between the plaintiff’s solicitors and the
                    defendant’s solicitors thereafter. The plaintiff, failing to obtain the
                    confirmation which it had sought in these letters, brought the present suit for
                    first, a declaration that it had not infringed the defendant’s patent, and
                    secondly, an order that the defendant’s patent be revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The patent claims and description</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant’s patent specification
                    contains a brief summary of the problem which the defendant’s patented
                    invention was intended to solve, and it reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Presently, passengers who wish to hail taxis from a distance and in
                        daylight are not able to tell whether the taxis have been hired or are
                        available for hire until the taxis approach or become closer to the
                        passengers. This situation, however, does not pose a problem for passengers
                        at night since the passengers can determine whether the taxis are available
                        for hire by looking at, for example, the lighted display panels mounted on
                        the rooftops of the taxis. The rooftop lighted display panels are usually
                        visible to the passengers from a distance in the dark, as opposed to being
                        less visible in daylight due to poorer contrast conditions. Moreover, the
                        rooftop lighted display panels are usually changed manually for displaying
                        different signs for reflecting the different hiring status of the taxis.
                        Therefore, taxi drivers are usually required to carry different exchangeable
                        rooftop display panels in the taxis and to stop driving, therefore halting
                        operations, when exchanging the rooftop display panels.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Hence, there is a need for a system for displaying
                            information indicating the hiring status of a taxi, or the status of
                            other similar transportation means, in which such displayed information
                            is visible from a distance both in daylight and in the dark, and
                            variable according to the hiring status of the taxi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendant in its patent claims a monopoly in
                    relation to both a product and a process which goes beyond solving the existing
                    problem of poor visibility of rooftop display signs as stated in the
                    defendant’s patented invention. Two independent claims of the
                    defendant’s patent specification read as follows:</p>

                    it is common ground between the plaintiff and the defendant that Claims 1 and 13

<p class="Judg-1">Thus, reading the main claims of the defendant’s patent
                    specification in isolation from the rest of the specification, it appears that
                    the defendant’s invention is a system which allows a remote control centre
                    to monitor and control the movement of transportation means through a
                    communication means. Display and logic controllers control the status messages
                    displayed on multicoloured displays mounted on the transportation
                means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The dependent claims of Claim 1 relevant to the
                    present suit are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The system as in Claim 1, further comprising an
                            input device disposed within the transportation means for receiving
                            input from the driver in relation to the status of the transportation
                            means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The system as in any one of the preceding claims,
                            wherein the multi-colored [<em>sic</em>] display is
                            an array of multi-colored [<em>sic</em>] LEDs, each
                            LED being capable of displaying multi-colors [<em>sic</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The system as in claim 3, wherein the display
                            controller controls the array of multi-colored [<em>sic</em>] LEDs in relation to the on-off switching and
                            coloring [<em>sic</em>] of each LED
                        therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The system as in any one of the preceding claims,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    The system as in any one of the preceding claims,
                            wherein the transportation means is a taxi or bus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Claims 14, 15, 16, 17 and 24, which are claims dependent on Claim
                    13, are similar to Claims 2, 3, 4, 5 and 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant’s product actually sold on
                    the market consists essentially of a multicoloured LED taxi rooftop display
                    which is connected to a mobile data terminal installed in the interior of a taxi
                    facing the driver. The mobile data terminal, which is linked to a remote control
                    centre, would display the addresses of customers who have called for a taxi in
                    the vicinity, and taxi drivers may accept the job by pressing a button on the
                    mobile display terminal. Once the taxi driver accepts the call, the remote
                    control centre sends a signal to the logic controller, and the logic controller
                    and display controller will display the words “ON CALL” in red on
                    the rooftop display panel, which is made up of an array of multicoloured LED
                    lights. When the taxi is unoccupied, the word “TAXI” will be
                    displayed in green on the rooftop display. When the taximeter is started by the
                    driver, the taximeter will send a signal to the logic controller in the rooftop
                    display to display the message “BUSY” in red.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s product</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr Lim Kian Wah (“Lim”),
                    the director of the plaintiff, avers that the plaintiff imports for sale a
                    system for the display of messages in relation to the taxi’s availability
                    for hire on a panel of multicoloured LEDs dependent on inputs by a driver by way
                    of pressing certain buttons on a taximeter. Mr Lim avers that unlike the
                    defendant’s invention, the plaintiff’s rooftop display signs are not
                    connected to a remote control centre by a communication means. Lim also states
                    that the messages displayed on the plaintiff’s rooftop displays may only
                    be controlled by the taxi driver through a keypad which is connected to the
                    rooftop display either by a cable or by infrared technology.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendant’s patent registration was procured by
                fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I will first deal with one argument made by
                    the plaintiff for the revocation of the defendant’s patent on the ground
                    of fraud or misrepresentation under ss 80(1)(f)(i) and (ii) of the Act. The
                    plaintiff has pleaded that the registration of the defendant’s patent was
                    obtained by fraud because contrary to the defendant’s statement in its
                    Statement of Inventorship and of Right to the Grant of a Patent filed under the
                    Patents Rules (Cap 221, R 1, 1996 Rev Ed) the defendant was not the
                    inventor of the invention in question. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that
                    the testimony from one Mr Peh Moon Pak (who had worked for the defendant
                    from 1995 to 1998) that the defendant was not a “technical person”
                    and therefore did not have the expertise to invent the invention described in
                    the defendant’s patent was sufficient evidence of fraud or
                    misrepresentation. I am of the view that the plaintiff has not discharged its
                    burden of proving fraud or misrepresentation on a balance of probabilities. The
                    plaintiff’s reliance on the defendant’s evidence that the
                    defendant’s friend, one Mr Ng Geok Hwa, had designed the electrical
                    wiring for the panel of LED lights, the logic controller and the display
                    controller and that the defendant had designed only the exterior casing of the
                    panel of LED lights is also misplaced. The fact that the designing of the
                    system’s circuitry in the actual product was done with the assistance of
                    an electrical engineer did not necessarily mean that the defendant had not been
                    the source of the inventive concept as claimed, <em>ie</em>, that a multicoloured display controlled by logic and display
                    controllers may be (a) mounted on transportation means to display multicoloured
                    visual information on the status of the transportation means, and (b) connected
                    by way of a communication means to a remote control centre for monitoring and
                    controlling the movement of the transportation means. Section 2 of the Act
                    defines an “inventor” to be the “actual deviser of the
                    invention”. A person may be a deviser of an invention as claimed, even
                    though the precise details of how the inventive concept may be realised into a
                    functional product may be worked out by other persons. In <em>Yeda Research and Development Co Ltd v Rhone-Poulenc Rorer International
                        Holdings Inc</em> [2008] RPC 1 Lord Hoffmann said (at
                        [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The word ‘actual’ denotes a contrast with a deemed or
                        pretended deviser of the invention; it means, as Laddie J. said in <em>University of Southampton's Application</em>
                        [2005] RPC 11 [at] [39],
                        the natural person who ‘came up with the inventive concept’. It
                        is not enough that someone contributed to the claims, because that may
                        include non-patentable integers derived from the prior art: see <em>Henry Brothers (Magherafelt) Limited v Ministry of
                            Defence</em> [1997] RPC 693 at 706;
                        [1999] RPC 442 . As Laddie J. said in the <em>University of Southampton</em> case, the ‘contribution must
                        be to the formulation of the inventive concept’...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Turning to the facts of this case, it is apparent that the defendant
                    had been the deviser of the claimed invention, because he was the very person
                    who “came up with the inventive concept”. This was so even though
                    he lacked the capability to design the entire electrical and electronic
                    circuitry which made his invention functional. Accordingly, the plaintiff has
                    failed to prove fraud or misrepresentation on a balance of probabilities. Thus,
                    the defendant’s patent should not be revoked on the ground that its
                    registration had been procured by the defendant’s fraud or
                    misrepresentation. However, I would observe that the mere fact that one has
                    satisfied the test of inventorship, and qualifies as a grantee of a patent, does
                    not necessarily entail that one will have an effective patent granted in his
                    favour. While a person may satisfy the relatively low threshold of inventorship
                    in the sense that he was the first person to think of the inventive concept, the
                    question of whether his invention is a patentable invention is a separate and
                    perhaps more pertinent question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendant’s patent discloses sufficient teaching to
                enable a person skilled in the art to perform the invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I will next deal with the issue of whether the
                    patent specification sufficiently discloses the invention so as to enable a
                    person skilled in the art to arrive at the invention specified in the
                    defendant’s patent claims, and elaborated upon in the patent
                    specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Section 80(1)<em>(c)</em>
                    of the Act provides that a patent may be revoked if the specification of the
                    patent does not disclose the invention clearly and completely for it to be
                    performed by a person skilled in the art. The disclosure given by a patent
                    specification need only be sufficiently clear and complete, such that a person
                    skilled in the art would be enabled to arrive at the patentee’s invention.
                    In this regard, it is instructive to refer to the case of <em>Ng
                        Kok Cheng v Chua Say Tiong</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 326
                        (“<em>Ng Kok Cheng</em>”), where Judith
                    Prakash J construed s 25(4) of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The specification of an application [for a patent] shall disclose
                        the invention in a manner which is clear and complete for the invention to
                        be performed by a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Prakash J, after noting that the words that the invention must be
                    disclosed in a “clear and complete” manner were immediately
                    followed by the words “for it to be performed by a person skilled in the
                    art”, held that (at [49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a clear qualification implying that as long as a person skilled in
                        the art would find the wording of the specification sufficient to enable him
                        to make the invention, it does not matter that the specification does not
                        state every single step that has to be followed in order to make the
                        invention. Thus, the clear meaning of the legislation taken as a whole is
                        that it is sufficient if the specification is clear enough and complete
                        enough and absolute clarity and completeness are not required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In assessing whether sufficient disclosure has been made by a patent
                    specification, a two-step test is applicable. The court should first, ascertain
                    what the invention is, and secondly, ascertain whether the disclosure of the
                    patent is sufficiently enabling for a person with practical interest in the
                    subject-matter of the patent to arrive at the invention after following the
                    directions: <em>Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel
                        Ltd</em> [2005] RPC 9 at [102] – [104], cited with
                    approval in <em>First Currency Choice Pte Ltd v Main Line

                        Choice</em>”) at [61].
                    Whether a patent specification contains sufficient disclosure of an invention
                    which would enable a person skilled in the art to perform the invention depends
                    on the facts of each case: <em>Mentor Corp v Hollister
                        Inc</em> [1993] RPC 7 at 10, cited with approval in
                        <em>Genelabs Diagnostics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur and
                        anor</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 530 (“<em>Genelabs CA</em>”) at [60]. In relation to the two-step test for sufficiency of
                    disclosure, the case of <em>First Currency Choice</em>
                    provides the following guidance (at [62]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The two-stage test as laid out above can be supplemented by two further
                        considerations. First, the specification of the patent must embrace an
                        embodiment of the invention asserted in each of the claims with sufficient
                        particularity to enable the invention to be understood and carried into
                        effect by those in the industry without making further inventions or
                        prolonged study of the matter. The specification must be set out clearly and
                        fairly so that any individual desirous of carrying out the invention may
                        obtain full knowledge of its practical aspects. But, it is not necessary
                        that the specification be so detailed that this notional individual can
                        perform the invention without any trial or experiment at all. Second, the
                        description of the invention should not be unnecessarily difficult to
                        follow, and must not contain any traps or seriously misleading statements
                        which the reader cannot correct...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the authorities are clear that in order for a patent
                    specification to contain sufficiently enabling disclosure of an invention, the
                    specification must set out directions in relation to how a person skilled in the
                    art may, at a practical level, arrive at the invention which is the subject of
                    the patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I note that in interpreting the scope of
                    patent claims, s 113(1) of the Act states that the claims in a patent
                    specification can be interpreted with the aid of the description and any
                    drawings contained in the specification. However, the claims themselves are the
                    principal determinant, and the rest of the specification are merely of
                    assistance in the construction of the claims: <em>Bean

                    2 SLR(R) 116 at [20]. The
                    following paragraph from <em>Merck &amp; Co Inc v Generics (UK)
                        Ltd</em> [2004] RPC 31 (cited with approval in <em>First Currency Choice</em> (above, at [15]) at [23]) is instructive in this regard (at [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of a patent is to convey to the public what the patentee
                        considers to be his invention and what monopoly he has chosen to obtain.
                        These are not necessarily the same. The former is primarily to be found in
                        the specification and the latter is primarily to be found in the
                        claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I also note that the construction of a patent
                    specification should be made from the perspective of a person skilled in the
                    relevant art, which would in the present case be a reasonably skilled engineer
                    who has some expertise and experience in the design and manufacture of transport
                    fleet management systems such as for buses or taxis. Such a person would be
                    capable of following directions, without exercising much imagination or
                    creativity, in assembling a transport fleet management system in which a central
                    control station may by way of a communication means control the messages
                    displayed on a display mounted on the transportation means, through logic and
                    display controllers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Turning now to the defendant’s patent
                    specification, I am of the view that the patent specification is insufficient
                    for such a person skilled in the art to arrive at the invention described by the
                    patent. All that the patent description tells the reader is that the system is
                    to consist of five components, which are the five integers of the product claim,
                    Claim 1. The dependent claims, Claims 2 to 12, merely specify how the components
                    in Claim 1 may be varied or supplemented. For example, the multicolour display
                    may take the form of a panel of LED lights, the communication means may take the
                    form of an infra-red communication means, and the system claimed in Claim 1 may
                    be supplemented by an input device which allows the driver to input data into
                    the system. What the specification does not teach is how this entire system may
                    be assembled by a person skilled in the relevant art to form a functional
                    finished product. The patent specification is devoid of instructions as to how
                    the integers may be connected together, and how the remote control centre
                    monitors and controls the movement of the transportation means through the logic
                    controller and how it manipulates the multicoloured display mounted on the
                    transportation means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The claim in relation to a process in Claim 13
                    of the patent specification similarly suffers from the same defect. Although it
                    purports to describe a process or method of achieving a particular result, it
                    fails to describe sufficiently to a person skilled in the art how the remote
                    control centre monitors and controls the movement of the transportation means
                    through the logic controller and how it controls the multicoloured display
                    mounted on the transportation means through the logic and display controllers.
                    Accordingly, Claims 14 to 24, which are merely dependent claims which specify or
                    vary Claim 13, do not enable a person skilled in the art to perform the
                    invention claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Furthermore, I note that the detailed
                    description of the defendant’s invention is similarly of limited
                    assistance to a person skilled in the art. In the detailed description of the
                    patent, it is stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A feature of the taxi hiring status display system includes the display of
                        messages that consist of texts, graphics, number, symbols, or signals that
                        are prominent or clearly visible in the daylight and at night. Another
                        feature of the taxi hiring status display system includes the display of
                        different colors [<em>sic</em>] at different times on
                        the rooftop display panels of the taxis, thereby leading to the display of
                        messages in multi-colors [<em>sic</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The taxi hiring status display system includes components such as a
                        rooftop display module, which preferably includes an array of light-emitting
                        (LEDs) arranged and mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB), and a display
                        and logic controller with a built-in memory also mounted on a PCB. Each LED
                        in the LED array is capable of displaying multiple or a variety of colors
                            [<em>sic</em>], and the display and logic
                        controller is for controlling the on-off switching and coloring [<em>sic</em>] the LED array at different times under
                        different conditions and for providing the control logic for the display
                        processes described hereinafter. The display and logic controller PCB
                        preferably piggybacks on the LED array PCB, which is in turn preferably
                        mounted on the rooftop display panels of the taxi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The description also states that the word “TAXI” may be
                    displayed in green when a taxi is available for hire, whereas the word
                    “ON CALL” or “BUSY” may be displayed in red when a
                    taxi is not available for hire. When a taxi driver presses a button to start the
                    taximeter, the display and logic controllers will change the message displayed
                    from “TAXI” to “BUSY”. When the taxi driver presses
                    a button to stop the taximeter, the “BUSY” sign will be changed to
                    “TAXI”. The words “CHANGE SHIFT” may also be
                    displayed by the rooftop display of a taxi. The rooftop display is not confined
                    to displaying information relating to the availability of the vehicle and may
                    display other messages, such as route information or even festive
                    greetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In addition, the detailed description states
                    that the taximeter, display and the logic controller transmit data to one
                    another through the following means:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The communication protocols between the taximeter and the display and
                        logic controller include transmit (Tx) protocols for transmitting and
                        retransmitting bitmap logos and texts from the taximeter to the display and
                        logic controller. The communication protocols between the taximeter and the
                        mobile communication/display device include a transmit (Tx) protocol for
                        transmitting the signal, date and time information from the taximeter to
                        receive information from the mobile communication/display device. Such
                        information include [<em>sic</em>] booking information
                        or non-standard bitmap logos and texts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     With regard to the role played by the central
                    remote control centre, the detailed description states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An intelligent processing unit or processor located in a remote call
                        control center send [<em>sic</em>] messages that are
                        displayable on the rooftop display module of the taxi, such as signals,
                        symbols, texts, numbers, or graphics, to the taxi hiring status display
                        system. Such messages can be sent via conventional radio equipment or global
                        positioning systems (GPS). The messages displayable on the rooftop display
                        module can also be controlled and inputted manually by a taxi driver via a
                        taxi meter under certain circumstances. A mobile communication/display
                        device installed in the taxi enables the taxi driver to receive information,
                        such as passenger bookings, from the remote call control center via radio
                        equipment or GPS, to view what is being displayed on the rooftop display
                        module, or to manually manipulate the messages whenever required or
                        necessary...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Predetermined or standard bitmap logos and texts displayable on the
                        rooftop display module are stored in the built-in memory...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Also, although it is not stated in the patent claims, it is stated in
                    the detailed specifications that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the built-in memory, which takes the form of a
                            flash memory device, may also retain information relating to the time at
                            which the taxi-driver starts and stops the taximeter; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the remote control centre prevents the abuse of
                            the “ON CALL” status. It allows the display of the words
                            “ON CALL” on the rooftop display only when a taxi driver
                            responds via an input device on the taxi to the remote control centre
                            indicating that he will accept a telephone booking. Thus, a taxi driver
                            will no longer be able to display the status “ON CALL”
                            without communicating with the remote control centre via a mobile
                            communication/display device. The “TAXI” status and
                            “BUSY” status are controlled by the taxi driver’s
                            starting and stopping of the taximeter.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     While the above extracts (at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>) from the patent describe the features
                    of the defendant’s invention like a product brochure, I am of the view
                    that they do not contain sufficiently enabling disclosures of how the system may
                    be made to work by a person skilled in the art. The present case is thus unlike
                        <em>Ng Kok Cheng</em> (above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>,
                    where Judith Prakash J was dealing with a patent over a “simple
                    mechanical device” which, in her view, a person skilled in the art
                    “should be able to work out... even though not everything is stated in
                    the specification”. Here, we are concerned with a system of displaying
                    information by way of a panel of multicoloured LED lights mounted on top of a
                    transportation means which relies on a communication means to transmit
                    information from a remote control centre for the purpose of monitoring and
                    controlling the movement of transportation means. It is not sufficient in my
                    view for a specification to simply state what an invention can do, without
                    stating, with sufficient detail, <em>how to achieve the functions
                        stated</em>. In this regard, it must be borne in mind that a patent
                    gives the patentee a monopoly over an invention claimed, in exchange for the
                    inventor’s enabling disclosure of what has been invented, so that, after
                    the expiry of the patent, his invention would fall into the public domain so
                    that others may improve on it: see Ng Loy Wee Loon, <em>Law of
                        Intellectual Property of Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Rev Ed,
                    2009) (“<em>Ng Loy Wee Loon</em>”) at p
                    386.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Furthermore, the level of disclosure made is
                    in my view insufficient given that the defendant’s own expert, Mr Yeo
                    Sze Wee, who teaches at the School of Information and Communications Technology
                    at Republic Polytechnic in Computer Programming, Distributed System and
                    Connectivity, Operating System and Networking and Data Communications, which are
                    modules related to computer engineering, has stated in his testimony in court
                    that the defendant’s invention was a complex system because the
                    programming had to be done by a team of engineers. It is helpful to set out at
                    this point a portion of Mr Yeo’s testimony:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Presumably, Mr Yeo was referring to one
                    of the eight diagrams in the specification, which appear to be unhelpful in
                    setting out to a person skilled in the art how to arrive at the invention
                    claimed. The first four and the eighth diagrams are flowcharts which do not
                    demonstrate how the system is to be connected and assembled, or how the
                    “protocol” or “algorithm” allows the control centre
                    to communicate with the display mounted on top of the taxi. For instance, the
                    first diagram of the defendant’s patent specifications is simply a
                    flowchart illustrating that once the taximeter is started, the rooftop display
                    will display the word “BUSY” until the taximeter is stopped and
                    the word “TAXI” will appear on the rooftop display. Likewise, the
                    second diagram is merely a flowchart illustrating that the driver may press a
                    button to display the word “CHARTERED” on the rooftop display,
                    after which a button may be pressed to change the display back to the word
                    “TAXI”. While the fifth diagram illustrates which components are
                    to be connected to other components, the manner of connection is unspecified.
                    Finally, the seventh diagram which shows the front, side and back views of the
                    rooftop display panel is similarly unhelpful in explaining how the
                    defendant’s invention of a transportation status display system as a whole
                    may be created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     More pertinently, I am of the view that
                    nothing in the patent specification teaches what the fifth integer, the control
                    centre, does. All that Mr Yeo could say is that the function of the control
                    centre has been implicitly disclosed by the third diagram to the patent which
                    illustrates the “protocol”, and I set out portions of his

                    plaintiff’s action to revoke the defendant’s patent should be
                    allowed under s 80(1)<em>(c)</em> of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendant’s invention is patentable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Assuming that I am wrong to revoke the
                    defendant’s patent on the basis that the patent fails to sufficiently
                    disclose the defendant’s invention, I now turn to consider the issue of
                    whether the defendant’s invention as described in its patent is a
                    patentable invention. Section 13(1) of the Act provides that an invention is
                    patentable if it:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">is new;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">contains an inventive step; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">is capable of industrial
                        application.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In this case, only limbs (a) and (b) of s 13 are in dispute. I will
                    therefore deal with the issues of whether the defendant’s invention is new
                    and inventive in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Legal Principles – Novelty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In relation to novelty, ss 14(1) to (3) of the
                    Act provide that:</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to
                        comprise all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either,

                        invention been made available to the public (whether in Singapore or
                        elsewhere) by written or oral description, by use or in any other

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The state of the art in the case of an invention to which

                        published on or after the priority date of that invention, if the following
                        conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) that matter was contained in the application for that other patent

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the
                            invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The “state of the art” is defined, in s
                    14(2) of the Act, as any matter that has at the priority date of an invention
                    been made available to the public anywhere in the world. The requirement that
                    disclosure must have been made to the public is satisfied if it has been made
                    available in the public domain, even if no one has inspected the prior
                    publication: <em>Institut Pasteur v Genelabs Diagnostics Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2000] SGHC 53 (“<em>Genelabs

                    (above, at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>. Thus, the main and only consideration in whether the
                    invention in question is new or novel is whether it is or is not already found
                    in the “state of the art” as defined in s 14(2). No mosaicking of
                    the different prior art is allowed when determining the factual question whether
                    or not the invention is already found to be part of the state of the art. If it
                    is, then it is not new or novel. If it is not, then it is to be regarded as new
                    or novel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I note however that the case authorities have
                    formulated a guide to aid in establishing whether an invention is new or novel.
                    This is often referred to as the “reverse infringement test” which
                    helps to determine whether the invention in the patent claim has already been
                    anticipated by prior art, in which case it should not be considered as new or
                    novel. This “reverse infringement test” was set out as follows by
                    Sachs LJ in <em>The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company v The
                        Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company Limited</em>

                    recently cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Mühlbauer AG v Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd</em> [2010]

                    at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the question whether the patentee's claim is new for the purposes of
                        section 32(1)(e) falls to be decided as a question of fact. If the prior
                        inventor's publication contains a clear description of, or clear
                        instructions to do or make, something that would infringe the patentee's
                        claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the
                        patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty, that is
                        to say, it will have been anticipated. The prior inventor, however, and the
                        patentee may have approached the same device from different starting points
                        and may for this reason, or it may be for other reasons, have so described
                        their devices that it cannot be immediately discerned from a reading of the
                        language which they have respectively used that they have discovered in
                        truth the same device; but <em>if carrying out the directions
                            contained in the prior inventor's publication will inevitably result in
                            something being made or done which, if the patentee's patent were valid,
                            would constitute an infringement of the patentee's claim, this
                            circumstance demonstrates that the patentee's claim has in fact been
                            anticipated</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>... If, on the other hand, the prior publication
                            contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner
                            would infringe the patentee’s claim, but would be at least as
                            likely to be carried out in a way which would not do so, the
                            patentee’s claim will not have been anticipated, although it may
                            fail on the ground of obviousness. To anticipate the patentee's claim
                            the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakeable directions to
                            do what the patentee claims to have invented... A signpost, however
                            clear, upon the road to the patentee's invention will not suffice. The
                            prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted his flag at the
                            precise destination before the patentee</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>...For this purpose it is not permissible to combine
                            earlier unconnected publications to show anticipation, for, if
                            combination of earlier unconnected publications is necessary to assemble
                            all the elements of the invention said to have been anticipated, it
                            follows that no one man has previously made the invention and that the
                            combination is novel</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The distinction between the requirement of novelty and the requirement
                    that a patented invention contains an inventive step has been stated succinctly
                    by Lord Hoffman in <em>Synthon BV v SmithKline Beecham Plc
                        (Paroxetine)</em> [2006] RPC 10 at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...it is this requirement that performance of an invention disclosed in
                        the prior art must necessarily infringe the patent which distinguishes
                        novelty from obviousness. If performance of an invention disclosed by the
                        prior art would not infringe the patent but the prior art would make it
                        obvious to a skilled person how he might make adaptations which resulted in
                        an infringing invention, then the patent may be invalid for lack of an
                        inventive step but not for lack of novelty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Thus, a prior art publication which has
                    anticipated the patentee’s patented invention must contain clear and
                    unmistakeable instructions or descriptions, which if followed, would allow a
                    person skilled in the art to obtain a product or process which would infringe
                    the patent, assuming that the patent is valid: see also <em>Merck
                        &amp; Co Inc v Pharmaforte Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 703 at [37] and
                        <em>Genelabs CA</em> (above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) at [24]. A
                    patentee’s claim may also be anticipated by a prior art publication which
                    teaches the achievement of a particular end by several alternative methods, as
                    long as the prior art publication contains clear and unmistakable directions as
                    to the performance of at least one method of achieving that particular end which
                    constitutes a “flag” planted “at the precise destination
                    before the patentee”: see <em>Ranbaxy UK Ltd v
                        Warner-Lambert Co</em> [2006] FSR 14 at [52], upheld by the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Ranbaxy UK Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co</em>
                    [2007] RPC 4 at [40] and
                        <em>Laboratorios Almirall SA v Boehringer Ingelheim
                        International Gmbh</em> [2009] FSR 12 at [212] –
                    [214]. However, if the instructions (or teachings) at a particular intermediate
                    step are unclear and admit of various possibilities of doing or taking that step
                    which could eventually lead to different end results (one of which may be the
                    patentee’s invention as claimed but not the others), then I would regard
                    that more as a signpost along the road that may or may not lead to the
                    patentee’s invention. As such, it may not enable the prior inventor to
                    plant his flag inevitably at precisely the same destination before the patentee,
                    in which case the patentee’s claim cannot be said to have been anticipated
                    by that prior art publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It bears emphasis that the inquiry into
                    whether an invention has been anticipated by prior art is an inquiry which is
                    conducted through the perspective of a person skilled in the art, who is a
                    workman or technician aware of everything encompassed in the state of the art
                    and who has the skill to make routine workshop developments, but not to exercise
                    inventive ingenuity or think laterally: per Laddie J in <em>Pfizer Ltd's Patent</em> [2001] FSR 16 at [62]-[63], cited with approval in <em>First Currency
                        Choice</em> (above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) at
                        [28].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Prior art publications must be construed in
                    the light of the state of knowledge known to readers skilled in the art as at
                    the date of the publication of the prior art and the court must eschew <em>ex post facto</em> analysis of prior art publications in the
                    light of information that had subsequently been made available to the public:
                        <em>Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd v FE Global
                        Electronics Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 389 per Lai Kew
                    Chai J at [87] (affirmed on appeal in <em>FE Global
                        Electronics Pte Ltd v Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 874). The court should also consider prior art publications
                    separately for the purpose of determining the question of novelty, and not
                    mosaic or combine disparate pieces of prior art in order to arrive at the
                    invention which is the subject-matter of the disputed patent: <em>ibid</em>. The construction of the prior art in the light of common
                    general knowledge known at the time of the publication of the prior art to an
                    unimaginative person skilled in the art does not amount to mosaicking of
                    different prior art publications. Therefore, if a prior art document teaches the
                    making of a chair with four legs by attaching each leg onto a corner of the base
                    of the seat, but does not state what materials should be used in the making of
                    the chair, the person skilled in the art may properly interpret the prior art
                    document as teaching the making of a chair with four legs using the materials
                    generally known to be available at the time of publication of the prior art
                    document for making furniture. This does not at law constitute mosaicking two
                    prior art publications, because the knowledge that furniture may be made with
                    wood forms part of the common general knowledge of persons skilled in that art
                    at that time. However if the four legs and the seat of the chair are specified
                    in the invention to be made of a special carbon fibre material, in order to make
                    the whole chair especially light and especially strong to withstand the weight
                    of a very heavy person, then I may regard that invention as new or novel and not
                    part of the state of the art because the use of such a special material is not
                    part of the common knowledge at that time of publication of the prior art of
                    making a chair with four legs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I would add a further observation. In my view,
                    the application of the reverse infringement test is straightforward where the
                    prior art publication and the patent claims are pitched at the same level of
                    abstraction. It is more complicated when the two are pitched at different levels
                    of abstraction. The case of <em>Mühlbauer AG</em> (above at
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>) illustrates this. In that case,
                    the appellant’s claimed invention related to a machine for the
                    simultaneous inspection, picking up and placing of electronic components onto
                    printed circuit boards or tape and reel packaging within a single 180-degree
                    rotation of a two-headed pivoting part of the device. The invention allowed
                    inspection to be conducted by means of a camera mounted on top of a through
                    opening located transversely between the two pickup heads. In the
                    respondent’s earlier version of this product, inspection and picking up
                    was not done simultaneously, and the rotating devices used would typically have
                    more rotating heads, one of which was used to mount the camera. The Court of
                    Appeal stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The present appeal illustrates the very important <em>general</em> point to the effect that no area of the law
                        (including that relating to patents) is exempt from the general principles
                        of logic and rational argument. Indeed, this point is so obvious that it is
                        often taken for granted. In this appeal, it is illustrated ... by the
                        argument by counsel for the Respondent... that, because the use of pick up
                        heads was nothing new and (more importantly) because his client's patents
                        had, in fact, more pick up heads, the Appellant's claim that the Patent was
                        novel and embodied an inventive step must fail. Such an argument is, at
                        first blush, admittedly persuasive. However, it is our view that [the
                        respondent’s counsel] (albeit unintentionally) has pitched the
                        argument on behalf of his client at <em>too high a level of
                            abstraction</em> ... Put simply, whilst the proposition advanced
                        is not factually incorrect, it does not include that degree of specificity
                        which is required under the particular principles embodied in the current
                        law... Indeed, if [the argument of the Respondent’s counsel] is
                        correct, <em>any</em> novelty and/or further inventive
                        step would, literally, be (virtually, if not wholly) <em>impossible</em>. A moment's reflection would reveal that this is
                        incorrect simply because it is <em>always possible</em>
                        for there to be novelty and/or a further inventive step - particularly if we
                        view the inquiry from a <em>qualitative</em> point of
                        view. Everything would depend, in the final analysis, on the particular
                        facts and (more importantly) the impact (if any) that the patent concerned
                        has on the existing state of the art in that particular sphere. Indeed, one
                        of the Respondent's arguments, as we have just seen, centred really on the
                            <em>quantity</em> of pick up heads, rather than (as
                        we think ought to be the case) <em>the overall qualitative
                            difference (if any) between the Patent on the one hand and the patents
                            relied on by the Respondent on the other</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Mühlbauer AG</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>), the patent specifications had described the
                    patent in a very specific manner, and had explained how the invention had
                    achieved the result of reducing the time necessary for the pick-up and
                    inspection of the printed circuit boards. The respondent’s counsel had
                    sought to interpret the description of the invention in the most abstract manner
                    possible, because at a higher level of abstraction, it was more likely to have
                    been anticipated by the prior art. This was held impermissible, because at a
                    high level of abstraction, prior art would easily have anticipated the
                    invention. <em>A fortiori</em>, where the patent document
                    has been pitched at a high level of abstraction by the <em>patent
                        drafters themselves</em>, the court is faced with the task of
                    determining whether the specific (in the prior art) has anticipated the general
                    (in the patent claims). In so doing, the court ought to interpret the prior art
                    at the same level of abstraction expressed by the patent claims, in order for a
                    meaningful comparison between the patent claims and the prior art to be
                    conducted. The result of such a comparison would, as a matter of practice,
                    likely result in the invention being held to have been anticipated by the prior
                    art. This is so regardless of whether the patentee in fact manufactures for sale
                    a much more complex and sophisticated product than the invention claimed in the
                    patent specification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The following hypothetical illustrates the
                    point made in the preceding paragraph. Assume that the state of the art consists
                    of publications which teach in detail the making of hybrid cars which are cars
                    which use two or more power sources to move the vehicle. Subsequently, someone
                    applies to register a patent over a car which is connected to an engine and four
                    wheels. Assume for the moment that the patent for a car with an engine and four
                    wheels is accepted for registration because the hybrid car was not the subject
                    of a pre-existing patent. Subsequently, a hybrid car maker then commences
                    proceedings for the invalidation of the patent on the ground of lack of novelty.
                    In such a situation, the patent ought to be invalidated, because although the
                    performance of the prior art publication will result in a hybrid car which is
                    strictly speaking not identical to the simpler invention claimed in the patent
                    document, the hybrid car would have infringed the patent (assuming that the
                    patent is valid) because it consists of the essential integers of the exterior
                    of the car, an engine, and four wheels. Thus, the proper approach is, in my
                    view, to notionally perform the prior art from the perspective of a person
                    skilled in the art, and then to reduce the notional end product to the same
                    level of abstraction as the patent claims, for the purpose of determining the
                    question of anticipation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Suppose however, that the same patentee,
                    although having chosen to register a patent in such vague terms, actually
                    manufactures a product which is much more sophisticated than a mere car with an
                    engine and four wheels. The patentee’s manufactured product is in fact a
                    hybrid <em>sports</em> car with an extremely efficient
                    engine, which can travel by electrical propulsion at times. Due to the high
                    speed which may be attained by the patentee’s hybrid <em>sports</em> car, its product is distinguishable from normal
                    pre-existing hybrid cars. However, this does not mean that the patent is
                    therefore a valid one. A patentee, in order to avoid or minimise the risk of
                    invalidation of its patent due to anticipation by prior art, ought to claim no
                    more than a monopoly over what was actually invented. The patentee should have
                    registered his patent specifically only for his special high speed and efficient
                    engine and not widen the scope of the claim to such a general level as a car
                    with merely an engine and four wheels. In determining the question of whether
                    the invention claimed in a patent specification has been anticipated by the
                    prior art, the court focuses on the invention claimed in the document, and not
                    on the actual product manufactured by the patentee. Otherwise, the law would
                    provide a <em>carte blanche</em> for inventors to register
                    all manner of patents which claim a wide monopoly over all and sundry to stifle
                    competition. As mentioned in the first paragraph of this judgment, the
                    infringement-validity dichotomy helps to ensure that the scope of the patent is
                    no wider than what has been actually invented. Courts should therefore be
                    critical of attempts by patentees to limit, <em>ex post
                        facto</em>, the scope of their patent claims by conflating their
                    actual manufactured products with their patent claims, in order to avoid
                    invalidation on the ground of anticipation by the prior art.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the defendant’s product is new</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I turn now to the facts of the present case
                    bearing in mind that, according to the Act, one of the prerequisites for
                    patentability is whether the invention in question is in fact
                    “new” or in other words, whether the invention is
                    “novel”. The touchstone of newness or novelty is ultimately an
                    intensely factual inquiry of whether a purported invention has been anticipated
                    by a prior enabling disclosure, which renders the purported invention no longer
                    new or novel. Hence, one should not be over-formalistic and rigidly adhere to
                    the reverse infringement test as a substitute for the question of
                    “newness” or “novelty”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff submits that the

                    existence prior to the priority date of the defendant’s patent, 4 October

<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff’s submission is that the VICOS LIO document, the
                    VDV 300 document, the RTI document, and the TIBS flip-dot cum LED system used by
                    TIBs Mercedes Benz taxis each constitute prior art which contain enabling
                    disclosures of systems for transport fleet management from a remote control
                    centre, and which also comprise external displays which are capable of

<p class="Judg-1">The defendant submits that the VICOS LIO document, VDV 300 document and
                    RTI document do not contain sufficient disclosure, such as to allow a person
                    skilled in the art to arrive at the invention described in the defendant’s
                    patent. In particular, the defendant submits that the VICOS LIO document and the
                    VDV 300 document do not teach that the integer of a multicoloured display
                    mountable on the top of a transportation means may take the form of a display
                    using a panel of multicoloured LED lights. Similarly, the defendant submits that
                    the RTI documents do not anticipate the defendant’s invention because
                    although the RTI document expressly teaches that information may be displayed on
                    stationary LED or liquid crystal display (“LCD”) terminals, there
                    is no express reference in the RTI document to multicoloured LED displays. In
                    addition, all three prior art documents disclose systems for transport fleet
                    control and management, and do not specifically teach that LED display panels
                    may be mounted on taxis (as opposed to other transportation means such as buses)
                    to inform commuters of the availability of taxis for hire. The defendant further
                    submits that the TIBS flip-dot cum LED document was not a document which has
                    been made available to the public and therefore does not amount to prior art
                    within the meaning of s 14(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I will first deal with the preliminary issue
                    of whether the TIBS flip-dot cum LED document forms part of the state of the art
                    as defined by s 14(2) of the Act, as at the priority date of the
                    defendant’s patent. The TIBS flip-dot cum LED document describes the
                    manner of connection of a rooftop display to another component known as the
                    mobile display terminal, <em>ie</em>, through which ports
                    and cables are to be used for establishing the connection. It also discloses the
                    operating software used for communication of output to the rooftop sign and the
                    computing protocol used. In addition, it also discloses that a mobile display
                    terminal should be installed in the taxi to display information to and receive
                    input from the driver. This mobile display terminal then sends a signal to the
                    rooftop sign to change the message displayed according to the driver’s
                    input. This document was adduced through Mr Chong Sin Keong, who had been
                    an employee of TIBS Motors Pte Ltd from November 1991 to 2001. After the company
                    merged with SMRT Corporation Ltd in 2001, Mr Chong worked in the merged
                    entity until April 2008. The TIBS flip-dot cum LED document was prepared in
                    November 1997, by one Mr Trevor Rodgers of an entity known as Sigtec Pty
                    Ltd and an IT executive from TIBs Taxis Pte Ltd as a checklist for the testing
                    of the system during its installation phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mr Chong explained that the TIBS flip-dot
                    cum LED document described the system used by TIBs in 1997, where the flip-dot
                    cum LED displays were installed on the rooftops of a fleet of Mercedes taxis. It
                    was an improvement from an existing system implemented in 1995 on other TIBs
                    taxis, which had the following function: when a taxi was on call, the remote
                    control centre would manipulate the rooftop display sign, to display the message
                    “ON CALL”. Otherwise, the driver’s action of starting and
                    stopping the taximeter on the taxi would manipulate the rooftop sign to display
                    the words “HIRED” or “TAXI” accordingly. Prior to
                    1997, the displays used were a panel consisting of regular arrangement of
                    multiple flip-dots which were approximately 45 degrees from a light source at
                    the side of the panel. These flip-dots reflected light from the light source and
                    sunlight (if available) to enable commuters to see the display. In 1997, these
                    flip-dots were modified and LEDs embedded within each dot were made forward
                    facing so that the light emitted from the LED in each flip-dot would lead to
                    increased visibility of the LED display itself during the night. Mr Chong
                    avers that the modification was done to the system as a result of this change,
                    and the TIBS flip-dot cum LED document was created as a result of this process
                    as a checklist for testing of this new system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In my view, the TIBS flip-dot cum LED document
                    is not part of the state of the art because it had never been made publicly
                    available. Mr Chong was in charge of using the document for the purpose of
                    testing the system. At the trial, he stated that the TIBS flip-dot cum LED
                    document was an internal document accessible by TIBS staff and not the public
                    generally. Therefore, this document did not constitute prior art which this
                    court may have cognizance of. However, I am of the view that the actual physical
                    product, interpreted in the light of what was commonly known to the general
                    public and the users of the TIBS product, <em>ie</em> the
                    taxi drivers, was part of the prior art which this court may have cognizance of.
                    This is not to say that common general knowledge is limited to only knowledge
                    known to members of the public, because common general knowledge refers to
                    knowledge known to a notional person skilled in the art which includes knowledge
                    which may be unavailable to the general public: <em>First

                    light of the evidence given by Mr Chong, I am of the view that the public,
                    or at least taxi drivers (probably constituting a fairly large section of the
                    public) operating the TIBs flip-dot cum LED system (and all the more so, the
                    person skilled in the art) would know quite generally that the taximeter is
                    connected to the rooftop display, which displays different messages depending on
                    the input of the driver of the taxi, and that a control centre may manipulate
                    the rooftop display to show the “ON CALL” sign only when a call
                    has been accepted by a taxi driver. While it is doubtful whether the TIBS
                    physical exhibit, <em>ie</em>, the panel of flip-dot cum
                    LEDs adduced during the trial, also gives sufficient disclosure of the detailed
                    internal working and the detailed electrical and electronic circuitry as would
                    allow a person skilled in the art to create a system identical to the
                    TIBS’ flip-dot cum LED display, the level of disclosure given at the
                    fairly general level based on the manner of use of the system as generally known
                    to the taxi drivers operating the system is to my mind at about the same (level
                    of disclosure) as what has been given by the defendant’s very own patent.
                    I have <em>assumed</em> for the purposes of this discussion
                    that such a level of disclosure is sufficiently enabling. Nevertheless, I am of
                    the view that the TIBS flip-dot cum LED system had not anticipated the
                    defendant’s invention. The TIBS product uses only a monochrome LED
                    display, and does not teach, like the defendant’s patent, that the display
                    ought to take the form of a multicoloured display. Since an essential integer
                    (the multicoloured display) of the defendant’s invention has not been
                    taught by the TIBs prior art, a person skilled in the art performing the TIBs
                    prior art in the light of the common general knowledge at the material time
                    would not arrive at a product which would have infringed the defendant’s
                    patent (assuming that it was validly granted). The person skilled in the art
                    performing the TIBs prior art would still have arrived at a taxi rooftop LED
                    display that was monochrome as the TIBs prior art specifically and explicitly
                    teaches that a monochrome display is to be used and not otherwise, although it
                    may already be common knowledge at that time that multicoloured LED displays are
                    generally available for use as electronic displays.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I now consider the VICOS LIO document, which
                    describes a system developed by the Siemens group of companies (“the
                    Siemens system”), and which was prepared for the purpose of sending to
                    customers of Siemens which utilise the system and to potential customers. The
                    Siemens system was developed for public transportation such as buses and trams,
                    to facilitate the collection and dissemination of information for the benefit of
                    drivers, transport service providers and the general public. The VICOS LIO
                    document states that the Siemens system consists of the following
                    components:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a central control centre which can monitor the

                            relation to the location of the bus and instructions on whether to slow
                            down or increase speed.</div>

                            at individual bus stops which display information such as route number
                            and details, or other information to passengers sent by the remote
                            control centre;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an on-board display which exhibits messages sent
                            to the driver, and a device within the bus which receives input from the
                            driver and communicates that information as well as information in
                            relation to its location and expected time of arrival at a certain bus
                            stop to the remote control centre; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">communication means which transmits data using
                            radio data to computers installed on board the individual buses which in
                            turn control the displays on the buses.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The VICOS LIO document does not expressly
                    state that electronic displays mounted on the exterior of buses are connected to
                    display and logic controllers which control the turning on and off of individual
                    LED lights in the panel of numerous multicoloured individual LED
                lights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, according to the plaintiff, relying
                    on its expert, Mr Brian Higbee’s testimony, the teaching in the VICOS
                    LIO document is that the display could be any form of electronic display, and as
                    multicoloured LED displays were already commonly available in the market at that
                    time, the VICOS LIO prior art clearly entails an instruction that the electronic
                    display panel used may be made up of a multitude of individual LED lights in
                    different colours. Furthermore, since it was common general knowledge among
                    engineers who utilise such display panels that the LED display panel (whether
                    monochrome or multi-coloured) cannot work unless it is connected to display and
                    logic controllers, it goes without saying that display and logic controllers
                    must necessarily be utilised as components of such systems. Thus, according to
                    the plaintiff, persons skilled in the art reading the VICOS LIO document in the
                    light of the common general knowledge at that time would inevitably arrive at
                    the defendant’s invention expressed at the high level of generality as
                    described in the defendant’s patent. I agree with the plaintiff’s
                    expert on this issue. Where it is already common knowledge at the date of
                    publication of the prior art that electronic displays for the purpose of
                    displaying visual information to be read or seen can be either monochrome or
                    multicoloured and when the prior art description does not specify that the
                    electronic display must be monochrome or must be multicoloured but merely
                    stipulates as one of the integers that an electronic display is to be used, I
                    would construe the scope of the prior art to cover both monochrome and
                    multi-coloured electronic displays within that integer. The drafter of the VICOS
                    LIO document must have intended to cover unambiguously both alternatives and not
                    merely the use of a monochrome electronic display to the exclusion of the
                    multicoloured, or the use of a multicoloured electronic display to the exclusion
                    of the monochrome in his inventive concept. Consequently, the VICOS LIO document
                    must have anticipated the use of the either the monochrome or multicoloured
                    electronic display as one of the integers. Thus to my mind, the VICOS-LIO
                    document discloses a system for displaying information on top of a
                    transportation means using monochrome or multicoloured electronic displays.
                    Therefore, it does not constitute a vague disclosure which permits the prior art
                    publication to be performed in other imaginable ways, of which one would but
                    others would not infringe the defendant’s patent, assuming that the patent
                    was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Thus, to my mind, in applying the reverse
                    infringement test to the facts of this case, it would be inappropriate to apply
                    the following portion of Sach J’s pronouncement in <em>General Tire &amp; Rubber</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>), which I set out again in full for convenience:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If, on the other hand, the prior publication contains a direction
                        which is capable of being carried out in a manner would infringe the
                        patentee’s claim, but would be at least as likely to be carried out in
                        a way which would not do so, the patentee’s claim will not have been
                        anticipated, although it may fail on the ground of obviousness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above pronouncement is applicable where the disclosure made by a
                    prior art publication is vague as to or fails to disclose instructions with
                    respect to a particular step or stage of the process of arriving at an
                    invention. Such vagueness or silence would require a person skilled in the art
                    performing the invention to perform the direction by a method not taught by the
                    prior art publication, whether by the exercise of his own creative ingenuity or
                    by incorporating disclosures made by other prior art documents. In so doing, the
                    person skilled in the art might thereby infringe a subsequent patent, assuming
                    that it has been validly granted. However, if the person skilled in the art was
                    to perform the prior art publication in some other manner, such a person might
                    not arrive at an end result which would infringe the same patent, assuming it
                    had been validly granted. It cannot be gainsaid that in such a situation,
                    following the instructions disclosed by the prior art publication would
                    inevitably lead to the infringement of a subsequent patent, because the
                    disclosure made by the prior art publication was vague. In the present case, the
                    VICOS-LIO document clearly and unambiguously teaches the use of an electronic
                    display which to the common general knowledge may take the form of <em>either</em> a monochrome or multicoloured display. The
                    VICOS-LIO document is therefore not the type of prior art document which was
                    within the contemplation of Sachs LJ when he made the above-quoted pronouncement
                    in <em>General Tire &amp; Rubber</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant’s expert, Mr Yeo,
                    also agreed that the specifications teach integers (a) to (d) listed above at
                        <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>. However, Mr Yeo testified
                    that the VICOS-LIO document does not sufficiently disclose to a person skilled
                    in the art how to arrive at the system described in the document, and thus the
                    VICOS LIO document does not constitute prior art for the purpose of s 14(2) of
                    the Act. Further, Mr Yeo stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that
                    the VICOS LIO document does not specifically teach that the electronic display
                    mounted on the buses should take the form of a panel of multicoloured LED
                    display lights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I am of the view that the VICOS LIO document
                    contains directions and a level of detail that is far greater than the
                    defendant’s own patent specification, which I have held to contain
                    insufficient disclosure of the defendant’s invention. For instance, the
                    VICOS LIO document discloses that the control computer servers and the workplace
                    computers are networked locally via Ethernet lines, and that a routing capable
                    network known as TCP/IP must be used. It also teaches that the control computer
                    server and the remote workplace computers (<em>ie</em>, on
                    board buses) need IP addresses. In my view, if I am wrong in holding that the
                    defendant’s patent specification has made insufficient disclosure of the
                    defendant’s invention (which I have assumed to be the case for the purpose
                    of this discussion), the VICOS LIO prior art document, which is not less brief
                    than the defendant’s patent specification, cannot be faulted for
                    insufficient disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I will next address another objection of the
                    defendant’s, which is that the VICOS LIO document does not teach that the
                    display of real-time information from a control centre or the driver’s
                    input via a communication means may be mounted on the <em>rooftop
                        of a taxi</em>. This argument is to my mind wholly unmeritorious.
                    First, there is nothing in Claims 1 and 13 of the defendant’s patent which
                    states that the display must be mounted only on the roof-top and not anywhere
                    else on the vehicle. In fact, the defendant’s patent merely refers to a
                    multicoloured display “mountable” on a transportation means, which
                    therefore permits mounting of the display anywhere on the vehicle. Second,
                    Claims 1 and 13 of the defendant’s patent relate respectively to a system
                    and method for displaying information relating to the status of a
                    “transportation means”, and not specifically taxis. Furthermore,
                    in the defendant’s own specification, he makes the following dependent
                    claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    The system as in any one of the preceding claims,
                            wherein the transportation means is a taxi or bus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Thus, I am of the view that the
                    defendant’s invention has been anticipated by the prior publication of the
                    VICOS LIO document, which teaches that messages sent by a remote control centre
                        <em>via</em> a communication means may be displayed by
                    an electronic display mounted on the buses which must necessarily also
                    incorporate display and logic controllers in order for the display to operate, a
                    fact well known to a person skilled in the art. In particular, although the
                    VICOS LIO document only teaches the use of an electronic display without stating
                    whether such electronic displays include multicoloured LED display panels, it is
                    permissible for a person skilled in the art performing the VICOS LIO prior art
                    to have cognizance of the availability of multicoloured LED displays on the
                    market at the time of the publication of the prior art, which forms part of the
                    common general knowledge. This is not, to my mind, mosaicking disparate pieces
                    of prior art, because the person skilled in the art is merely interpreting the
                    prior art in the light of common general knowledge then available and known to
                    persons like himself. Given that a person skilled in the art following the
                    instructions set out in the VICOS LIO document would arrive at a product which
                    would comprise all the essential integers of the defendant’s invention as
                    claimed, I am of the view that the VICOS LIO prior art publication has
                    anticipated the defendant’s invention as described in the
                patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I now turn to make a comparison between the
                    VDV 300 document and the defendant’s patent. The teachings in the VDV 300
                    document do not differ materially from those of the VISCOS LIO document. Like
                    the VICOS LIO document, the VDV 300 document discloses that the VDV 300 system
                    comprises a remote control centre, a communication means, and an electronic
                    display which is controlled by display and logic controllers. As mentioned
                    previously (above at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>) in relation to
                    the VICOS LIO document, the VDV 300 document likewise teaches the use of an
                    electronic destination display without express mention of the type of electronic
                    destination display, or that the electronic destination display is to be
                    connected to a display and logic controller. For the reasons given earlier for
                    deciding that the defendant’s patent had been anticipated by the VICOS LIO
                    document, the VDV 300 document could also in my view have anticipated the
                    defendant’s invention provided that there is clear evidence that as early
                    as January 1992, the date of publication of the VDV 300 document, it was already
                    common knowledge that multicoloured electronic displays were available for use
                    as displays. Based on the Japanese Patent JP7191616 referred to in <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> below, it would appear that as early as
                    December 1993, there were already multicoloured LED displays. As I do not have
                    sufficient evidence whether it was common knowledge that in January 1992 (some
                    two years before the Japanese Patent JP7191616), multicoloured LED displays were
                    already widely in use, I am not prepared to find that the VDV 300 document
                    (published much earlier in January 1992) had anticipated the defendant’s
                    patent, although I am prepared to accept that by 1999 or 2000, multicoloured LED
                    displays were widely available as electronic displays, a fact that a person
                    skilled in the art would be fully aware of as part of his common knowledge when
                    construing the VICOS LIO document (published much later in November
                    1999).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I turn finally to the RTI document published
                    in June 2000, which was even later than the VICOS LIO document. The teachings in
                    the RTI document are also largely similar to those in the VICOS LIO document,
                    save that the RTI document discloses that a remote control centre may monitor
                    the location and movement of buses using data from a combination of GPS,
                    differential GPS and odometer readings. Like the defendant’s invention,
                    the remote control centre is connected to the rooftop display by way of a
                    communication means. While the RTI document does not expressly teach that the
                    message displayed is controlled by a logic and display controller, it was part
                    of the common general knowledge known to persons skilled in the art at the
                    material time that electronic displays cannot work unless they are connected to
                    a logic and display controller. In particular, I note that the RTI document
                    specifically teaches that the component of a display panel mounted on the
                    exterior of a bus could take either the form of an LED display panel or a LCD
                    screen but does not explicitly state that the display or screen is to be
                    monochrome or multicoloured. Both LED and LCD displays which are multicoloured
                    were already commonly available by the year 2000 and their existence as displays
                    would be well known to persons skilled in the art. Hence, the RTI document
                    should be construed to include the teaching of mounting a multicoloured LED
                    display panel on the exterior of a bus to display messages to inform commuters
                    of the transportation status of the bus. Thus, I cannot accept the
                    defendant’s submission that the RTI document relied upon by the plaintiff
                    did not anticipate the defendant’s invention because it had only taught
                    that the display was to take the form of monochrome LED lights or some other
                    monochrome electronic display, as opposed to a multicoloured LED display, which
                    is an essential feature of the defendant’s invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     While the actual product sold by the defendant
                    to taxi operators such as Comfort utilises a multicoloured LED display, I am of
                    the view that the patent claim is in fact much wider than that. It is claimed as
                    an essential integer of Claim1 that the defendant’s system is to comprise
                    a multicoloured display. It is therefore improper for the defendant to now seek
                    to narrow the scope of its patent claim by focusing the court’s attention
                    on its actual manufactured product. In answering the question of whether an
                    invention is new or novel, the court must have regard to whether the monopoly
                    claimed in a patent specification (and not the patentee’s actual
                    manufactured product) has been anticipated by the prior art. Claim 3 of the
                    patent does specify that the defendant’s invention comprises of an array
                    of multicoloured LED lights, in which each light is capable of displaying
                    multicolours. However, I am of the view that even if a multicoloured LED
                    external display was essential to the defendant’s invention insofar as it
                    achieves the objective of making the display panel visible from afar to
                    commuters, this aspect of the defendant’s invention had been anticipated
                    by the prior art, in particular, the RTI document and is therefore not new. This
                    is because the RTI document had already contained teachings that the electronic
                    display panel may take the form of either a panel of LED lights, or a LCD
                    screen. It would, in my view, occur to a notional person skilled in the art
                    reading the RTI document in the light of the common general knowledge at the
                    material time that the a panel of LED lights includes a panel of multicoloured
                    LED lights. This is hardly surprising, given that at the material time,
                    multicoloured LED displays and multicoloured LCD screens as displays had already
                    been available on the market. In arriving at this conclusion, I have not
                    mosaicked or merged together the various pieces of prior art, which is not to be
                    done when evaluating whether the invention is new. I now proceed to determine
                    the question of whether the defendant’s invention comprised an inventive
                    step.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Legal principles - Inventive Step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Section 15 of the Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Inventive step</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15</b>. An invention shall be taken to involve
                        an inventive step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art,
                        having regard to any matter which forms part of the state of the art by
                        virtue only of section 14 (2) and without having regard to section 14
                        (3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The oft-cited case of <em>Windsurfing International Inc
                        v Tabur Marine (Great Britain) Ltd</em> [1985] RPC 59 sets
                    out a four-step test for what at law constitutes an inventive step
                        (“<em>Windsurfing test</em>”) (at 73
                    – 74):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are, we think, four steps which require to be taken in answering the
                        jury question. The first is to identify the inventive concept embodied in
                        the patent in [the] suit. Thereafter, the court has to assume the mantle of
                        the normally skilled but unimaginative addressee in the art at the priority
                        date and to impute to him what was, at that date, common general knowledge
                        in the art in question. The third step is to identify what, if any,
                        differences exist between the matter cited as being "known or used" and the
                        alleged invention. Finally, the court has to ask itself whether, viewed
                        without any knowledge of the alleged invention, those differences constitute
                        steps which would have been obvious to the skilled man or whether they
                        require any degree of invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the structured approach of the four-stage test is useful in
                    preventing <em>ex post facto</em> rationalisation and helps
                    to maintain consistency in the determination of the question of obviousness, the
                        <em>Windsurfing</em> test is in the ultimate analysis
                    merely a useful guide which should not be adhered to rigidly: <em>First Currency Choice</em> (above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) at [45]. In this
                    regard, the following passage from V K Rajah JA’s judgment in
                        <em>First Currency Choice</em> is of guidance to this
                    court (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Be that as it may, simplicity is certainly to be appreciated, and, in
                        assessing the obviousness of an alleged invention, it may sometimes suffice
                        in straightforward cases to refer to the test formulated by Lord Herschell
                        in <em>Vickers, Sons And Co, Limited v Siddell</em>
                        (1890) 7 RPC 292, where he stated (at 304) that an invention
                        lacked an inventive step if what was claimed was 'so obvious that it would
                        at once occur to anyone acquainted with the subject, and desirous of
                        accomplishing the end'. Quite often, it is difficult, in practice, to break
                        down the <em>Windsurfing</em> test ... into its
                        component parts. Thus, while the <em>Windsurfing</em>
                        test remains a useful guide, it is no more than that. Above all, it should
                        be borne in mind that the <em>Windsurfing</em> test is
                        merely a manifestation of judicial inventiveness on how best to
                        pragmatically interpret and elucidate the requirements of s 15 of the
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the English Court of Appeal’s
                    decision of <em>Mölnlycke AB v Procter &amp; Gamble</em>
                    [1994] RPC 49 (cited with approval in <em>Ng Kok
                        Cheng</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) at
                        [16] and <em>Mühlbauer AG</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>) at [19]), the
                    Vice-Chancellor, Sir Donald Nicholls stated that (at 113):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The Act requires the court to make a finding of fact as
                            to what was, at the priority date, included in the state of the art and
                            then to find again as a fact, whether, having regard to that state of
                            the art, the alleged inventive step would be obvious to a person skilled
                            in the art</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In applying the statutory criterion and making these findings the court
                        will almost invariably require the assistance of expert evidence. <em>The primary evidence will be that of properly qualified expert
                            witnesses who will say whether or not in their opinions the relevant
                            step would have been obvious to a skilled man having regard to the state
                            of the art. All other evidence is secondary to that primary
                            evidence</em>. In the past, evidential criteria may have been
                        useful to help elucidate the approach of the common law to the question of
                        inventiveness. Now that there is a statutory definition, evidential criteria
                        do not form part of the formulation of the question to be decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, in making findings of fact in relation to whether or not an
                    invention would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art having regard
                    to the state of the art as at the priority date of the patent, much would turn
                    on the opinions expressed by the expert witnesses called by both parties. Much
                    would also turn on whether, given the qualifications of the experts, they may
                    properly be said to be persons skilled in the art, and how the views expressed
                    by experts hold up under cross-examination. Also, at this stage of the inquiry
                    into patentability, it is permissible to mosaic together different pieces of
                    prior art for comparison with the invention to determine whether the invention
                    is obvious in the light of the state of the art as at the priority date of the
                    patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the defendant’s invention lacked an inventive
                step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff argues that since multicoloured
                    LED lights were widely available at the relevant time, it was obvious that a
                    multicoloured LED display panel could be used for displaying messages. Even if I
                    am wrong, when determining whether the invention is new, in construing the
                    references to an electronic display in the VICOS LIO and RTI documents to
                    include a multi-coloured LED light panel, because it amounts to mosaicking
                    different prior art publications, the court is well entitled to do so when
                    determining the question of obviousness. Since the VICOS LIO document, the VDV
                    300 document and the RTI document teach the display of messages from a remote
                    control centre via a communication means on the exterior of a transportation
                    means (like buses) using electronic displays, and multicoloured LED panels
                    coupled to display and logic controllers were widely available in the market
                    prior to the priority date of the defendant’s patent (4 October
                    2000), in my view it would have been obvious to a notional normally skilled but
                    unimaginative person that multicoloured LED displays may be used as an
                    electronic display for displaying messages from a remote control centre on a
                    transportation means like a taxi. The utilisation of a multicoloured LED display
                    panel is no more than a workshop variation to the existing state of the art as
                    evidenced by the VICOS LIO document, the VDV 300 document and the RTI
                    document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Furthermore, the plaintiff has also led
                    evidence that a system comprising multicoloured LED display panels mounted on
                    the dashboards of taxis in Japan had already been the subject of a patent
                    JP7191616 which was filed on 27 December 1993 and published on 28 July
                    1995. The Japanese invention could display messages such as
                    “vacant” in red and “premium” in green and other
                    messages in sour orange. The messages displayed change according to the hiring
                    status of the taxi. I am also of the view that it would have been obvious to a
                    person skilled in the art to mosaic the JP7191616 patent (which utilises
                    multi-coloured LED display panels mounted on the dashboards of taxis) with the
                    TIBS flip-dot-cum-LED display system (which utilises a monochrome
                    flip-dot-cum-LED display mounted on the taxi rooftop), and arrive at a taxi
                    rooftop display system which would be identical to the defendant’s
                    invention as claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I also have difficulty ascertaining, from the
                    defendant’s submissions, what exactly constituted the inventive step over
                    what was already known to persons skilled in the art as at the priority date of
                    the defendant’s patent. In the defendant’s answers to
                    interrogatories filed on 10 August 2010, the defendant stated that the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I am of the view that the defendant’s
                    answers are unhelpful in stating what exactly was the inventive step taken by
                    the defendant. However, upon a scrutiny of the defendant’s submissions, I
                    understand the defendant to be submitting that the defendant’s invention
                    consists of the following inventive steps:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the “multicoloured” display is a
                            multicoloured LED display panel;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the multicoloured LED display panel is mounted on
                            the rooftop of a taxi rather than some other transportation
                            means.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I am of the view that a person skilled in the
                    art reading the document at the relevant time would have, without requiring much
                    experimentation, imagination or undue effort, known that the teaching of the
                    component of an electronic display in the VICOS LIO document could take the form
                    of a monochrome or multicoloured panel of LED lights, given that both types of
                    LED lights had already become publicly available by the priority date of the
                    defendant’s patent, which was 4 October 2000. I am also of the view that
                    the mounting of the multicoloured LED display panel on the rooftop of a taxi
                    would be obvious to any person, let alone a person skilled in the art. As at the
                    priority date of the defendant’s patent, it was already very common, if
                    not the norm, for taxis in Singapore to have rooftop displays of their hiring
                    status albeit in the nature of flip-dot displays or monochrome LED cum flip-dot
                    displays. In any event, as I have noted above, the scope of the
                    defendant’s patent was drafted very widely to cover any manner of
                    transportation means, and that would have included buses and taxis. Thus, I am
                    of the view that the defendant’s patent lacks an inventive
                step.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I also note that the defendant had previously
                    submitted for registration a patent wherein Claim 1 of the patent claimed the
                    invention of a multicoloured rooftop display system without a link to a remote
                    control centre, but it had been rejected because the defendant’s invention
                    was neither novel nor inventive in comparison with a certain Patent WO 00/26062
                    owned by Adapt Media Inc (“Adapt Media Patent”). The invention
                    claimed in WO 00/26062 was for an electronic display secured on the rooftop of
                    taxis or other vehicles which display advertising messages. The messages
                    displayed are transmitted by many base stations around the country which
                    transmit the advertising messages to a controller on board the taxis. These base
                    stations only manipulate the messages displayed but do not control the movement
                    of the transportation means. The Austrian Patent Office, which was tasked with
                    the examination of the patentability of the defendant’s patent, stated in
                    its written opinion in relation to Claim 1 of the defendant’s original
                    patent claim that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Adapt Media Patent] discloses a mobile system for conveying visual
                        images to the public, the system including at least one vehicle, eg, a taxi,
                        a bus, or a tractor-trailer, external display panels comprising LEDs being
                        mounted to the vehicle, the display panels being capable of delivering
                        changeable messages, a programmable on-board controller being operably
                        connected to the display for driving the display panels to provide a
                        viewable message, the message content on the vehicle mounted display being
                        changeable as a function of the physical location of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, novelty and inventive step are not given and industrial
                        applicability is given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the Austrian Patent Office also opined that insofar as Claim
                    8 of the original patent discloses that the invention in Claim 1 may comprise a
                    remote control centre connected to the multicoloured display by way of a
                    communication means is concerned, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">None of the cited documents discloses a system comprising communication
                        means for communicating information regarding the status of the
                        transportation means between the logic controller and a remote information
                        source, wherein the remote information source is a control center for
                        monitoring and controlling the movement of the transportation means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, the requirements of novelty, inventive step and industrial
                        applicability are complied with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the light of the Austrian Patent Office’s opinion, the
                    defendant subsequently incorporated the integer of a remote control centre into
                    its original Claim 1, and successfully obtained the registration of its patent.
                    It would seem therefore that the only inventive step which the defendant’s
                    patent had over the existing patents for similar subject-matter was that the
                    messages displayed could be sent from a remote control centre via a
                    communication means, and that the remote control centre was a means for
                    monitoring and controlling the movement of the transportations means. It is
                    imperative to note that in rendering its written opinion, the Austrian Patent
                    Office had only conducted a search on existing registered patents over similar
                    subject-matter, and did not conduct a search on other prior art publications on
                    the same subject-matter. The VICOS LIO document, the VDV 300 document and the
                    RTI document were prior art publications which had, before the priority date of
                    the defendant’s patent, already taught the use of a remote control centre
                    to manipulate the messages displayed on an electronic display mounted on top of
                    a bus as well as to control and monitor the movement of buses within a fleet.
                    Therefore, the defendant’s patent is not inventive, as a notional person
                    skilled in the art does not require much imagination to connect the remote
                    control centre using a communication means with the multicoloured LED display
                    panel on the rooftop of a taxi and the mobile display terminal in the taxi, as
                    opposed to a bus, for the purpose of displaying information in relation to the
                    taxi’s hiring status and for monitoring and controlling the movement of
                    the taxi. It would have been obvious to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff for
                infringement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Given that I have held that the
                    defendant’s patent should be revoked on the ground that it does not
                    contain sufficient disclosure of the invention which would allow a person
                    skilled in the art to arrive at the invention claimed, and in any event that it
                    was not a patentable invention because it was neither novel nor inventive, the
                    issue of whether the defendant’s patent has been infringed does not arise.
                    However, for the sake of completeness, I will deal with this issue briefly in
                    this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Section 66(1), which provides for the
                    circumstances under which a patent is infringed, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Meaning of infringement</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>66</b>. —(1) Subject to the provisions of
                        this Act, a person infringes a patent for an invention if, but only if,
                        while the patent is in force, he does any of the following things in
                        Singapore in relation to the invention without the consent of the proprietor
                        of the patent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) where the invention is a product, he makes, disposes of, offers to
                        dispose of, uses or imports the product or keeps it whether for disposal or
                        otherwise;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) where the invention is a process, he uses the process or he offers it
                        for use in Singapore when he knows, or it is obvious to a reasonable person
                        in the circumstances, that its use without the consent of the proprietor
                        would be an infringement of the patent;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) where the invention is a process, he disposes of, offers to dispose
                        of, uses or imports any product obtained directly by means of that process
                        or keeps any such product whether for disposal or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, it can be seen that s 66(1)(a) provides for the circumstances
                    under which a product patent has been infringed while ss 66(1)(b) and (c)
                    provide for the circumstances under which a process patent has been infringed.
                    The approach to be taken in assessing the question of infringement is as set out
                    in <em>First Currency Choice</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) (at [76]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To determine whether there has been infringement of a patent, the scope of
                        the monopoly claimed in the patent must first be determined... The claims in
                        a patent specification are important because they fulfil a separate and
                        distinct function from the patent specification... in that what is not
                        claimed is deemed to be disclaimed... If the alleged infringement falls
                        within the words of one of the claims, the patent would have been
                        infringed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The extent of the monopoly claimed in a patent is found in “a
                    claim of the specification” as interpreted by the description and any
                    drawings contained in that specification: see s 113(1) of the Act and <em>Ng Loy Wee Loon</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) at 409. I refer to Lord Upjohn's oft-cited summary in
                        <em>Rodi &amp; Wienenberger AG v Henry Showell Ltd</em>
                    [1969] RPC 367, where he sets out the approach taken by the courts in
                    comparing infringing articles with patent claims (at 391):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he essential integers having been ascertained, the
                        infringing article must be considered. To constitute infringement the
                        article must take each and every one of the essential integers of the claim.
                        Non-essential integers may be omitted or replaced by mechanical equivalents;
                        there will still be infringement. I believe that this states the whole
                        substance of the "pith and marrow" theory of infringement. Furthermore,
                        where the invention, as in this case, resides in a new combination of known
                        integers but also merely in a new arrangement and interaction of ordinary
                        working parts it is not sufficient to shew that the same result is reached;
                        the working parts must act on one another in the way claimed in the claim of
                        this patent. This is well illustrated by <em>Birmingham Sound
                            Reproducers Ltd. v. Collaro Ltd</em>. [1956] R.P.C. 232 where Lord
                        Evershed, M.R. delivering the judgment of the court said at page 245:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"Thus the essence of the invention resides wholly in the selection and
                            arrangement of the parts and the manner in which they interact when
                            arranged in accordance with the invention. It is therefore essential to
                            the invention that it should consist of the particular parts described
                            in the claim arranged and acting upon each other in the way described in
                            the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The question therefore appears to be whether the allegedly infringing
                            apparatus consists of substantially the same parts acting upon each
                            other in substantially the same way as the apparatus claimed as
                            constituting the invention. It is not enough to find that the parts
                            comprised in the respondents' apparatus individually or collectively
                            perform substantially similar functions to those performed individually
                            or collectively by the parts comprised in the apparatus claimed as the
                            appellants' invention, or that the respondents' apparatus produces the
                            same result as the appellants' apparatus. It must be shown that the
                            respondents' selection and arrangement of parts is substantially the
                            same as the appellants' selection and arrangements of parts, for it is
                            in such selection and arrangement that the appellants' invention
                            resides."</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff, in its reply and defence to
                    counterclaim, pleaded that the defendant’s products, which it had imported
                    for sale in Singapore to taxi fleet companies, did not have a communication
                    means for communicating information regarding the status of the taxi between the
                    logic controller and a control centre for monitoring and controlling the
                    movement of the taxi. The plaintiff submits that it would have infringed the
                    defendant’s patent only if its product incorporates each and every single
                    essential element of the invention. Since the plaintiff had only imported for
                    sale taxi rooftop display signs which were not connected to a remote control
                    centre though a communication means via its logic controller, and since the
                    communication means and the central control centre were essential integers to
                    the defendant’s alleged invention as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 13 of the
                    patent, the plaintiff submits that it has not infringed the defendant’s

                    “a LED display system”. He then goes on to state that “[i]n
                    conclusion the [plaintiff’s] product falls in the scope of the claims of
                    the Defendant’s Singapore Patent No 89534”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     However, nowhere in Claim 1 of the
                    defendant’s patent is it stated that LED display is an integer of the
                    defendant’s invention. To recap, Claim 1 is a claim to a monopoly over a
                    product containing the following five essential integers:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a multicoloured display mountable on a
                            transportation means for displaying visual information;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a display controller for controlling the
                            multicoloured display;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a logic controller for providing logic control in
                            relation to the display of multicoloured visual
                        information;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a communication means for communication
                            information between the logic controller and a remote information
                            source; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the remote information source is a control centre
                            for monitoring and controlling the movement of transportation
                            means.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In fact, it is only in Claim 3 of the patent specification that it is
                    mentioned that a preferred realisation of the invention as claimed in Claim 1 or
                    2 is that the first integer, the multicoloured display, is in the form of an
                    array of multicoloured LEDs, each LED being capable of displaying multicolours.
                    However, in the pleadings and particulars of infringement filed by the
                    defendant, no infringement of Claim 3 was pleaded. During cross-examination, the
                    defendant was cross-examined on this aspect of his opinion, and an extract of
                    the notes of evidence reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mr Yeo also agreed that the
                    plaintiff’s product only utilises the first three integers and does not
                    utilise the fourth and fifth integers of the defendant’s alleged
                    invention. The defendant, on whom the burden of proving infringement lay, led no
                    evidence on whether the plaintiff’s product may be connected to a control
                    centre via a communication means. To recap, the communication means and the
                    remote control centre are, respectively, the fourth and fifth integers of claim
                    1 of the defendant’s patent. The burden was on the defendant to prove that
                    the plaintiff ‘s product, which has been disposed and offered for
                    disposal, by way of sale, utilises each and every single integer of the
                    defendant’s invention. In this regard, it is essential to refer to the
                    following paragraphs of Mr Yeo’s testimony under
                        cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the purport of the above extract is that the plaintiff’s
                    product only utilises three out of five integers of the defendant’s
                    invention. Mr Yeo’s evidence, insofar as he states that the
                    plaintiff’s product does not contain the fourth and fifth integers of the
                    defendant’s invention, undermines the defendant’s counterclaim.
                    Mr Yeo’s evidence that after modifications to the plaintiff’s
                    product, it would be capable of connection to a central remote control centre
                    misses the point because the plaintiff’s product, while in theory may be
                    modified to become a product which would infringe the defendant’s patent,
                    has not in fact been so modified. In that regard, it cannot be said that an
                    infringement of Claim 1 had occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Since Claim 2 is a claim which is dependent on
                    Claim 1, <em>ie</em>, it merely adds to the five essential
                    integers in Claim 1 an additional integer of an input device in the
                    transportation means for receiving input from the driver, accordingly, the
                    defendant’s counterclaim for infringement of the invention claimed in
                    Claim 2 must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I now turn to Claims 13 and 14 of the
                    defendant’s patent. The invention described in Claim 13 is a process,
                        <em>ie</em>, it appears that what is claimed is a
                    method of assembling components (specifically, the components are the five
                    integers of Claim 1) to form a rooftop display “system” mountable
                    on a transportation means. The reasons given above (at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>) for my holding that Claim 1 of the
                    defendant’s patent had not been infringed similarly apply here.
                    Accordingly, the defendant’s pleaded counterclaim for infringement of the
                    invention claimed in Claim 14, which is a claim over a process which mirrors
                    exactly Claim 2, must also fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the light of the foregoing, I order that
                    Singapore Patent No 89534 be revoked, and that the defendant’s
                    counterclaim against the plaintiff for infringement of the same patent be
                    dismissed. Unless the parties wish to be heard on costs, I will also award the
                    plaintiff costs to be taxed or agreed.</p>
