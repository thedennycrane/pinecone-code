</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Against this factual backdrop, it now falls to me to make the final arrangements for the children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In considering my decision, I have kept in mind two key principles. Both of these are axiomatic but are nevertheless worth restating:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first is the welfare principle. In deciding arrangements for children, I must have regard to the welfare of the children as my first and paramount consideration, to be analysed on all the facts of the individual case: s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) and s 125(2) of the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second is the principle of joint and enduring parental responsibility. The status of being a parent carries with it a complex and interlocking web of rights, duties, responsibilities and expectations which parents bear in relation to each other, in relation to the child and in relation to society at large. Parents remain subject to their parental duties, responsibilities and expectations throughout the entirety of their children’s childhood. That is so despite any strain or breakdown which may take place over that period in the parents’ relationship with each other. One aspect of this principle is embodied – at least for children born in wedlock – in s 46(1) of the Women’s Charter. That section establishes that, from the date on which a marriage is solemnised, the husband and the wife are mutually bound to cooperate with each other in caring and providing for their children. Although s 46 frames this aspect as a responsibility which each spouse has to the other, they must equally have that responsibility as parents to their child and to society at large.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I begin by considering the issue of custody.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Custody </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The parties are agreed on the principles of law governing my decision as to who is to have custody of the children. But they are diametrically opposed as to how those principles should be applied to the facts of this case.  I approach this section of my judgment by summarising the principles which I must apply, summarising the parties’ positions and then setting out my reasons for giving the parties joint custody.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Principles governing custody</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In ancillary proceedings following the typical divorce, there are three possible orders which a court can make for the custody of a child of the marriage: (a) the court can make no order as to who is to have custody of the child: (b) the court can make an order giving both parents joint custody of the child; or (c) the court can make an order giving one parent sole custody of the child to the exclusion of the other. The leading case on the principles guiding the choice between these three alternatives is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span><span class="font-italic"> (minor: custody and access)</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 (“<span class="font-italic">CX</span>”). From that case, I distil the following eight points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, the broad concept of custody comprises two categories of decision-making relating to a child’s upbringing and welfare: (i) decision-making on day-to-day matters with short-term consequences; and (ii) decision-making on more significant matters with long-term consequences. An order for care and control allocates the former category of custodial decision-making. What is loosely referred to as an order for custody <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> allocates only the latter, residual category of custodial decision-making: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [31]. In the remainder of this judgment, unless the context otherwise indicates, I shall use the word “custody” by itself to refer to this residual category of decision-making.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, the law of parenthood gives both parents joint custody of every child of a marriage even after divorce and even without a court order to that effect. Making no custody order and making a joint custody order upon divorce therefore have the same effect: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Third, the law of custody applies the welfare principle by recognising and supporting the twin concepts of joint parental responsibility and of life-long parental responsibility. This is because it is generally in the best interests of any child for that child to have both parents involved in his life for the entirety of his childhood, even after they divorce, rather than for that child to feel abandoned or to be left with the impression that one parent or the other no longer cares about his welfare: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [25] – [27].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Fourth, for that reason, and subject always to the welfare principle, an order for one parent to have sole custody is exceptional. In the usual case, a child’s welfare is best promoted by making either no custody order or a joint custody order: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [24]. That is because both orders uphold the principle of joint and life-long parental responsibility and also signal to the child that both parents will continue to be involved in his life: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [27]. All else being equal, that signal is in the best interests of the child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Fifth, the court should intervene in the parent-child relationship only when necessary. Thus, the principles set out above warrant the court declining to intervene in the parent-child relationship by making no custody order, for example, where there is little risk of future dispute between the parents over the child’s upbringing, where there is little risk that one parent will attempt to exclude the other from future decision-making about the child’s upbringing, where there is a real risk that court-ordered custody will result in both parents drawing the child into their disputes over their custodial powers and where the court does not wish judicially to anoint one parent as the custodial winner and the other parent as the custodial loser: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [19]. These same principles warrant the court intervening in the parent-child relationship by making a joint custody order where, for example, the circumstances make it necessary to give both parents an express reminder “that the law expects both of them to co-operate to promote the child’s best interest”: <span class="font-italic">CX</span> at [28].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Sixth, the fear that the parties may not be able to cooperate after the divorce in making custody decisions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> decisions on the more significant matters related to the child’s upbringing with long-term consequences for the child, is not in itself a reason to make a sole custody order. Custody decisions, unlike care and control decisions, are fewer in number and are farther between in time. A court order requiring the parents to make custody decisions jointly after the divorce therefore does not increase the risk of future acrimony in the same way that an order requiring them to make care and control decisions jointly would: <span class="font-italic">CX </span>at [35]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Seventh, it is wrong in principle to infer that parents who otherwise share a genuine concern for their child’s welfare will be unable to cooperate to promote his welfare after a divorce simply because they have been unable to cooperate to that end during the divorce. Allowance must be made for the fact that marital breakdown is, by its nature, highly stressful and that once the source of the stress ceases operate, the acrimony between the parties may subside over time. Acrimony between the parents should therefore not too easily be taken as evidence that the welfare principle warrants an exceptional sole custody order. As the Court of Appeal said (at [36] – [37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 In this day and age, we feel that the preferable position in the law of custody is that advocated by the father, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to preserve the concept of joint parental responsibility, even if the parties may harbour some acrimony towards each other. Often, [parties] rely on the acrimonious relationship of the parties to argue that joint custody will be detrimental to the welfare of the child. <span class="font-italic">However, they fail to appreciate the fact that some degree of acrimony is to be expected when parties are undergoing the stresses of a marital breakdown. As allegations of wrongdoings and breaches of fidelity can be hurtful, the time when the marriage breaks down may not be the best time to assess whether both parents can co-operate for the rest of the child’s life. We believe that the fear that parties cannot co-operate may be overstated.</span> It is a quantum leap in logic to assume that the parties’ inability to co-operate during the period of divorce or custody proceedings equates to an inability to agree on the future long-term interests of the child. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 To begin with, most custody cases arise over each parent’s concern for his or her child’s welfare. We agree with the judge’s observation that the parties’ relationship may be currently strained but there is room for hope that they will act in the best interests of the child in future. With the passage of time, emotions would have quietened down, the parties would have moved on with their respective lives and they should be able to make joint decisions objectively in the child’s best interests. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Finally, as to when a sole custody order is warranted, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CX</span> said this (at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… We agree with Assoc Prof Debbie Ong that the exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders are made may be where one parent physically, sexually or emotionally abuses the child ... or where the relationship of the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of cooperation is harmful to the child. ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 To the seventh point I have distilled from <span class="font-italic">CX</span> (see [38] above), I would add only that there is another reason to be wary of attaching too much significance to ongoing acrimony between divorcing parents in deciding whether to award sole custody to one of them. Doing so would have the unintended consequence of giving the divorcing parents a perverse incentive to gain a tactical advantage by ratcheting up the acrimony in the run up to a custody decision. Any marriage, even a short one, endows each spouse with an intimate knowledge of the other spouse’s trigger points. When the parties’ relationship breaks down, it is all too easy for one spouse to use that knowledge to engage in ostensibly innocuous behaviour which is in fact carefully calculated to provoke the other spouse and then to present the retaliatory response to the provocation to the court as evidence of acrimony warranting excluding the retaliating spouse from custody. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I now summarise the parents’ submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The wife’s submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The wife submits that the welfare principle dictates that she should have custody of the children because she knows the children’s needs and desires far better than the husband and has consistently used that knowledge over the years to make decisions in the children’s best interests free of extraneous considerations. In contrast, the husband should be deprived of custody because he has consistently acted to promote only his own interests, even when that is contrary to the children’s welfare. He inevitably and intransigently opposes anything which she proposes merely for the sake either of vindicating what he perceives to be his parental rights or even simply to oppose her. This has created deadlock in joint decision-making about the children which has been positively detrimental to their welfare.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The parties could not agree which kindergarten the daughter should attend. The wife wanted the daughter to attend Kindergarten A. The husband acquiesced in this and allowed the wife to put the daughter’s name on the lengthy waiting list for Kindergarten A when the daughter was just one year old. That was in 2005, before the parties’ relationship broke down. When the daughter turned three, in December 2007, nothing had been heard from Kindergarten A. The wife therefore enrolled her in Kindergarten B. In January 2009, Kindergarten A was finally able to offer the daughter a place. The wife proposed to accept the place. The husband insisted that the daughter remain in Kindergarten B even though he had never before objected to enrolling her in Kindergarten A and even though Kindergarten A was the more reputable kindergarten offering the daughter clear educational advantages. The wife had to apply for a court order to compel the husband to take the daughter to Kindergarten A during his weekday access under the order for interim care and control. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The parties could not agree which primary school the daughter should attend. The wife wanted the daughter to enrol at School C, which the wife had herself attended and at which the daughter would have priority in enrolment. The husband insisted instead that the daughter should enrol at School D at which she would have no priority. It took a hearing before Pillai J to break the deadlock. Pending the hearing, the husband even had his solicitors write to School C to warn them off enrolling the daughter until the parties had resolved their dispute. If School C had heeded the husband’s warning, the daughter ran the risk of not being enrolled in any school. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The parties could not agree which pre-school the son should attend. In November 2009, the husband proposed moving the son from Pre-School E, which he had been attending since March 2007, to Pre-School F, which was inappropriate for the son’s special needs. The only apparent reason was because the husband’s maid was habitually late in taking the son to Pre-School E.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The parties could not agree which school the son should attend after completing pre-school. This resulted in the son attending no school at all at all for almost 18 months. This situation persisted even though the son’s therapist had opined that being kept out of school was clearly contrary to the son’s best interests. The wife wanted the son to attend School F, a privately-run special school which charged fees of $1,800 per month and which carried certain advantages for the son. The husband insisted that the son attend School G, a special school run by a voluntary welfare organisation which charged fees of $14 per month and which carried certain disadvantages for the son. The husband’s preference for School G appeared to be solely because School F had failed to supply the husband information rather than the result of a belief that School G would advance the son’s best interests. The wife eventually had to file an application for the court to decide whether the son should attend School F.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) There was a significant delay before that application was ready to be heard on the merits. While waiting for the hearing, a place became available at School F. The wife accepted the place and enrolled the son there. The husband’s response was to file an urgent application asking the court to restrain the wife by injunction from taking the son to School F. He objected on the grounds that he had not been consulted on the decision. He objected even though the result of the injunction, if he had succeeded in securing it, would have been to keep the son out of school for more than two years, contrary to the son’s best interests. The husband’s application was dismissed.

Mrs H had been tutoring the daughter at Tuition Centre J. When Mrs H left Tuition Centre J, the wife wanted to maintain continuity by having Mrs H tutor the daughter privately at Mrs H’s home on Saturday mornings. But on the Saturdays when the husband took access with the daughter, he refused to take her for tuition with Mrs H. He attempted instead to arrange a different tutor for those days, even though it was not in the daughter’s best interests to be tutored in the same subject by two different tutors on alternating Saturdays.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) In 2008, when the son was only two, ear wax accumulated in his ear canal. The husband wanted to have the wax removed under general anaesthetic. The wife was horrified at this suggestion and took the son instead to an ear specialist. He noted that the accumulation of ear wax was not affecting the son’s hearing and therefore advised the mother to wait and see if the accumulation of ear wax would resolve itself over time. The ear specialist issued a written report opining that: “Given [the son’s] William’s Syndrome and multiple medical problems, the risk of undergoing … general anaesthesia is indeed real and high”.

He has, through his solicitors, demanded information about the children directly from the school rather than through the wife. He has even made complaints to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”) and National Council of Social Services about the son’s pre-school, accusing them about unfair treatment for failing to provide the husband with communications from the school to the parents. When the husband asserted this right against the son’s pre-school, it pleaded with his solicitors as follows: “… despite earlier communications, we continue to be inundated with legal letters requesting information that has already been communicated.  … This takes our focus and resources from our primary role of educating the child. We urge you and your client to allow the school to focus on its primary role and not be drawn into answering legal letters”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) He genuinely loves and cares for the children and has their best interests at heart. That is why, despite the various obstacles created by the wife and her best efforts to exclude him from the children’s lives, he has fought when necessary for his right to see and care for the children and has remained actively involved in their lives, their education and matters relating to their health.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Since 2007, he has been a stay-at-home parent. Therefore, unlike the wife who continues to work long hours as a private banker, he does not have to depend on maids to care for the children. In addition, he has extensive family support in his home from Ms X and from his own parents who live with him. As a result, the children are very happy and comfortable in his home.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) He has been the children’s primary caregiver since 2008. As a result of the interim access order made that year, the children have spent most of their waking hours over the past eight years with him rather than with the wife, save for the period in 2010 when the wife had his access suspended without basis. He is also the parent who ferries the children to school, classes and therapy during the week as and when required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Further, he submits that the welfare principle dictates that the wife should be deprived of custody because of her consistently unilateral approach towards parenting. This approach has four aspects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 First, the wife refuses to share information about the children with the husband. For example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In 2010 and 2011, the wife instructed the son’s general practitioner and therapist not to release information about the son to the father without the wife’s consent.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, the wife refuses to include the husband in decision-making on important matters relating to the children. For example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In 2008, the wife unilaterally withdrew the daughter from Kindergarten B and enrolled her in Kindergarten A. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In 2010, the wife unilaterally enrolled the daughter in School C even though husband and wife had agreed to enrol the daughter in School D, which is closer to both their homes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In 2012, the wife made a unilateral decision that the daughter should seek psychiatric help from a Dr Geraldine Goh without consulting the husband and without even informing him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In 2014, knowing that the husband opposed enrolling the son in School F, and even though her own application for the court to rule on the issue had not yet been determined, the wife unilaterally enrolled the son in School F, without consulting or informing the husband. She simply presented it to him as a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span> on the evening before the son’s first day of school. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Third, the wife restricts, reduces and denies the husband access to the children. For example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In February 2010, the wife secured court-ordered restrictions on the husband’s access to the children through false allegations of abuse. Further, when the husband’s access was later reinstated, the wife sought a condition that the access be supervised even though there was no basis whatsoever for imposing that condition. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The wife has made false, or at the very least exaggerated, allegations that the children are fearful of the husband in an effort to reduce his access. The husband has observed no fear whatsoever on the children’s part when they are with him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Fourth, the wife is alienating the children from the husband. She has been engaging in emotional and psychological abuse of the daughter in an attempt to engender in the daughter a fear of the father which does not otherwise exist. He claims also that the wife uses the daughter to obtain information about him.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Husband’s affidavit filed on 20 June 2013 at para 12 to 32.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 This brief summary of both parties’ submissions gives some flavour of the acrimony that has attended every step of these ancillary proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Order for joint custody</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Having considered the parties’ submissions, and for the reasons which follow, I find that this is not an exceptional case which warrants a sole custody order to promote the children’s welfare within the analytical framework established by <span class="font-italic">CX</span>. In short, I accept each parent’s submissions for why he or she should have custody while rejecting the other parent’s submissions as to why the first parent should be deprived of custody. Four points are significant to me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, because custody is fundamentally about decision-making, each parent’s capacity to make decisions to promote a child’s welfare is a fundamental aspect of a custody decision. In this case, neither the father’s nor the mother’s decision-making ability is compromised such that he or she cannot be trusted to participate in decisions relating to the children’s welfare (<span class="font-italic">cf.</span> <span class="font-italic">AVM v AWH </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1274 at [133]). Indeed, each parent has thus far demonstrated a well-developed decision-making capacity which they have applied successfully in their personal and professional lives and, before the breakdown of the marriage, for the children’s welfare. I am therefore satisfied, as a threshold matter, that each parent has the fundamental capacity to make sound decisions to promote each child’s welfare.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Second, I am satisfied that each parent genuinely loves each child. Neither parent alleges otherwise about the other parent. It is true that the wife suggests that the husband favours his children with Ms X over the children of the marriage. I do not accept that submission. His children with Ms X are younger and inevitably place more demands on his time when all five children are together. But that is no indication of a lack of true paternal love for the daughter and son.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Third, it is significant to me that the incidents which each parent focused on to argue that the other parent should be deprived of custody arose after their marriage had broken down and after these divorce proceedings had commenced. That suggests to me very strongly that it is the inevitable stress attendant upon any divorce which has caused the parties’ deadlock in making decisions for the children’s welfare and not any fundamental disability or disinclination to do so. I therefore cannot, within the analytical framework established by <span class="font-italic">CX</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [42]), rule out the possibility that the parties will eventually be able to cooperate as responsible parents once the red mist of divorce has lifted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Fourth, while it is true that the acrimonious relationship between the parties and their resulting failure to cooperate in making decisions for the children has caused difficulties for the children, I find that it has not now caused harm to the children, and that it is therefore no basis to infer that it is likely to cause harm to the children in the future. For example, it was obviously suboptimal that the son was kept out of school for 18 months while the parents’ litigation over the choice of school was pending. But the evidence is that his welfare was safeguarded during this interruption in that he continued to attend private lessons and to receive private therapy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Finally, acceding to either parent’s submission to exclude the other parent from custody requires me to make a finding of fault. I would have to ascertain which parent was responsible for both parents’ failure to agree on the many contentious issues which have arisen in relation to the children’s upbringing since these proceedings began.  I find that an impossible task.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I start by considering the many disputed decisions in relation to the children’s welfare and upbringing on which the parties have found themselves in deadlock. I have set out at [42] above why the wife says that her position on these areas was reasonable and the husband’s position unreasonable. However, the husband has in response given reasons why his position was reasonable and the wife’s unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Thus, in relation to the dispute over the choice of the daughter’s kindergarten, the husband says that both parents agreed to enrol the daughter in Kindergarten B as a compromise, and that it was the wife who was unreasonable in wanting to move the daughter out of Kindergarten B after she had been settled there for a year.

</div>
</div> In relation to the dispute over the choice of the daughter’s primary school, the husband’s response is that in the spirit of compromise, he acceded to the wife’s wish that the daughter attend one of two schools shortlisted by the wife, even though his own preferred choice was not on the shortlist. School D was on the wife’s shortlist. School C was not.

</div> The wife was therefore reneging on the parties’ compromise by insisting on enrolling the daughter in School C. As far as the son’s school is concerned, the husband has given on affidavit several reasons why he considers the wife’s choice, School G, to be the school least suited out of the five schools in Singapore in the same category for a pupil with the son’s special needs.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There is a great deal of truth in the wife’s submissions that the father’s conduct in these instances shows an unfortunate focus on vindicating what he sees as his own parental rights or on restraining what he sees as the wife’s overreach of her parental rights rather than on advancing the children’s best interests. The reasons which I have set out above at [58] for the positions taken by the husband have more than a trace <span class="font-italic">of ex post facto</span> rationalisation about them. I also find that the husband’s approach to third parties such as the children’s schools has been unreasonable, belligerent and ultimately inexcusable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the other hand, I accept that there is some truth in the husband’s assertion that the wife has acted in certain instances unilaterally, without consulting or informing the husband. However, I am satisfied that these are isolated instances arising from the wife’s genuine desire to advance the children’s best interests against the backdrop of an acrimonious divorce and are not, as the husband alleges, part of a larger pattern of unilateral parenting or of attempting to alienate the children from him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 If no custody order and a joint custody order were not options available to me, and I could make only an order for sole custody, either to the husband or to the wife, I would have unhesitatingly granted sole custody of the children to the wife. But a sole custody order is not my only option. And on the authority of <span class="font-italic">CX</span> I find it impossible to say with the requisite certainty that the husband’s behaviour has been so contrary to the welfare of the children that it is necessary to exclude him from custody in order to advance their welfare going forward.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In summary, I am satisfied that each parent has not only the capacity but also the inclination to make decisions which promote the welfare of each child. I am not satisfied that the deadlock which has arisen thus far has caused harm to the children. I cannot find that the deadlock is likely to continue once the parties have been removed from the crucible of divorce. And I find it impossible to be certain to the requisite degree that either parent is so predominantly at fault for the deadlock as to justify depriving that parent of custody. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The deadlock that has arisen in this case is nothing more than a temporary battle of wills. In a successful marriage, a battle of wills is avoided by trust. The spouses trust each other enough to divide up the labour of decision-making between them and to defer to each other on decisions taken within the other’s sphere of responsibility. When a marriage breaks down, trust evaporates, the spouses reclaim the delegated decision-making power and deadlock is the result. What has happened in this case, while far from ideal, is also far from unusual. It does not indicate that an exceptional sole custody order in favour of either parent is necessary to advance the children’s best interests. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Significance of the order for joint custody</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Having concluded that it is in the best interests of the children for both parents to have custody, I am left with a choice between making no custody order and making a joint custody order. I consider that the acrimony between the parties which I have summarised above – while not warranting a sole custody order in favour of either parent – is an indication that their relationship is likely to remain sufficiently fraught for sufficiently long into the future that it is not safe to leave this case with no custody order whatsoever. I therefore consider it appropriate that I should make a joint custody order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I take this opportunity to remind both husband and wife, through their respective counsel, of what should be obvious: they have a responsibility to cooperate to promote their children’s best interests. I remind the wife that it is in the children’s best interests for the husband to participate in long-term and significant decisions concerning the children’s welfare and upbringing. To that end, she should be open and cooperative with the father (see <span class="font-italic">CX</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]) and should not make long-term decisions for the children unilaterally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the light of this reminder directed to the wife, I do not find it necessary to order the wife, as the husband seeks, to provide him information relating to the education of the children and to give him a right by court order to obtain information about the children directly from the source rather than through the wife. I do not believe that it is in the interests of both parties or of the children for me to regulate by court order yet another aspect of the parties’ parenting. That would simply provide more fodder for repeated trips back to the court with complaints of breaches or of overreaching.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I now turn to the husband. I remind him that, if in future he finds himself opposed to the wife on a particular long-term decision for either child, he must bear in mind three points. First, for reasons I will come to (see [73] below), I have granted the wife care and control of the children. That will inevitably endow the wife with substantially greater insight than the husband can ever have about each child’s ever-evolving needs and wants, hopes and fears. That insight will place the wife in a far better position than him to know what will best promote the children’s welfare at any point in time, both in the short-term and for the long-term. Second, the wife undoubtedly loves the children at least as much as he does. He should learn once again to trust her not to conceive, let alone to advocate or to implement, a decision affecting either child which would be contrary to that child’s best interests. Third, his status as a parent carries with it not only the rights to be exercised on which he has been so focused but also duties to be discharged, responsibilities to be met and expectations to live up to. He must accept that discharging his duties as a parent, meeting his responsibilities as a parent and living up to society’s and his children’s expectations of him as a parent will sometimes require him to have the wisdom <span class="font-italic">not</span> to insist on exercising a parental right vested in him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 My joint custody order is intended as a signal to both parents that they have a joint and enduring parental responsibility to advance their children’s best interests. My joint custody order is also intended as a signal to both children that both parents love them and will remain involved in making long-term decisions for their lives. My joint custody order is not, however, intended as a signal to external parties. It should not be used by either parent to enjoin external parties to recognise that parent’s “rights” over the children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Both husband and wife must remember that custody is not an end in itself. Equally, a grant of custody is not a weapon to be used against the other parent, much less against third parties. Custody is simply a means to an end: that of promoting the welfare of the children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 If in the future, the husband and wife have different views on a particular custody decision affecting the children, I expect them to discuss and resolve their differences rationally, as intelligent and mature adults, focusing only on the children’s interests and leaving aside their own interests and their current or historical grievances with the other. All too often in these proceedings, the parties have resorted to the court to break their deadlocks. This must not continue. It is inconceivable to me that two parents could ever be content to let a stranger make an important long-term decision for their child rather than to work out a solution for themselves. That stranger, no matter how skilled in the law or conscientious in its application, cannot decide for a child as parents can. In any event, it is not the court’s function to be, in effect, the children’s third parent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Care and control</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I now deal with the issue of care and control. As pointed out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CX </span>at [31] – [32], the person granted care and control thereby becomes the children’s daily caregiver and is responsible for making short-term decisions for their day-to-day welfare. Like the grant of custody, the grant of care and control rests also on the welfare principle. In <span class="font-italic">ABW v ABV</span> [2014] 2 SLR 769, Judith Prakash J explained that the concept of “welfare” is not subjective, varying from judge to judge, but one which is underlined by principle and which requires the court to take into account all relevant factors. As Prakash J said at [23] – [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 The decision as to what is in the best interests of any particular child depends on the circumstances of the individual case and the individual child. However, this does not mean that that decision is a subjective one for the judge hearing the case. Rather, a number of relevant circumstances should be taken into account when arriving at a decision. The stability factor is but one such circumstance. Others include:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) which parent shows the greater concern for the child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the maternal bond;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the child’s wishes; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) the desirability of keeping siblings together.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 The degree to which any one factor or the other is to be given pre-eminence is not fixed but depends entirely on the facts of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At the outset, I should say that I have not for a moment considered separating the two siblings.

I say that for two reasons. First, I accept that the wife has been both children’s primary caregiver since birth and is in the best position to be their daily caregiver going forward.

The most damning evidence against the husband is his own handwritten note written in 2007 which reads, “<span class="font-italic">if I get high $ job or should I do divorce b4 high paying job…best get divorce b4 get job</span>”. I have no doubt that the husband has, since 2007, acted on his astute and cynical analysis that he would be better off in a divorce by deferring his re-employment until these proceedings are over.

As with all maincare givers [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], these infrequent meltdowns are not a reflection of their care but are part and parcel of caring for a child with specialised needs, and these often give us an indication of how adept the care giver is in managing it.

As the father’s parenting style is permissive, his interactions with his father is [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] relaxed and happy. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 While Dr Goh’s report accepts that the relationship between the children and the husband is a healthy one, it finds the relationship between the children and the wife to be closer. I therefore consider this a weighty factor in considering who should have care and control.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Although Dr Goh’s report was prepared some years ago, there is nothing in the evidence before me to suggest that circumstances have changed materially since then. The husband attacks Dr Goh’s report as being biased.  He even lodged a complaint with the Singapore Medical Council against Dr Goh, accusing her of overcharging and bias in her report. The wife has deposed that that complaint was dismissed. The husband has not suggested that the wife is wrong. I give the husband’s unfounded allegations against Dr Goh no weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I should point out, however, that my finding that the wife has been the active parent in aspects relating to the development of the children does not equate to a finding that, as she submits, she is the parent who is in fact more concerned with the development of the children. I accept that the husband is equally concerned as the wife for the children’s welfare. My finding is simply that the husband and wife display and act on their concern for the children in different ways; and that the wife’s way of doing so is more consistent with her exercising care and control over the children.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband has alienated children’s schools and therapists</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I also accept the wife’s submission that she is on better terms with the children’s schools and therapists than the husband. It is crucial that the parent who has care and control has a good and healthy rapport with the children’s schools and therapists who provide the necessary support for the children’s development. Given the son’s special needs, this is especially important in relation to the son’s schools and therapists. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The husband’s unnecessarily belligerent approach has alienated both children’s schools. His accusation that the daughter’s primary school was aiding the mother “in the psychological abuse of [the daughter]” sparked a robust response from the school (see [42(i)] above). The son’s school complained of being inundated by letters from the husband’s solicitors requesting information. He has also made a complaint of unfair treatment to MSF about the son’s school. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 There is nothing wrong in itself with the husband making repeated complaints, and even with him expressing his complaints in intemperate language. But that is so only if there is a legitimate basis to justify each complaint and to justify the intemperate language used. The evidence does not bear out any justification for the husband’s conduct. I find that his complaints were made not to promote the children’s welfare but either to insist on his conception of his parental “rights” or simply out of pique. While I have not held the quality of this behaviour against the husband in my decision on custody, I do consider that it weighs heavily against him in my decision on care and control.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Preserve stability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I am also conscious that it is ordinarily in the children’s best interests to preserve stability. The mother has had interim care and control of the children since 2011. The daughter was six and the son was five when the interim arrangement was put in place. They are now eleven and ten respectively. Care and control with the wife has been the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> for the best part of their lives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Although the effect of my award of care and control to the mother is to preserve the <span class="font-italic">status </span><span class="font-italic">quo</span>, that has not been a significant factor in my decision. The interim arrangements gave the father very liberal access to the children: on weekdays, on weekends and overnight. Both parents have therefore played a significant part in the lives of the children since the wife left the matrimonial home. In these circumstances, I do not consider that maintaining stability for the children is a weighty factor in favour of granting the wife care and control. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Wife’s submissions on injuries to son not accepted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The wife submits two additional factors as to why she should have care and control. In arriving at my decision to award her care and control, I have rejected both. I should make clear why.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 First, the wife says that the son returned from access with the husband and his family on two occasions in 2009 and on one occasion in 2010 with bruises. Because the son does not bruise easily, the wife’s view is that the bruises could have been deliberately inflicted. On that basis, she had the husband’s access suspended and reported the matter through KKH to the child-protection authorities to investigate. She suggests, therefore, that the husband should not be granted care and control because there is a demonstrated risk of non-accidental physical harm to the son while he is with the husband. I reject that submission. There is absolutely no basis for the suggestion that the son’s injuries were non-accidental.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Second, the wife says that both children feel neglected or secondary to their three step-siblings in the husband’s new household. It is, of course, inevitable that the oldest two children in a household of five children will receive a little less attention than the younger three children. But I find that these two children do not receive any less time or any less attention in the husband’s current household simply by reason of their being the children of the husband’s first marriage.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on care and control</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 For all the foregoing reasons, I have decided that the wife should have care and control. The strong maternal bond between the wife and both children coupled with the mother’s active and direct role in the children’s upbringing and her better rapport with the children’s schools and therapists lead me to the conclusion that the mother is best placed to be their daily caregiver and to make the associated daily short-term decisions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Access</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I now turn to access. In <span class="font-italic">BG v BF</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 (“<span class="font-italic">BG</span>”), the Court of Appeal explained “[t]he purpose of access is to allow the spouse not having care and control of the children to maintain regular contact with them” (at [11]). <span class="font-italic">BG</span> confirms also that the decision on access, like all other decisions relating to children, is ultimately driven by the welfare principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I have granted the husband what I consider to be liberal access to the children. It is true that the effect of my order is significantly to reduce the husband’s access from that which he has enjoyed under the order for interim access which has been in place since 2011 (see [25] above). However, I have concluded that the welfare principle requires me to reduce the father’s access for two reasons which are no reflection on the husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 First, I accept the wife’s submission that under the existing arrangement, the husband’s access periods and the travelling time necessary to make that degree of access possible consume the most part of the children’s waking hours. The orders for interim access allow the husband access for several hours after school every weekday until either just before dinner time or just after dinner time. From Monday to Friday, therefore, the children are constantly on the go: from home to school to the father’s house back to home. I do not consider it to be in the children’s best interests for that arrangement to continue on a permanent basis. A nomadic lifestyle is disruptive for the children and cannot be in their best interests. They require stability in their daily lives, particularly as they get older. It is therefore important that the final orders for access allow them to spend sufficient time at home during the week to rest, to play and to do their school work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, four years have passed since the orders for interim access were made. The daughter now has significantly more educational and extracurricular commitments, both in school and outside school. These commitments will only increase in the run-up to the all-important Primary School Leaving Examination which she will take at the end of 2016. The son was not in full-time school when the interim orders were made, but is now in full-time school. The children’s increased school hours coupled with the additional time spent on extra-curricular activities greatly reduces the number of free waking hours they now have. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 For both these reasons, it follows that the husband’s access must be decreased in the best interests of the children. I have therefore ordered that the husband is to have access to the children on only one weekday evening, and even then allowing the children enough time to come home after school on that day and rest. In summary, the husband is to have access as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Every Wednesday from 5.00 pm to 7.30 pm, subject to (c), (d) and (e) below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Overnight access on alternative weekends from 5.00 pm on Friday to 2.30 pm on Sunday, subject to (c) and (e) below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In odd years, during the first half of the June and the November/December school holidays.

Both outcomes are undesirable in that both by definition result in a division of matrimonial assets which is neither just nor equitable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The Court of Appeal has set out the following structured four-step approach (at [22] to [29]; see also <span class="font-italic">Twiss</span><span class="font-italic">, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</span> [2015] SGCA 52 at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, derive a ratio which represents the relationship between the direct financial contributions of each party towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Next, derive a second ratio which represents the relationship between the non-financial and indirect financial contributions of each party towards the welfare of the family. This is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment to be approached in broad strokes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Then, average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. This average forms the basis for the division of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, make any adjustments which are necessary to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I must of course adopt and apply this approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Before I turn to the specific matrimonial assets to be divided, I deal with two preliminary points: (a) the appropriate method for arriving at the parties’ direct financial contributions to the matrimonial assets; and (b) whether an inference should be drawn adverse to either party that he or she has failed to give full and frank disclosure of his or her assets to the court.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Method to be adopted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Both parties submit that I should use the classification method instead of the global assessment method. In <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<span class="font-italic">NK</span>”), the Court of Appeal explained the difference between the two methods (at [30] – [33]). In the global assessment method, the court makes an overall assessment of the parties’ relative direct and indirect contributions to the marriage and then applies that assessment to the entire pool of matrimonial assets. By its very nature, the global assessment method takes into account the parties’ indirect contributions only once (at [21]). That assessment must then be reflected consistently across all classes of assets (<span class="font-italic">AYQ v AYR</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter</span> [2013] 1 SLR 476 at [23]). In the classification method, the court divides the matrimonial assets into classes and conducts a separate analysis of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions to each asset class. This method is “more appropriate where there are multiple asset classes, and where each party has made different contributions” to each asset class (at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As <span class="font-italic">NK</span> makes clear (at [33]), neither method is inherently superior to the other. Both methods are entirely consistent with the legislative framework provided by s 112 of the Women’s Charter. They are simply different arithmetical means by which to achieve the same statutory end: dividing the matrimonial assets in a just and equitable manner. Thus the Court of Appeal acknowledged in <span class="font-italic">NK</span> (at [35]) that either method would be likely to achieve the same result in the vast majority of cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 There is nothing in this case which leads me to conclude that, to use the words of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">NK</span> (at [35]), either one of the two methods would be “more principled and conducive to a fair and equitable division”. This case is, therefore, one of the vast majority of cases in which both methods would achieve a just and equitable division of the matrimonial property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I consider the global assessment method to be appropriate to the facts of this case. I accept what Woo Bih Li J said in <span class="font-italic">YG v YH</span> [2008] SGHC 166 (“<span class="font-italic">YG</span>”) (at [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, the global assessment methodology is preferable in the present case. It is in close keeping with the court’s broad brush approach as well as reluctance to engage in minute scrutiny of the conduct and contributions of both spouses. It allows for the fact that when parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition of assets, they usually do so in good faith without regard to the question of division or each party’s share in each asset acquired. For instance, a wife may pay less for the matrimonial home on the understanding that she will pay more for the family car, but it would usually be the case that both parties would not have considered whether she should then have a smaller share in the matrimonial home or a larger share in the family car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the present case, the parties are of roughly equal financial standing, both in terms of their net worth and in terms of their ability to generate income. A marriage is no less an economic union than any other type of union. Each spouse was capable of making equal direct contributions to each of the matrimonial assets. Further, there is no suggestion that either spouse has made unequal indirect contributions to any particular matrimonial asset.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The fact that there are different classes of assets, in itself, is to my mind not a sufficient reason to mandate the classification method. The fact that the pool of matrimonial assets is large is also not a factor against using the global assessment method. For example, this method was used in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Nancy Tay</span>”) where the total value of the matrimonial assets was $62.7m (at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In these circumstances, it appears to me that it is entirely appropriate to consider the pool of matrimonial assets globally.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adverse inferences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Each party invites me to infer that the other party is concealing matrimonial assets falling within specific asset classes and to redress the prejudice caused by the concealment by augmenting the first party’s share of the matrimonial assets in the affected class. This is, in fact, one of the reasons given by the parties for advocating the classification methodology. For reasons I will come to, I have declined to draw any adverse inference against either party. But for that aspect of my decision, I may well have been inclined to adopt the classification methodology so as to confine the consequences of the adverse inference to the relevant class of assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 A party who asserts that the other party has failed to disclose matrimonial assets bears the legal burden of proof on that assertion. In order to cast even a tactical burden on the other party in respect of that asset, the first party must at least be able to: (a) present a substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of concealment by the other party; and (b) show that the other party has particular access to the information he is alleged to be hiding, even if that is shown only in the sense that that information is peculiarly within his knowledge: <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</span> [2007] SGCA 21 at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay </span><span class="font-italic">Sim</span> [2015] 2 SLR 195 at [62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I turn to each party’s submissions on why an adverse inference should be drawn against the other party.

</div> and that he has remained without employment to date purely to gain a tactical advantage in these proceedings (see [76] above). The wife submits that the tactical advantage which the husband has gained in the division of the matrimonial assets is that he has been able since 2007 to earn an income without having to account for it. To support her submission that the husband must be earning an income, the wife points to the fact that he continues to incur and discharge substantial expenses every month, including credit card debt, while apparently having no source of funds from which to do so. For example, in April 2008, the husband’s personal and household expenses were $34,661.08.

</div> The husband explains these transactions as loans between mother and son. According to the wife, there is no reason for mother and son to be making repeated loans to each other in this fashion. The husband is a self-made man of means while his mother is not well-off by any means. In light of this, the wife submits that these transfers back and forth are not in truth loans: the husband is simply using his mother’s name and accounts to hide his funds. Furthermore, the wife points to instances in the past where the husband has used his mother’s name to avoid tax either by putting his own investments in her name to mitigate his liability to capital gains tax or by transferring his income to her to mitigate his liability to income tax. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The husband’s <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Finally, the wife submits that the husband nitpicks at the wife’s assets and means with the intention of harassing and oppressing her. He has raised baseless allegations that she has fabricated bank statements. He alleges that the wife is indebted to him as a result of a series of money transfers between husband and wife from 2003 to 2007. He lays claim to a number of assets held by the wife which cannot, on any reasonable view, be matrimonial assets. All this shows that the husband’s <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> in these proceedings is misdirection: he seeks to shift the court’s focus from his own concealment of assets by making multiple baseless allegations that the wife is concealing assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 As a result of the foregoing, the wife invites me to draw an adverse inference against the husband and to deprive him of the benefit of his concealment by giving her an uplift of 15% in dividing the known matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The husband submits that, in truth, it is the wife who is concealing matrimonial assets. The husband provides as examples the failure of the wife to disclose the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Her beneficial interest in a bank account held with Citibank and a share-trading account with an online share broker held in the name of her sister-in-law. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Her rental income from a property in Swiss View.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Her account with HSBC in Perth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The husband claims that the wife disclosed these assets only when he raised these matters in his second affidavit of assets and means. This, he says, demonstrates her evasiveness when it comes to disclosing assets for the purpose of division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In addition, the husband claims that the wife has failed, throughout these proceedings, to give a full and honest account of the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A property owned by her but registered in the name of her mother and her sister, for which she receives a monthly rental income of $7,000 to $8,000. The husband had to obtain a court order to compel the wife to disclose the particulars of this property. She has yet to comply with the court order, taking the position that she is not aware of the property’s address because it is not the wife’s but was instead purchased by her mother as a gift for her sister.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Her ownership of a company known as Skyline Coast Ltd. The husband points to various transfers of funds from the wife to that company. The husband also avers that the wife has not provided any documentary evidence to prove, as she asserts, that the company belongs to her mother. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Her bank statements, in particular the statements from DBS Vickers and Merrill Lynch. The husband claims that the wife has not produced monthly statements of account in respect of the cash balances or cash transactions with DBS Vickers and that her various explanations in relation to the failure to disclose them (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> that the documents are not vital or that there were no statements generated due to inactivity) are flawed and should not be believed. In respect of her account with Merrill Lynch, the husband claims that the wife is in breach of a court order requiring her to disclose particulars of the account including monthly statements. The husband avers that no original statements have been produced for inspection and the statements were redacted without informing the husband. He alleges that there is reason to believe that the statements have been doctored because of the differing fonts used in the statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 As a result of the wife’s failure to disclose matrimonial assets, the husband submits that an adverse inference should be drawn against her in dividing the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I decline to draw an adverse inference against either party in this case. To my mind, any adverse inference I can draw against one party would be met and neutralised by an adverse inference against the other party. Both the wife and husband have demonstrated a substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the other that there are some assets which have not been disclosed to the court. It also cannot be denied that each party has particular access to the information which the other alleges has been hidden. If I accept one party’s invitation to draw an adverse inference against the other, I would have to accept both parties’ invitations to do so. Drawing adverse inferences against both sides would not advance the final aim of arriving at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In any event, even if I were to draw an adverse inference against only the husband, I do not consider applying a flat 15% uplift on the affected asset class to be a satisfactory basis on which to quantify the value of that adverse inference. To the extent that the wife is unable to point to any specific asset with a specific value which the husband has concealed, applying a 15% uplift to the affected asset class is arbitrary and would be neither just nor equitable. To the extent that the wife is able to point to a specific asset with a specific value which the wife asserts the husband is falsely withdrawing from the pool of matrimonial assets, I will consider separately in my analysis below whether that asset is in truth a matrimonial asset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In the circumstances, therefore, I have decided not to draw an adverse inference against either party for the benefit of the other.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Exclusion of sale proceeds from the Ardmore property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Before assessing and dividing the pool of matrimonial assets, I address a specific matrimonial asset which both parties have agreed should be outside the pool. In 2011, the parties agreed to sell a jointly-owned property (which I shall refer to as “the Ardmore property”) and to divide the net proceeds of sale comprising $5.618m equally between them. It is common ground that the Ardmore property is a matrimonial asset. It is also common ground that the equal division of that asset is the just and equitable division of it, without going into a consideration of each party’s direct or indirect contributions, whether to the Ardmore property specifically or to the marriage generally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The parties’ agreement on that issue is not, of course, determinative: <span class="font-italic">NK</span> at [40]. But both parties before me are financially sophisticated and shrewd. Further, they reached their agreement against the background of these proceedings and with the benefit of legal advice. I therefore accept that an equal division of the Ardmore property is the just and equitable division. In those circumstances, I decline to exercise my power to divide this particular matrimonial asset (see <span class="font-italic">Oh </span><span class="font-italic">Choon v Lee Siew Lin</span> [2014] 1 SLR 629 (“<span class="font-italic">Oh </span><span class="font-italic">Choon</span>”) at [15]; <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat</span>”) [2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The parties are therefore at liberty to retain their agreed share of the net proceeds of sale of the Ardmore property. This asset will be left out of account in assessing the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I now assess the pool of matrimonial assets which falls to be divided. I will deal first with real property before turning to the other assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Real property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the course of submissions, the husband confirmed through counsel that he is not pursuing his claim that the following properties are matrimonial assets:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A property which the wife acquired before the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A property which the wife acquired using her share of the net proceeds of sale of the Ardmore property after interim judgment in these proceedings was made final; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A property acquired in 1993 and which is not, in any event, owned by the wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The husband also concedes that he does not have sufficient basis to argue that another property jointly owned by the wife’s mother and sister is a matrimonial asset. In my view, the husband’s concession in relation to these four properties is no concession at all. His claim that these properties were matrimonial properties should not have been advanced and would have failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The parties agree that the following properties are matrimonial assets:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the matrimonial home; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the property now occupied by the wife and children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The parties dispute whether the following properties are matrimonial assets:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) two properties in Hillcrest owned by the wife;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a property in Gallop owned jointly by the wife and her sister; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a property in Cairnhill owned jointly by the husband and his mother.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This Cairnhill property has been sold for a profit of $981,297 and the net proceeds of its sale are now held in an escrow account pending the outcome of these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I shall first determine which of the disputed assets are matrimonial assets before turning to the valuation of these assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The disputed properties</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The two Hillcrest properties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I find that the two Hillcrest properties are matrimonial assets. The wife signed the options to purchase the two Hillcrest properties in or around September 2007, shortly before her solicitors sent a letter to the husband seeking a divorce. She completed the purchase of the Hillcrest properties in September 2009, after interim judgment was granted but before it was made final.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The wife argues that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat </span>should be applied and that I should exercise my discretion to exclude the two Hillcrest properties from division even though they are “technically” matrimonial assets given that they were acquired before final judgment was granted (see <span class="font-italic">Nancy Tay </span>at [40] where the operative date used was the date on which the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> was granted). I make two points on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 First, the present case can be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat</span>, which had an unusual set of facts. The wife in <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat</span> wholly disassociated herself from the purchase of the property and insisted that the husband should bear the entire risk of the investment. In the present case, there is no evidence that the parties shared the understanding that only the wife was to be solely responsible for the risk in acquiring the two Hillcrest properties. Importantly, it has not been shown that the husband disassociated himself from the properties. Thus, I do not think that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat</span> applies to this case. Although I accept that I have the discretion to decline to exercise the power of division over a particular matrimonial asset (see [123] above), I will not do so in relation to the two Hillcrest properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Second, I note that <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huat</span> pre-dates cases such as the authoritative Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Nancy Tay</span> which held that “during the marriage” need not mean up until the time of final judgment (<span class="font-italic">Nancy Tay</span> at [32] – [36]). This in turn raises the question of what is the operative date which this court should adopt to determine whether the assets, and specifically the two Hillcrest properties, constitute a matrimonial asset. On this issue, the Court of Appeal recognised in <span class="font-italic">Nancy Tay</span> that there is no fixed operative date and the key consideration is that a just and equitable result be achieved (at [39]). It is also open to the court to apply different operative dates for different assets if the circumstances so warrant (<span class="font-italic">Nancy Tay</span> at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The parties in this case agree that the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets should be the date on which the interim judgment was granted (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 January 2009). I am independently of the same view. The question then is whether I should apply a different operative date for the two Hillcrest properties in order to exclude them from the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to apply a different operative date to the two Hillcrest properties simply because they were acquired shortly before the wife’s solicitors sent the letter foreshadowing divorce. This is especially so considering that it is not uncommon for properties to be regarded as matrimonial assets even when they are acquired after the commencement of divorce proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The Gallop property</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I find that the Gallop property is not a matrimonial asset. I accept the wife’s submission that this property was a gift from her mother to her and her sister. Importantly, the property was gifted in 1999, four years before the marriage. I accept also that the property is financed by the rental proceeds from the property itself or by the wife’s mother. I note that the wife’s mother is the guarantor of the loan for this property and that the bank statements for the joint account, though in the wife and her sister’s names, are sent to their mother’s residential address. Further, the Gallop Road property was never substantially improved by either party during the marriage. It therefore falls outside of the definition of a matrimonial asset.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The Cairnhill property</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I find that the Cairnhill property is a matrimonial asset. This property was acquired in November 2006 in the name of the husband and his mother. I accept the wife’s submission that the husband’s mother made no payment towards the acquisition of the property and therefore holds only the bare legal title to the property with no beneficial interest in it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">Conclusion on the properties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 To summarise, I have found that the following properties are matrimonial assets: the matrimonial home, the property now occupied by the wife and children, the two Hillcrest properties and the Cairnhill property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I move now to consider the value of these properties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Value of the properties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The parties are in broad agreement that jointly-owned assets should generally be valued as at the date of the ancillary hearing while solely-owned assets should be valued as at the date of interim judgment (<span class="font-italic">Anthony Patrick Nathan v Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Siew Chin</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1121 at [23] and [26]). As is typical in these matters, I do not have a valuation of each asset precisely on the operative date. I am therefore constrained to use the values available in the evidence before me which are as close to the operative date as possible. In this regard, I observe that the value of the matrimonial home has increased more than threefold, from $2.92m in late 2003 to $9.37m as at June 2014 (which is the most up to date valuation in the evidence).

</div> A substantial amount of the payments towards the acquisition of the real properties came from this joint account. Having heard the evidence of the parties, I am satisfied that the monies in the joint account were contributed mostly, if not solely, by the husband. The wife’s evidence shows that she treated the funds in this account as belonging to the husband and not as joint property. Thus, she treated her transfers of her own funds into this account as repayment of certain debts which she owed to the husband.

Therefore, I attribute the money from this joint account which was used to pay for the properties solely to the husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I find that the husband contributed almost 100% of the purchase price of the matrimonial home and precisely 100% of the purchase price of the Cairnhill property. The wife financed the Hillcrest properties entirely by herself. As for the property now occupied by the wife and children, the parties agree that they paid the down payment and the monthly mortgage instalments in equal shares. The wife, however, submits that she paid in addition the sum of $115,979.27 for renovations. On this issue, however, I accept the husband’s submission that most of the documents produced by the wife as evidence of this contribution cannot be said to be for renovation works. Most of the documents produced by the wife evidence payments made for furniture, curtains and electronic items. These are not, therefore, direct contributions to the acquisition or improvement of this matrimonial asset.

I start with the remaining solely-owned matrimonial assets. The evidence before me does not show how much each party actually contributed to each of these remaining assets at the time of acquisition. The evidence merely shows the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of these remaining assets as at the operative dates. Taking a broad brush approach, it appears to me that this value is a reasonable proxy for the parties’ actual direct contributions at the time of acquisition. None of the remaining matrimonial assets are likely to have increased in value from the time of acquisition in the same way as the matrimonial real property has, whether in relative or in absolute terms. I therefore credit the parties with the full value on the operative date of each of the remaining assets which they hold in their own name as a best available proxy for their direct historical contribution towards the acquisition of that asset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 That leaves only the remaining jointly-held matrimonial assets. The value of these assets is only $39,000. This is not a material sum in the larger scheme of things. I therefore attribute the value of this asset equally to each party as his and her direct contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The result is that the parties’ direct contributions to all of the matrimonial  assets, including the real assets, are as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Matrimonial Assets</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife’s direct contribution</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband’s direct contribution</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Jointly owned</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">$19,500</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">$19,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">In their own names</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">$763,575.51</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">$1.96m</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Properties (as calculated in the previous table)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Approximately $1.96m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Approximately $2.83m</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Total direct contribution to all the assets</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Approximately $2.743m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Approximately $4.809m</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Percentage of direct contribution</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">36.3%</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">63.7%</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I now turn to ascertain the indirect contribution of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ratio of indirect contribution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I find that the wife’s indirect contributions are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The children are cared for primarily by the wife. At the time of the marriage and at the time of the birth of the daughter, the husband was residing in Hong Kong. The husband moved back to Singapore before the birth of the son. But even though he lived in Singapore, the husband was rarely at home. The wife therefore became the primary caregiver for the children. She made the children her priority, taking care of all their needs. As mentioned above, the wife took the lead in understanding and addressing the son’s special needs. The husband on the other hand was rarely at home after he left his job. He spent much of his time overseas without displaying much interest in the children until the wife commenced divorce proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The wife also set up the matrimonial home. As the husband was living in Hong Kong at the time of the marriage, the wife was the one who personally oversaw all the major renovation works and additions to the matrimonial home over a period of nine months. She did this in addition to her work commitments as a private banker and even while she was pregnant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The wife played an instrumental role in the husband’s career advancement in Singapore. On top of supporting her husband with dedication, the wife used her family connections in Singapore to assist the husband in settling down in Singapore. She personally helped with his permanent residency application as well as the application for long term visitor passes for his parents. When the husband started his own hedge fund, the wife was instrumental in finding office space, hiring secretarial support and the opening bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The husband rejects the wife’s submissions as to the magnitude of her own indirect contributions. He submits that only a small percentage of the matrimonial assets should be attributed to the wife to account for her non-financial contributions because the marriage was a short one of about four years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As for his own indirect contributions, the husband points to the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At all times during the marriage, the wife was working full-time. In January 2007, the husband left his job to become a stay-at-home father. He became the primary caregiver of the children after he left his job.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The husband also paid most of the family’s expenses, even after he left his job. He paid the utilities bill, the foreign worker’s levy, the driver’s salary and even maintenance and repair bills. The wife paid for the maid for groceries.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The husband also claims to have been very much involved in the renovation of the matrimonial home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In my view, a just and equitable ratio of indirect contribution is 55% to the wife and 45% to the husband. I reach this ratio on a holistic view of the evidence before me which includes the wife’s role as the primary caregiver of the two children of the marriage and the fact that the husband frequently travelled for the first few years of the marriage. In favour of the husband though, I take into account the fact that the husband increased his indirect contributions by helping to take care of the children since his employment ceased in January 2007. Although I have found (see [76] above) that he has deliberately not sought re-employment in order to gain tactical advantage in these proceedings, that motivation does not detract from the fact that his indirect contributions since 2007 did increase, though perhaps not as much as he self-servingly asserts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I also take into account the son’s special needs. The fact that the son has special needs certainly does not mean that <span class="font-italic">only</span> the wife’s indirect contributions increased. I have no doubt that both his parents love and care for the son and have had to bear in their own way the additional responsibilities which arise from his special needs. But I am of the view that his special needs have demanded and received more by way of indirect contributions from the wife than from the husband. I have therefore augmented the wife’s indirect contributions by a small margin to reflect this. In my view, if my assessment of 55% indirect contributions to the wife and 45% to the husband is in error at all, it is in error because it is overly generous to the husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I now turn to the average weighted ratio that should be attributed to the financial and non-financial contribution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Average ratio of contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>, the Court of Appeal went on to explain (at [26]) that though in “many instances” the collective indirect contributions made by both parties carry as much weight as the collective direct financial contributions made by both parties, there may be instances where one component assumes greater importance and therefore deserves greater weight than the other. In those cases, it is open to the court further to calibrate the “average ratio” in favour of one party to reflect what would be a just and equitable result of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 This calibration, as the Court of Appeal stressed, is in all cases a non-mathematical balancing exercise and a fact-sensitive inquiry which can take into account a number of factors depending on the circumstances of the case (at [27]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The circumstances that could shift the “average ratio” in favour of one party are diverse, and in our judgment, there are at least three (non-exhaustive) broad categories of factors that should be considered in attributing the appropriate weight to the parties’ collective direct contributions as against their indirect contributions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     The length of the marriage. Indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages (<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hwee Lee</span> ([18] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [85]). Conversely, indirect contributions usually play a <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span> role in short, childless marriages…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     The size of the matrimonial assets and its constituents. If the pool of assets available for division is extraordinarily large and all of that was accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts, direct contributions are likely to command greater weight as against indirect contributions…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     The extent and nature of indirect contributions made. Not all indirect contributions carry equal weight. For instance, the engagement of a domestic helper naturally reduces the burden of homemaking and caregiving responsibilities undertaken by the parties, and to that extent, the weight accorded to the parties’ collective indirect contributions in the homemaking and caregiving aspects may have to be correspondingly reduced. The courts also tend to give weighty consideration to homemakers who have painstakingly raised children to adulthood, especially where such efforts have entailed significant career sacrifices on their part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Bearing these factors in mind, I am of the view that a recalibration of the average ratio is necessary in this case. I attribute a weight of 70% to direct contributions and a corresponding weight of 30% to indirect contributions. I arrive at this weightage because: (a) this was a relatively short marriage of four and a half years; (b) the pool of matrimonial assets is large; (c) the parties kept their finances largely separate throughout the marriage; and (d) the parties had the help of domestic staff (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, maids and a driver) which to that extent reduced the weight to be attached to the parties’ indirect contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The parties’ average percentage contribution as derived from their direct and indirect contribution in relation to the matrimonial assets is therefore as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Direct contributions (weighted at 70%)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">36.3%</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">(25.4%)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">63.7%</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">(44.6%)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Indirect contributions (both financial and non-financial) (weighted at 30%)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">55%</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">(16.5%)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">45%</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">(13.5%)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Average percentage contributions (weighted 70:30)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">41.9%</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">58.1%</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Readjustment of ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I do not consider that any further adjustments to the weighted ratios of 41.9% to the wife and 58.1% to the husband are warranted to account for the factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter. Both parties asked me to take into account the period of rent-free occupation of the other spouse in a matrimonial asset for the period since the wife left the matrimonial home in March 2008. The fact is, however, that both parties have lived rent-free in a matrimonial asset and have not had to incur additional expense for housing since March 2007. To that extent, I find this a neutral factor. As I am applying a broad brush approach, I do not consider that the division of the matrimonial property will be more just or more equitable if I were to take into account the fact that the husband’s period of rent-free occupation is likely to be worth more than the wife’s given the relative sizes of the two properties. Again, if I have erred at all in this aspect of my decision, I have erred in favour of the husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Most convenient means of distribution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 I am now left to consider what is the most convenient means to distribute the matrimonial assets. To recap, the total value of the assets is about $16.583m. The wife is entitled to 41.9% of this sum or about $6.948m. That leaves $9.635 for the husband. My primary concern in this respect is to minimise the need to change the ownership of assets held in the parties’ names.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 I therefore order that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The wife and the husband are to retain the personal property in their respective names.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The husband is to transfer to the wife his interest in the property currently occupied by the wife and children.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The wife is to retain the two Hillcrest properties in her sole name.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As the value to the wife pursuant to orders (a) to (c) above is $5.86m, the husband shall pay to the wife the sum of $1.1m to make up the rest of her share of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) All other jointly-owned matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial home) are to be transferred to the husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Debts allegedly owed by the wife to the husband</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The husband further submits that the wife owes him the sum of $473,498.10. This, he submits, is the debt remaining due to him after netting off certain transfers of funds made between the spouses for “foreign exchange purposes” during the marriage. The wife disputes this claim. I decline to take this alleged debt into account in the division of matrimonial assets. If the wife is indeed indebted to the husband in this sum, he has a cause of action against her and is at liberty to recover that sum from her in civil proceedings. I do not consider a division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter to be the appropriate occasion on which to resolve the disputes of fact which underlie this claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I now turn to deal with the two remaining ancillary matters: maintenance for the wife and maintenance for the children.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Maintenance for the wife</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The wife does not ask to be awarded substantive maintenance now. But she submits that she should be awarded nominal maintenance now to preserve her right to seek substantive maintenance in the future in case her circumstances change. Counsel for the wife points out that the wife suffers from Graves’ Disease and could in future suffer a relapse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Having considered the matter, it is my decision not to grant the wife any maintenance at all, whether substantive or nominal. I have arrived at this decision for the following reasons. First, the wife is highly educated and financially independent. She earns slightly more than $15,000 a month. Second, the wife will be receiving under my order a substantial portion of the matrimonial assets, including the property that she and children currently occupy and a cash lump sum. That diminishes her need for periodic payments from the husband by way of maintenance for her own maintenance, whether now or in the future. Third, the wife comes from a well-to-do family. Her family members have extended a great deal of support to her over the years, both financial and non-financial. There is no reason to believe that that support will be withdrawn now or in the future. Finally, I note that the marriage between the parties was a rather short one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Given all of these factors, I do not think it would be fair to leave, hanging over the husband for the rest of his life, a possible future liability to maintain the wife for the rest of her life. In these circumstances, I award no maintenance to the wife now or in the future.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Maintenance for the children</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Under the existing maintenance order dated 7 January 2011, the husband has been paying $3,000 per month and 50% of certain specified costs incurred by the wife for the children upon the wife producing the relevant invoices and receipts.

I therefore exercise my power under s 112(g) of the Women’s Charter to order the husband to pay the wife, in addition to the sum of $1.1m found above (see [167(d)]), the sum of $42,547.02. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Future maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 As for future maintenance for the children, the wife asks that the husband be ordered to pay a fixed monthly sum of $4,500 for the daughter and $6,000 for the son.

But I am of the view that some of the household expenses for the children which the wife has listed in her table are on the high side. I refer, in particular, to the expenses relating to the two domestic helpers, listed at $2,443.50, and the expenses for “clothing/shoes/toys/ stationery”, listed as $1,300. I have therefore adjusted the figures relating to the household expenses of the children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 I therefore order that the husband is to pay a fixed monthly sum of $4,000 as maintenance for the daughter and $5,500 as maintenance for the son.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s counsel’s letter to the court requesting an opportunity to present further arguments dated 4 September 2015.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> He argues that I have fallen into error in calculating the parties’ direct contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets. More specifically, he says that my error is that I have pooled all of the matrimonial real property and then credited to each party as direct contributions only that party’s actual historical contributions. He argues that I should instead consider each item of matrimonial real property separately and credit each party with the present net value attributable to that party’s actual historical contribution to that item of matrimonial real property. He submits that I have adopted that approach in assessing each party’s direct contribution to the <span class="font-italic">remaining</span> matrimonial assets, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the matrimonial assets which are not real property; and he submits that consistency requires that I adopt the same approach to the matrimonial real property. The result of this error, he says, is to undervalue his direct contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets and to overvalue the wife’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 I set out below a series of tables produced by the husband which illustrate more clearly the nub of the husband’s argument. The tables set out on the left reflect my calculations set out in the analysis at [140] – [164] above and set out on the right the result of the approach advocated by the husband. As these are intended merely as illustrations, I have expressed all monetary figures in these tables in millions of dollars rounded off to only two decimal places.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 First, I set out a table comparing my calculation of the parties’ direct contributions with the husband’s proposed calculation. The effect of the husband’s calculation is to disregard the parties’ respective actual direct contributions and to allocate to himself all of the value of the matrimonial home and the Cairnhill property (on the basis that he alone made actual direct contributions towards acquiring them); to allocate to the wife all of the value of the Hillcrest properties (on the basis that she alone made actual direct contributions towards acquiring them); and to allocate to each of them half of the value of the property which the wife and children now occupy (on the basis that each of them made equal

matrimonial assets as $16.583m (see [146] above), the husband submits that he should be awarded 65.4% of that value amounting to a share of $10.84m, instead of 58.1% of that value amounting to a share of $9.64m. The husband cites the decision in <span class="font-italic">YG </span> (at [53]) as authority which considers the parties’ direct financial contributions a matrimonial asset in terms of the net value of the asset rather than by reference to the parties’ historical actual contribution towards the acquisition of that asset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The wife in response argues that the effect of the husband’s approach is to credit to each party as that party’s direct financial contribution to each item of matrimonial real property the capital gain attributable to each party’s actual direct contribution to that property at the time of acquisition. The wife submits that this is incorrect in principle and unsupported by precedent. She distinguishes <span class="font-italic">YG</span> on the grounds that the court there was dividing sale proceeds comprising only parties’ CPF funds used to acquire the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I have declined to hear the husband’s further arguments. I have done so for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 First, I do not consider that I have applied an approach to the matrimonial real property which is different from the approach which I have applied for the remaining matrimonial assets. My approach in respect of each matrimonial asset has been to value each party’s direct contributions to that asset as at the time the asset in question was acquired and became part of the pool of matrimonial assets. For the matrimonial real property, I have evidence before me on which to make the necessary findings of the parties’ historical direct contributions. For the matrimonial assets which are not real property, I do not have sufficient evidence before me on which to make those findings. In light of the evidential deficiency and adopting a broad brush approach, I have chosen to use the present value of the remaining matrimonial assets to calculate the parties’ direct contributions to these assets. I have done so not because I consider it appropriate to use the present value of any of these remaining matrimonial assets to make this calculation, but only because I consider the present value of the remaining matrimonial assets to be a reasonable proxy for each party’s historical actual direct contributions to those assets (see [151] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Second, I do not consider <span class="font-italic">YG</span> to be authority for the proposition advanced by the husband. In <span class="font-italic">YG</span>, the principal matrimonial asset to be divided was the matrimonial home. The court had before it unchallenged evidence that the husband had made direct contributions of 56% towards acquiring the matrimonial home while the wife had made direct contributions of 44% (<span class="font-italic">YG</span> at [49]). By the time of the ancillary proceedings, the matrimonial home had been sold for $428,000 (<span class="font-italic">YG </span>at [34]). The court thus valued each party’s direct contributions to the matrimonial home by applying the unchallenged direct contribution ratio to the net sale proceeds. It appears from the judgment in <span class="font-italic">YG</span> that the court did not have before it evidence of the actual contributions of the parties to the acquisition of the matrimonial home. Further, because the matrimonial home there had been sold, the parties’ direct interest in that asset had crystallised by the time the court came to value it. It is therefore not surprising that the court in <span class="font-italic">YG</span> used the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home to value the parties’ direct contributions to its acquisition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In the present case, I have evidence before me of the parties’ actual direct contributions towards the matrimonial real property. And unlike the remaining matrimonial assets, the capital appreciation on the matrimonial real property is substantial. There is simply no reason for me to attribute the substantial capital gains on each item of matrimonial real property to augment each party’s direct contributions, when those capital gains arise simply as a result of the effluxion of time and not through either party making a further and actual contribution of monetary value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Third, the effect of the husband’s method of calculation amounts to applying the classification method to each item of matrimonial real property. It requires a separate calculation of direct contributions for each such item. It is clear why the husband advocates this: by far the greatest capital appreciation – in both relative and absolute terms – has taken place in relation to the matrimonial home. The husband alone has made direct contributions to the acquisition of that asset.  His further arguments are therefore motivated by self-interest, not by any disinterested desire to correct what he considers to be an error or to achieve what he considers to be consistency in the division of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I do not consider that the husband’s approach will achieve a just and equitable division of the matrimonial property. For the reasons I have already given (see [103] above), I consider that a just and equitable division of all of the matrimonial property in this case points towards the global assessment method. Those reasons apply equally to the matrimonial <span class="font-italic">real</span> property. For those reasons, I consider it just and equitable to treat each party’s direct contribution towards each item of matrimonial real property to be a direct contribution to the pool of matrimonial real property and, ultimately, to the overall pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 I add a final point. Even if I had adopted the husband’s approach in calculating the parties’ direct contributions to the matrimonial real property, I do not consider it would have made a material difference to my final decision. The husband’s approach yields a ratio of 25.9% direct contribution to matrimonial real property for the wife and 74.1% for the husband (see [185] above).  If I had adopted the husband’s approach and arrived at the same ratio, I would not have considered it just and equitable to attach greater weight to the direct contributions to account for the short duration of the marriage and the large size of the pool of matrimonial assets. I would instead have weighted both direct and indirect contributions equally. If I had done that, I would have arrived at a final ratio for the division of all matrimonial property of 40.45% for the wife and 59.55% for the husband.  Adopting a broad brush approach and in light of the size of the total pool of all matrimonial assets, the variance between those figures and the final figures which I have arrived at (see [164] and [186] above) are immaterial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 For all of the foregoing reasons, I have made the orders summarised at [2] above, and which are set out in more detail at [64], [89], [94], [167], [172], [174], [177] and [181] of these grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Chee Meng SC, Sim Bock Eng, Sngeeta Rai and Wilbur Lim (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Imran H Khwaja and Edith Chen (Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
