<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        For ease of reference, Farida Begam

d/o Mohd Artham will be referred to as the appellant, and the Public Prosecutor as the respondent.

This was an appeal from the decision of the magistrate Gilbert Low ("the judge"), in which

he convicted the appellant of an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and acquitted her

of three other charges under the same section. The appellant was sentenced to three months

imprisonment. The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence. The respondent cross-appealed

against sentence. I dismissed the appellants appeals and allowed the respondents cross-appeal

and now give my reasons.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The charge</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The first three charges were irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal. The

fourth charge read as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">You are charged that you, on 30 August 1999, at Blk 496E Tampines Avenue 9

  #02-524, Singapore, being the employer of a domestic maid, one Khusniati Habib (female, 20 years

  of age), did voluntarily cause hurt to her, to wit, by hitting her head, face and chest with a

  wooden scrub and a slipper, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 323 of the

  Penal Code (Chapter 224) punishable under the aforesaid section read with section 73(2) of the

  Penal Code (Chapter 224).</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The evidence of the prosecution</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 Khusniati Habib ("PW4") started work in the appellants household

as a domestic maid on 13 July 1999. There were allegations of several other instances of abuse, but

the incident in question occurred on 30 August 1999 at about 7.30 am. PW4 was cleaning the floor

outside the flat with a long brush when the appellant told her that she was using the brush wrongly.

The appellant then hit PW4 on the head and upper body several times with the brush pole. She

subsequently hit PW4 hard on the face with a slipper. PW4 did not scream or cry for fear of

reprisals. The appellant then showed PW4 how to use the brush and PW4 duly complied.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 Later that morning, PW4 took the appellants daughter to school. One of PW4s

friends saw the injuries on her face and suggested she make a police report. They pleaded with a

passer-by, Rugayah bte Idris ("PW3") for help. PW3 took them to a police post, where a

report was lodged at 1.30 pm. The police took photographs of PW4s injuries at 3 pm. She was

examined by Dr Khor Chong Chneah ("PW2") at 9.40 pm. PW4 spent the night in police

custody. The next day, at 11 am, Sgt Sani b Tugiman (PW1) noticed that the area around PW4s eyes

had darkened. More photographs of PW4s face were taken.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The evidence of the defence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The appellant denied ever hitting PW4. Her evidence regarding the time at which

she was home on 30 August 1999 was inconsistent throughout the trial (see below). The defence

suggested two reasons for PW4s injuries. First, Shamsunisha d/o Mohd Ghouse ("DW3"),

the appellants aunt, said that PW4 had fallen twice, once forwards and once backwards, while

washing the kitchen floor on 29 August 1999. The appellant, DW3 and the appellants brother,

Mohamed Ali ("DW2"), said that PW4 only had slight bruises on her forehead at 11.30 am the

next day. Hence the second reason which the defence suggested was that PW4 inflicted the injuries on

herself sometime between 11.30 am and 1.30 pm on 30 August 1999, while she was not in the appellants

home.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 Furthermore, the appellant alleged that PW4 had twice stolen money and

valuables. The appellant made a police report on 30 August 1999 (the very day that PW4 had made <i>her</i>

police report) alleging theft by PW4.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The magistrates decision</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The judge set out the prosecutions and the defences evidence. He

described the impeachment exercises against PW4 and the appellant. He ruled that the formers

credit was not impeached, but that the latters was. He accepted PW4s version of events, and

PW2s explanation of the possible cause of PW4s injuries. In sentencing the appellant, he bore

in mind the fact that she was a first offender, had two children and was 27 years old at the time of

the offence. He imposed what he believed was the benchmark of three months imprisonment.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Issues</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 The issues in this appeal were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a The credibility of PW4 and Staff Sergeant Patrick Lim ("PW6").</p>
<p align="justify">b The credibility of the defence witnesses.</p>
<p align="justify">c Whether the elements of the offence were present.</p>
<p align="justify">d Whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate or excessive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The first issue: credibility of PW4 and PW6</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 A judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all

of the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a His demeanour.</p>
<p align="justify">b The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">c The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his

  evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary

  evidence or exhibits).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 The starting point in relation to findings based on demeanour was <i>Yap Giau

Beng Terence v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47088&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 656</a>:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial

  judges findings of fact, <i>especially where they hinge on the trial judges assessment of

  the credibility and veracity of witnesses</i>, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or

  against the weight of evidence (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This was relevant to all the witnesses, but it was especially so to PW4. In PW4s

case, while her evidence <i>in relation to the particular incident</i> was generally internally

consistent, there was little extrinsic evidence with which her evidence could be compared. No other

prosecution witness was present at the scene of the incident, and the medical evidence did not rule

out a combination of falls and self-infliction as the cause (see below). Hence the judges

assessment of her demeanour was significant. In contrast, in PW6s case, there was external

consistency between the content of his evidence and the actual document on which the appellants

statement was made (see below). In the case of the defence witnesses, there were both internal

inconsistencies in the content of individual witnesses evidence and external inconsistencies

between the content of different witnesses evidence <i>inter se</i>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 PW4 was only 19 years old at the time of the incident, and had only received

six years of education. The judge was of the opinion that she was nave and not of high

intelligence. The defence attempted to impeach PW4s credit, based on inconsistencies between her

police report and her testimony. There was only one issue which could be called a

"discrepancy": the police report mentioned "daily" abuse but the appellant was

charged in relation to only four incidents. Staff Sergeant Lee Kim Siah (PW5) explained that PW4 had

mentioned other incidents of abuse, but as the details of these were unclear, the appellant was not

charged in relation to them. The judge found that PW4s credit was not impeached. The judge was

also careful to state that the appellants acquittal on three other charges was not due to PW4s

unreliability, but because of the lack of specific details in her evidence. However, PW4 remembered

the incident in question well, because it was the most serious assault.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 The next issue involved PW6s credibility. On 30 August 1999, the appellant

made a statement, which was recorded in English by PW6. She later claimed that she did not

understand the statement as she had only been educated up to Standard Two, in Tamil, in India. This

was rejected for two reasons. First, PW6 was not an interested witness; he was merely doing his job.

Secondly, the circumstances (as related by PW6 and evidenced by the document) showed that the

appellant understood the statement:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a PW6 said it was his practice to ask the maker of the statement in which

  language he wanted it recorded. In this case, the appellant wanted it recorded in English.</p>
<p align="justify">b PW6 and the appellant had communicated in simple English.</p>
<p align="justify">c When the statement was read back to the appellant, she asked for certain

  amendments to be made; when they were made, she countersigned against them.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The second issue: credibility of the defence witnesses</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 DW2 and DW3, being relatives of the appellant, were interested witnesses. In <i>Thirumalai

Kumar v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11113&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 434</a>, the court said of the appellants wife and mother: "Both

were interested parties and there was every reason to treat their evidence with caution."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 There were two main issues in which material discrepancies in the defences

evidence surface. First, the allegations of theft revealed the following weaknesses:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a Neither the appellant, DW2 nor DW3 could remember the exact dates of the two

  alleged incidents.</p>
<p align="justify">b In relation to the first alleged incident, the appellant said in her

  statement to the police that she found the missing money in PW4s bag. In her examination in

  chief, she said it was DW3 who had found the money. Her explanation for the discrepancy was that

  they were both at the scene.</p>
<p align="justify">c The appellant said she did not tell Noor Jehan bte Mohd Nor

  ("DW4"), through whom she had employed PW4, about the thefts, but DW4 said that she did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 The second issue was when the appellant was at home on 30 August 1999. The

appellant kept changing her evidence:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a In her examination-in-chief, she said that she left at 7.30 am, to go to

  Kandang Kerbau to prepare for her late fathers prayers.</p>
<p align="justify">b During cross-examination, she said that she left at 7 am, to deliver goods

  with her husband. She returned at 2.30 pm.</p>
<p align="justify">c During the impeachment exercise, she said she left at about 10 am.</p>
<p align="justify">d When she was cross-examined further, she said that she left at 7 am.</p>
<p align="justify">e During re-examination, she said that she left at 7 am and returned at 9 am.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The third issue: were the elements of the offence present?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 Section 321 of the Penal Code provides for the offence of voluntarily causing

hurt:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">321. Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any

  person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does

  thereby cause hurt to any person, is said [to] "voluntarily to cause hurt".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 The first element was that the appellant intended to cause hurt or knew that

her actions were likely to cause hurt. As the prosecutions evidence has been accepted over the

defences version, it was plain that the appellant intended to cause hurt to PW4.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 The second element was that the victim was hurt. Section 319 defines

"hurt":</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">319. Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to

  cause hurt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">PW2s medical report noted that PW4s injuries included: hematomas and

lesions over the scalp; bruises over the temples, nose and eyelids; swelling of the eyes and a

bruise over the shoulder. These fell within s 319.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 The third element was that the appellants actions <i>caused</i> the hurt.

PW2 opined that the above-mentioned injuries probably occurred within 24 hours of his examining PW4.

He also thought that they were caused by a blunt object. First, the defence alleged that the bruises

on PW4s forehead were caused by her falls. PW2 thought this unlikely because:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a A fall could only lead to one of the three hematomas on the scalp. Moreover,

  it was unlikely that the hematomas were caused on different occasions.</p>
<p align="justify">b A face-down fall could not explain the bruises on PW4s temples, which were

  on the sides of her face.</p>
<p align="justify">c Looking at the distribution of the injuries, they were unlikely to have been

  caused by a fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In any case, the falls could not explain her other injuries.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 The second allegation was that PW4 had inflicted the injuries upon herself.

PW2 also thought this unlikely. He said that, while each individual injury could have been

self-inflicted, it was unlikely that all of them were inflicted at the same time. Yet, the medical

evidence suggested that most of the injuries were sustained at the same time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 The final allegation was that PW4 sustained the injuries through a combination

of falls and self-infliction. PW agreed that this was possible. However, the rest of the evidence

made this explanation unlikely (see above). There was also no credible reason for PW4s

self-infliction. Moreover, it was unlikely that she could have inflicted such injuries on herself

within two hours, and presumably in public. The irresistible inference was that the appellant had

caused PW4s injuries.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The fourth issue: sentence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 The punishment for an offence under s 321 is set out in s 323:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">323. Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily

  causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with

  fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, as the victim in this case was a domestic maid and the perpetrator her

employer, the court should also have considered s 73:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">73. --(1) Subsection (2) shall apply where an employer of a domestic maid or a

  member of the employer's household is convicted of </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) an offence of causing hurt or grievous hurt to any domestic maid employed

    by the employer punishable under section 323, 324 or 325</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) Where an employer of a domestic maid or a member of the employer's

  household is convicted of an offence described in subsection (1)(a) <i>the</i> <i>court may

  sentence the employer</i> of the domestic maid or the member of his household, as the case may be,

  <i>to one and a half times the amount of punishment to which he would otherwise have been liable

  for that offence</i>. (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 There were no real mitigating factors here. The fact that the appellant had no

antecedents itself did not carry much weight. As was said in <i>PP v Tan Fook Sum</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48341&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 2 SLR 523</a>:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The fact that the respondent has no previous convictions is of little

  assistance to him. The inference here must be that the respondent as a first offender and being of

  good character is a mitigating factor the weight to be given to this would be greater if there

  were positive evidence as to character rather than the negative inference from the absence of

  other convictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 There were, however, several aggravating factors:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a PW4 sustained rather serious injuries, concentrated on the head and face,

  which are vulnerable parts of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">b The appellant did not use her bare hands, but used a wooden pole and a

  slipper.</p>
<p align="justify">c The appellant was in a position of authority over PW4.</p>
<p align="justify">d PW4 was a vulnerable victim. Maids have been recognised as a category of

  persons in need of greater protection.</p>
<p align="justify">e The attack was unprovoked.</p>
<p align="justify">f The appellant had shown no remorse. She had not apologised to PW4 nor paid

  her any compensation. She even tried to cast aspersions on PW4s character during the trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 The precedents showed that, where no injuries or minor injuries are caused,

only a fine was imposed. It was clear that in this case, a custodial sentence was warranted. The

respondent cited <i>Murnita bte Mujini v PP </i>MA 293/2000, whose facts were similar to the present

case. In that case, the appellant tied the victim to a ladder and beat her with a wooden pole,

causing cuts and bruises all over the latters body. The appellant was also a first offender and

27 years old at the time of the offence. The difference was that she pleaded guilty. On appeal, the

court sentenced her to 15 months imprisonment on the s 323 charge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 In imposing custodial sentences, the courts in cases like <i>Wong Suet Peng v

PP </i>(MA 170/2000) and <i>Chung Poh Chee v PP </i>(MA 71/2000) have recognised the need for

deterrence and the importance of public policy in this area. The judge in this case had overlooked

these concerns, for he did not even mention s 73 and the legislative intent behind it. During the

parliamentary debate on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill on 20 April 1998, the Minister for Home

Affairs listed the reasons for the enhanced penalties:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a Maids are especially vulnerable to abuse by their employers because they

  "work within the confines of their employers home for 24 hours of the day are isolated

  from the rest of society and depend on their employer for food and lodging."</p>
<p align="justify">b Maid abuse should not be tolerated in a gracious society, which is what

  Singapore aspires to be.</p>
<p align="justify">c Maid abuse is also detrimental to Singapores international reputation and

  bilateral relations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 Section 73 was passed in response to an alarming increase in maid abuse cases

from 1994 to 1997. Maid abusers have certain misconceptions which must be corrected. A maid sells

her services; she does not sell her person. An employer should not exploit his maids dependence

on him for food and lodging, for these are basic rights. A maids abased social status does not

mean that she is any less of a human being and any less protected by the law.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 There exists in Singapore a rather unique situation where foreign domestic

help is affordable for a large part of the population. Singaporeans should not take this situation

for granted, for the luxury of having foreign help depends greatly on good relations with

neighbouring states. It is probably not a good thing that the key criterion for employing a maid is

financial ability; but it would of course be an administrative nightmare if the authorities had to

check on every maids living conditions and on the household members. Just because the authorities

do not scrutinise a potential employer, before he employs a maid and periodically while she is in

his employ, he should not think that he will not be punished for any offences he commits against

her.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 For the reasons above, the appellants appeals against conviction and

sentence were dismissed, the respondents cross-appeal against sentence was allowed and the

sentence was enhanced to nine months imprisonment.</p>
