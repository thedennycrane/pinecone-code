<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal (Civil Appeal No 64 of 2009)
                    by one Thio Keng Poon (the plaintiff in both Suit No. 734 of 2008/S
                    (“Suit 734”) and Suit No. 10 of 2008/T
                    (“Suit 10”) below and is hereinafter referred to as
                    “the Appellant”) against the decisions (in respect of both suits)
                    made by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Thio Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn and Others and Another
                    Suit </em>[2009] SGHC 135.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In Suit 734, the Appellant alleged that he
                    was “surreptitiously”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> removed from his offices of
                    Chairman, Managing Director and Director in both Malaysia Dairy Industries Pte
                    Ltd (“Malaysia Dairy”) and Modern Dairy International Pte Ltd
                    (“Modern Dairy”) in a manner which did not accord with the
                    Articles of Association (“AA”) of the aforementioned companies
                    (“the breach of AA issue”). In Suit 10, the plaintiff’s
                    case was premised on minority oppression, breach of contract, and breach of an
                    understanding and assurance (“the Minority Oppression issue”). The
                    Judge dismissed the Appellant’s claims in both suits upon a “no
                    case to answer” submission at the trial below. Separately, the Appellant
                    has also filed an appeal (in Civil Appeal No. 71 of 2009/Q) against an Order of
                    Court made by the Judge, disallowing the amendments proposed by the Appellant in
                    relation to the 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph of the draft Judgment
                    put forward by the Respondents and relating to their counterclaim in
                    Suit 10.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant is the founder and was the
                    Managing Director of Malaysia Dairy, a company incorporated in Singapore in 1963
                    pursuant to a joint venture between the Appellant and the Australian Dairy
                    Produce Board (the “ADPB”). In 1968, the Appellant bought out
                    ADPB, and became both the Chairman and the Managing Director of Malaysia
                    Dairy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The year 1969 saw two developments. First,
                    Malaysia Milk Sdn Bhd (“Malaysia Milk”) was incorporated in
                    Malaysia as a wholly owned subsidiary of Malaysia Dairy. Its operations, which
                    began in 1977, were based in Malaysia. Secondly, Thio Holdings (Private) Limited
                    (“Thio Holdings”) was set up as an investment holding company for
                    the various business ventures entered into by the members of the Thio family.
                    Currently, Thio Holdings holds 30% of the issued share capital of Malaysia
                    Dairy. Since then, the business of the Appellant’s companies has expanded
                    exponentially and additional companies have been set up beyond Singapore and
                    Malaysia. Indeed, the Thio family currently owns and manages the following group
                    of companies (“the Thio Group”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">In so far as the above companies are concerned, we note
                    that the ones in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Brunei do not feature in this
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Over the years, the Appellant transferred his
                    shares in the various companies in the Thio Group, as well as to cause these
                    companies to issue bonus shares, to the other members of the family for
                    “no consideration”. However, it will soon be seen that the
                    Appellant himself had also benefitted from his well-calculated moves to transfer
                    a certain portion of ownership in these companies to the rest of his
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As is common in many family-run companies, from
                    1983, Pyn, being the eldest son, began assisting the Appellant in the running of
                    the business of the Thio Group and was thereafter in 1995 appointed Deputy
                    Managing Director. Based on the sterling financial results of the companies and
                    the supporting evidence from Serene, it cannot be disputed that Pyn successfully
                    took the reins of the Thio Group and steered the Group’s business to even
                    greater heights. The Appellant, however, became dissatisfied because his
                    previously unchecked powers of control over the business were progressively
                    being reined in by his family members. The Appellant appeared to be labouring
                    under the belief that, as the founder of Malaysia Dairy and the patriarch of the
                    family, he was entitled to retain the various offices in the Thio Group on a
                    permanent basis until such time as he chose to retire, or until he passes away,
                    whichever first occurs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There were various disputes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> in
                    the Thio family, one of which arose as a result of the Appellant’s
                    proposal in 1995 to restructure the respective shareholdings of his children so
                    as to provide for his grandsons (Ghee’s twin sons who happen to be the
                    Appellant’s only grandsons). These disputes involved various share
                    restructuring exercises which were proposed by the Appellant. In an attempt to
                    resolve these disputes once and for all, the Appellant and the rest of the Thio
                    family eventually entered into a Deed of Settlement on 23 December 2005
                    (“Deed of Settlement”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, which bound the Appellant
                    and the 1<sup>st</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    Respondents (the 1<sup>st</sup> to

                    conclusively settled the distribution of the shares in the Thio Group
                    (“save for interests in shares arising from subscriptions or investments
                    or rights arising after the date of the Deed of Settlement”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>).
                    Indeed, pursuant to the Deed of Settlement, the Appellant received shares (which
                    had a total net tangible asset value in excess of $24 million as at
                    31 December 2005) from Pyn, Wee and Thio Holdings. Nevertheless, Pyn and
                    Wee still jointly retained majority control over Thio Holdings and Malaysia
                    Dairy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As it turned out, however, the Deed of
                    Settlement did not, contrary to expectations, precipitate harmony within the
                    family. Indeed, disputes unfortunately continued to plague the Thio family which
                    remained a cauldron of animosity. Among the disputes were a demand by the
                    Appellant for a $10 million birthday gift<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> and a proposal by the Appellant to
                    re-assert control over the Thio Group. But he did not succeed in
                        either<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. Other
                    altercations appeared to be petty ones which were invariably
                    “resolved” after one party gave in (reluctantly or otherwise) to
                    the other. However, a significant event occurred in 2007 which became the
                    genesis for the removal of the Appellant from his various positions in the Thio
                    Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 22 October 2007, Malaysia Dairy
                    decided to engage an audit and assurance firm, Ernst &amp; Young
                    (“E&amp;Y”), to conduct an independent review of the travel
                    expenses incurred by the Appellant for the period 1 January 2005 to 30
                    September 2007 as recorded in the accounting books and records of Malaysia
                    Dairy, Malaysia Milk and Cotra Sdn.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After E&amp;Y reported their findings on the
                    review, the Appellant was shortly thereafter removed from his positions as
                    Chairman, Managing Director and Director of Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy on
                    or around 20 November 2007 and 21 November 2007 respectively. The
                    impetus for the Appellant’s removal was the discovery by E&amp;Y that
                    there had been 9 occasions where the Appellant had claimed for reimbursement of
                        <em>air ticket</em> expenses for the same trip from
                    both Malaysia Dairy and Cotra Sdn (“the Double Claims”). In
                    essence, what the Appellant did was to claim the cost of the same trips
                        <em>twice</em>, once from Malaysia Dairy (for the sum
                    of S$ 45,529.64) and again from Cotra Sdn (for the sum of S$ 48,713.67). In his
                    defence, the Appellant insisted that the monetary value of the Double Claims
                    which he had made against Malaysia Dairy and Cotra Sdn was in fact less than
                    what he would have been entitled to claim for the air-tickets (for one person)
                    plus the <em>hotel</em> expenses which he had incurred on
                    those trips.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the light of the above findings by E&amp;Y,
                    Pyn called for a meeting of the Board of Directors of Malaysia Dairy to be held
                    on 20 November 2007 (“the 20 November meeting”).
                        Notice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> was given to all the directors of Malaysia
                    Dairy save for the Appellant who was then overseas (<em>ie</em>, not in Singapore or West Malaysia). According to the notice,
                    the 20 November meeting was convened to discuss the E&amp;Y report as well
                    as the removal of the Appellant as “Director, Managing Director and/ or
                    Chairman”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Although notice in respect of the
                    20 November meeting was not given to the Appellant, Serene informed the
                    Appellant’s secretary, Teo Beng Koon (“Teo”), that the Board
                    of Malaysia Dairy would be meeting on 20 November 2007 to discuss the
                    removal of the Appellant from the positions he held in the company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    Teo then telephoned the Appellant (who was then overseas) in an attempt to relay
                    the information which Serene provided. When the Appellant did not answer
                    Teo’s telephone call, he sent the Appellant text messages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, the Appellant’s solicitors (Messrs Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP)
                    were informed of the 20 November meeting and duly sent an e-mail to the
                    Respondents’ solicitors stating that the Appellant “objects to the
                    convening of a Board meeting of [Malaysia Dairy] at such short notice on such a
                    serious matter, especially when [Malaysia Dairy] knows full well that [the
                    Appellant] is out of the country for a medical procedure”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having reviewed the E&amp;Y report, the Board
                    of Directors of Malaysia Dairy (seven directors, being the Appellant’s
                    three sons, Lim Choo Peng (“Lim”), Madam Kwik, Wendy and Serene,
                    were present) at the 20 November meeting unanimously approved the removal
                    of the Appellant as Director, Managing Director and Chairman of Malaysia Dairy
                    in accordance with Article 88(c) of Malaysia Dairy’s Articles of
                    Association (“AA”), as well as an authorised signatory of Malaysia
                    Dairy’s bank accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A members’ resolution at the
                        44<sup>th</sup> Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
                    of Malaysia Dairy held on 21 November 2007 “approve[d], confirm[ed]
                    and ratifi[ed]” the Board’s removal of the Appellant from his
                    positions as Director, Managing Director and Chairman in Malaysia Dairy. At this
                    AGM, the Appellant was represented by his proxy, Wendy Lee, who opposed the
                    ratification of the Board’s removal of the Appellant. It should be noted
                    that all the members of the Thio family were present (either in person or by
                    proxy) at the AGM on 21 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Turning to Modern Dairy, the Appellant also
                    suffered the same fate there. By a resolution in writing dated 7 November
                    2007, the Board of Modern Dairy resolved to hold its AGM on 21 November
                    2007. Pyn was the appointed representative of Malaysia Dairy at Modern
                    Dairy’s AGM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Consequently, the Appellant was removed as
                    Director, Managing Director and Chairman of Modern Dairy and as its authorised
                    bank signatory after Modern Dairy resolved that the Appellant be requested to
                    vacate and by reason thereof was deemed to have vacated his offices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> We should
                    add that the Appellant was also removed as a director of Thio Holding and United
                    Realty. However, he is not challenging his removal as a director of these two
                    companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Following the Appellant’s removal from
                    the various offices, the Boards of Directors of the companies in the Thio Group
                    in Singapore consisted of his five children (except for the
                        1<sup>st</sup> daughter, Vicki) and Madam Kwik. Pyn and Wee,
                    who collectively own 51% of the shares in Thio Holdings, now have effective
                    control over the entire Thio Group. The Appellant, on the other hand, is
                    currently a minority shareholder in the Thio Group, holding only 4.75% in Thio
                    Holdings, 11.5% in Malaysia Dairy and 10% in United Realty.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">To complete the factual matrix, we should add that prior to the trial
                    below, the Appellant had on two separate occasions sought an interim injunction
                    to restrain the Respondents from carrying out their decisions to remove him from
                    the offices he held in those companies. On both occasions, he
                        failed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Appellant then brought the
                    present two actions, the details of which are set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In addition to seeking reinstatement to the
                    offices at Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy to which he was deemed to have
                    vacated, the Appellant also sought payment by Malaysia Dairy of arrears of his
                    monthly salary of $70,000 from 21 November 2007, which was the date of his
                    removal. On the other hand, Malaysia Dairy counter-claimed that the Appellant
                    had breached his fiduciary duties owed to it by making the Double
                Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The first issue which the Judge addressed (as
                    a “preliminary observation”) was the effect and significance of a
                    submission of “no case to answer” by the Respondents at the close
                    of the Appellant’s case. The Judge was of the view that the Appellant had
                    failed to discharge his burden of proof in relation to both Suit 10
                    (dealing with the Minority Oppression issue) and Suit 734 (involving the
                    Breach of AA issue). Consequently, she found that there was, indeed, no case to
                    answer and the Appellant’s claims for both suits were dismissed. The Judge
                    further granted interlocutory judgment to Malaysia Diary on its counterclaim
                    against the Appellant in Suit 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit 10 (“Minority Oppression”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We will now turn to briefly analyse the case
                    which was presented to the Judge in both of the two suits. In the Minority
                    Oppression suit, the Appellant alleged that the Respondents had conducted the
                    affairs of Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy and exercised their powers as
                    directors of those companies<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>:-</p>

                            transferred his shares in the Thio Group to his wife and children and
                            thus reduced his holdings in the Thio Group to that of a minority
                            (“the Understanding”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">An assurance was made by Pyn and Wee to Wendy,
                            Serene and Vicki that they would not seek to remove the Appellant from
                            his various positions in the Thio Group (“the
                            Assurance”).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant therefore contended that he was removed from his
                    positions in the Thio Group in breach of the Understanding and the
                    Assurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Understanding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It appeared from the evidence that the alleged
                    Understanding was really a unilateral assumption or belief on the part of the
                    Appellant as the same was never uttered by the Appellant to his wife or
                    children. His family members were not privy to what he was thinking. In essence,
                    the Understanding was solely based on the implicit trust which the Appellant had
                    in his wife and children. The Appellant <em>expected</em>
                    that in return for his gift of shares to his family members, they would concur
                    to him retaining sole overall control over the entire Thio Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Appellant further
                    elaborated on <em>the terms</em> of the Understanding as
                        follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Appellant would be entitled to <em>participate in the management</em> of the Thio Group
                            to the extent that the Appellant desired until the Appellant decided to
                            relinquish his right to participate;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Appellant would <em>retain his

                            until he decided to relinquish these positions; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Appellant would have the <em>final decision in respect of any salaries and fees</em>

                            himself, of the companies in the Thio Group.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At this juncture, in order to better
                    appreciate why the Understanding arose in the Appellant’s mind, it is
                    necessary that we allude to the Appellant’s evidence. The Appellant said
                    that he began to transfer his shares, and issue bonus shares, to his children
                    and wife (<em>ie</em>, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    to 7<sup>th</sup> Respondents) when Pyn and Wee were aged 12 and
                    5 years old respectively. According to him, his intention behind the provision
                    of shares for his family was three-fold.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> First, he wanted to give his
                    family a certain degree of ownership in his business. Second, he wanted to make
                    provision for their well-being after his death. Finally, he wanted to minimise
                    estate duty for his family. Furthermore, the Appellant gradually relinquished
                    the overall management of the business in the Thio Group after he handed the
                    reins over Malaysia Dairy to Pyn by appointing him as its Deputy Managing
                    Director in 1995. In that same year, the Appellant also retired from his
                    positions as Managing Director of Malaysia Milk and Cotra Sdn and these
                    positions were handed over to Lim. The Appellant averred that all these moves
                    were executed by him on the basis that the Understanding existed and operated
                    among all the members of the Thio family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Assurance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Turning next to the question as to how the
                    Assurance arose, the Appellant alleged that prior to the execution of the Deed
                    of Settlement, and pursuant to and consistent with the Understanding, both Pyn
                    and Wee assured the Appellant’s daughters that the Appellant would not be
                    removed from his positions in the various companies in the Thio Group
                    (“the Assurance”). Vicki then communicated the Assurance to the
                    Appellant via the company secretary of Thio Holdings before the Appellant signed
                    the Deed of Settlement. In this connection, the Appellant argued that he signed
                    the Deed of Settlement in reliance on the Assurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We note, however, that for the purposes of the
                    present appeal, the Appellant has abandoned his case based on the existence of
                    the Assurance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Indeed, in his written submissions to
                    this court, the Appellant conceded that he “was unable to establish the
                    existence of the Assurance at trial, and (will) not persist on that at the
                    hearing of this appeal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> He, however, submits that the
                    non-existence of the Assurance “does not detract from the existence of
                    the Understanding”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Double Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Appellant did not deny making the Double
                    Claims. His explanation, however, was that he had travelled with a female
                    companion and had he submitted a claim for hotel expenses, his family would come
                    to know of his extramarital affair, which he wanted to keep under wraps so as to
                    maintain family harmony. According to the Appellant, the cost of the airline
                    ticket was always less than that of the hotel accommodation. Hence, by claiming
                    for two airline tickets for each trip instead of a single airline ticket plus
                    the cost of hotel accommodation, he was effectively out of pocket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The point he underscored
                    was that he had not claimed more than what he was entitled to claim as
                    reimbursements from the companies. However, the Judge noted that the Appellant
                    was not able to substantiate his assertion that the hotel expenses were in fact
                    more than the cost of the second ticket.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Counterclaim by the Respondents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As regards the counterclaim by the
                    Respondents, the latter have, in essence, relied on the findings of E&amp;Y to
                    aver that the Appellant had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties owed to
                    Malaysia Dairy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit 734 (“Breach of AA”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this action, the Appellant contended that
                    he had been removed from his offices as Director, Managing Director and Chairman
                    of both Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy in breach of the AA of both companies.
                    In so far as Malaysia Dairy was concerned, the underlying basis for his
                    contention was that Article 88(c) of Malaysia Dairy’s AA was not
                    complied with and that therefore Malaysia Diary’s attempt to remove the
                    Appellant was wholly invalid because no request was made to him to resign as a
                    director as required under that article. Article 88(c) of Malaysia
                    Diary’s AA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The office of director shall, <em>ipso facto</em>, be
                        vacated:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) If he shall be requested to vacate office by all the other Directors,
                        they pass a resolution that he has been so requested and by reason thereof
                        has vacated his office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellant further argued that since the
                    Directors’ resolution passed on 20 November 2007 was ineffective, it
                    followed that the resolution passed at the AGM of 21 November 2007 was
                    consequently also of no effect because it merely “approve[d], confirm[ed]
                    and ratifi[ed]” the Board’s purported removal of the Appellant on
                    20 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     A similar argument to the above was made in
                    relation to the resolution passed at the AGM of Modern Dairy on 21 November
                    2007 which was worded in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Thio Keng Poon be requested to vacate, and by reason thereof is
                        deemed to have vacated, the office as a Director, Managing Director and
                        Chairman of the Company with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant averred that the Resolution of 21 November 2007 was
                    again not effective in removing him as the Chairman, Managing Director and
                    Director of Modern Dairy because it was passed in contravention of
                    Article 82(g) of the Modern Dairy AA, as no request was made to him to
                    vacate his office on or before 21 November 2007. Article 82(g) of the
                    Modern Dairy AA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The office of director shall become vacant if the director –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">be <em>requested in writing</em> by all his
                        Co-Directors to resign.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At this juncture, we should explain that in
                    the course of the trial, as well as for the present appeal, the Appellant
                    accepted that Article 82(g) was in fact <em>not</em>
                    part of the Modern Dairy AA (although the Judge had specifically considered
                    Article 82(g) of the Modern Dairy AA in her findings). The correct position
                    is that Article 82(g) was in fact part of a <em>proposed</em> set of Articles that was not passed eventually.
                    However, notwithstanding the non-existence of Article 82(g), the Appellant
                    argued in the alternative that there was absent a valid resolution to remove him
                    pursuant to the only relevant article, Article 71, the material portion of
                    which reads as follows: “The company may by ordinary resolution remove
                    any director before the expiration of his period of office…”. The
                    Appellant, therefore, contended that he had not been effectively removed and
                    that he continued to hold those offices because the resolution of
                    21 November 2007 was <em>prima facie</em> invalid
                    (since it stated that a request be made to the Appellant to resign and, as it
                    turned out, <em>no</em> prior request had in fact been made
                    to the Appellant to vacate his office).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings by the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Judge dismissed both actions brought by
                    the Appellant and allowed the Respondents’ counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   Suit 10</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In relation to Suit 10 (the Minority
                    Oppression issue), the Judge held that the Understanding did not in fact exist.
                    It was purely something that existed in the Appellant’s own mind. Indeed,
                    the Appellant’s evidence was that he never discussed the Understanding
                    with any of his children, although he alleged that he had discussed it with his
                    wife. In essence, the Understanding was unspoken and therefore, there was no way
                    his family members could have known about it or of what he had in
                mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Judge noted that the Appellant was unable
                    to specify precisely the terms of the Understanding. Moreover, the Appellant had
                    also failed to mention the Understanding to the Respondents when on numerous
                    occasions it would have been appropriate and advantageous to have brought it
                    up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Another important point which the Judge
                    commented on was that as clause 15 of the Deed of Settlement expressly
                    provided that the Deed superseded all prior discussions and agreements relating
                    to the shares, this would necessarily mean that whatever previous understandings
                    or agreement which might have existed between the parties prior to the execution
                    of the Deed will no longer have any effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As regards the Assurance, the Judge found that
                    the evidence adduced by the Appellant was “troubling”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> First, Serene who
                    was one of the parties to the Assurance, testified that she was not aware of any
                    such Assurance. Secondly, Teo revealed in court that Vicki had informed him that
                    there was such an Assurance on the day of the signing of the Deed of Settlement.
                    Yet, Vicki did not inform the Appellant directly when the Appellant was also
                    present on the occasion. Thirdly, the terms of the Assurance were contrary to
                    the spirit and letter of both clauses 13 and 15 of the Deed of
                    Settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In any event, the Judge also held that the
                    Appellant was represented at the AGM of Malaysia Dairy on 21 November 2007
                    by a proxy who was given ample opportunity to question the E&amp;Y report and or
                    make representations but had failed to do either. As for the AGM of Modern Dairy
                    held on 21 November 2007, she found that the Appellant did not have any
                    standing to sue under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed)(“the Companies Act”) because he was not a member
                    of Modern Dairy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   Suit 734</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In so far as Suit 734 (the Breach of AA
                    issue) was concerned, the Judge also found in favour of the Respondents. She
                    held that as regards the meeting of 20 November 2007 of Malaysia Dairy,
                    there was no requirement to notify the Appellant, who was then overseas, of it
                    because Article 112 of Malaysia Dairy’s AA provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]t shall not be necessary to give notice of a meeting of the Board to
                        any Director for the time being absent from Singapore and West
                            Malaysia<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Further, the Judge invoked s 392(2) of
                    the Companies Act to find that the resolution of the Board of Malaysia Dairy and
                    the resolution of the AGM of the company the next day were valid as no
                    “substantial injustice” was shown to have been caused to the
                    Appellant. Consequently, she held at [81] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Granted, the [Appellant] was not requested to vacate office by all the
                        other directors pursuant to Article 88(c) of the [Malaysia Dairy]
                        Articles and the notice in relation to [Malaysia Dairy]’s
                            44<sup>th</sup> AGM did not contain sufficient
                        information to enable a prudent member to decide whether or not to attend
                        the meeting. However, a defect in the notice would not invalidate a meeting
                        unless, as provided by s 392(2) of the [Companies] Act, substantial
                        injustice was caused to the [Appellant] which cannot be remedied by any
                        order of the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary Issues of “No case to answer” &amp;
                “Introduction of new points in this appeal”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Before moving on to discuss the main issues of
                    this appeal, it is necessary to dispose of two preliminary issues. The first
                    relates to the Appellant’s contention that an adverse inference <em>ought to<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></em> have been drawn
                    against the Respondents for having made a submission of no case to answer. The
                    essence of the Appellant’s point is that “[a] party who is in
                    control of material evidence on an issue in an action who fails to produce that
                    evidence to the court is vulnerable to an adverse inference being drawn against
                    him under section 116(g) of the Evidence Act”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We see no merit in this averment. It is
                    settled principle that the legal burden to prove a case always rests with the
                    plaintiff. It is only when a <em>prima facie</em> case has
                    been established by the plaintiff that the burden shifts to the defendant. A
                    plaintiff cannot simply rely on s 116(g) to discharge his primary burden of
                    proof of establishing a case against the defendant. But once some <em>prima facie</em> case is established and the defendant
                    chooses to submit a no case to answer, then that failure to offer evidence could
                    be fatal to the defendant’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Wisniewski v Central Manchester Health
                        Authority</em> [1998] 5 PIQR 324 at 340, Brooke LJ made
                    the following pertinent observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)   <em>In certain
                            circumstances</em> a court <em>may</em> be
                        entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence or silence of a witness
                        who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in an
                        action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   If a court is willing to draw such inferences, they
                        may go to strengthen the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party
                        or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably
                        have been expected to call the witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)   There must, however, have been some evidence, however
                        weak, adduced by the former on the matter in question before the court is
                        entitled to draw the desired inference: <em>in other words,
                            there must be a case to answer on that issue</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)   If the reason for the witness’s absence or
                        silence satisfies the court, then no such adverse inference may be drawn.
                        If, on the other hand, there is some credible explanation given, even if it
                        not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his/her
                        absence or silence may be reduced or nullified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     These principles as distilled by
                    Brooke LJ were alluded to and endorsed by the High Court in <em>Cheong Ghim Fah &amp; Anor v Murtigian s/o Rangasamy</em>
                    [2004] 1 SLR 628 at [42] - [43]. The law on this was also recently
                    applied by the High Court in <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian
                        Wei</em> [2009] SGHC 31 where the judge stated as follows at
                    [209]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agree with the defendants that the test of whether there is no case to
                        answer is whether the plaintiff’s evidence at face value establishes
                        no case in law or whether the evidence led by the plaintiff is so
                        unsatisfactory or unreliable that its burden of proof has not been
                        discharged (<em>Bansal Hermant Govindprasad; Lim Swee Khiang
                            and Sukhpreet Kaur</em>). However, <em>this does
                            not mean that an adverse inference will be drawn immediately against the
                            defendants simply because they chose to submit on a “no case to
                            answer</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Accordingly, in the present case, as the Judge
                    had held that, on the basis of the evidence presented to her by the Appellant,
                    there was no case for the Respondents to answer, no adverse inference should be
                    drawn against the Respondents for deciding not to call any evidence. The
                    Appellant had not satisfied the threshold requirement which would necessitate
                    the Respondents to answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The second preliminary issue is whether the
                    Appellant ought to be granted leave to raise a number of new issues in this
                    appeal. Here we note that the Respondents have strenuously contended that the
                    “Appellant has impermissibly sought to raise new issues on
                        appeal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The new issues are these:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That clause 7 of the Memorandum of
                            Association (“the MA”) of Thio Holdings
                                (“clause 7”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> is consistent
                            with the existence of the Understanding (“the clause 7
                            point”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That the rules of natural justice apply and were
                            not complied with in respect of the 20 November meeting
                            (“the Natural Justice point”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In addition to the procedural safeguards embodied
                            in Malaysia Dairy’s AA, the Appellant had an equitable right to be
                            notified of the 20 November meeting and this right had been
                            infringed (“the Equitable Right point”).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In our view, the clause 7 point is a new
                    argument which is different (especially in substance) from the original argument
                    that there was an Understanding (bearing in mind that the Understanding was
                    indisputably both <em>unspoken and unwritten</em>). The
                    “classic statement of principle” relating to the admission of a
                    new point at the appeal stage was alluded to by this court in <em>Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Buildin &amp; Civil Engineering
                        Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571
                        (“<em>Panwah Steel</em>”) at [15] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The classic statement of principle is, of course, that of Lord Herschell
                        in the House of Lords decision of <em>The Owners of the Ship
                            “Tasmania” and the Owners of the Freight v Smith and
                            others, The Owners of the Ship “City of Corinth” (The
                            “Tasmania”)</em> (1890) 15 App Cas 223, as follows
                        (at 225):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, I think that a point such as this, not taken at the trial, and
                        presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be most
                        jealously scrutinised. The conduct of a cause at the trial is governed by,
                        and the questions asked of the witnesses are directed to, the points then
                        suggested. And it is obvious that no care is exercised in the elucidation of
                        facts not material to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It appears to me that under these circumstances a Court
                            of Appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground
                            there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt,
                            first, that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new
                            contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy
                            had arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation
                            could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an
                            opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness
                            box</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Apart from the above passage from <em>The “Tasmania”</em> which has been cited and
                    applied by our courts on numerous occasions, it would be apposite for us to also
                    allude to <em>North Staffordshire Railway Company v
                        Edge</em> [1920] AC 254 at 263-264, where Lord Birkenhead LC
                    emphasised that any attempt to introduce a new point on appeal ought to be
                    subjected to strict scrutiny and rarely allowed. Lord Birkenhead LC's central
                    concern, which we share, pivoted around the fulcrum of the respective functions
                    of the trial and appellate courts. An indulgent approach in allowing new points
                    to be brought up on appeal would certainly undermine the efficiency and
                    authority of an appellate court which would be deprived of the benefit of the
                    views of the trial court (see further <em>Susilawati v American
                        Express Bank Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737
                        (“<em>Susilawati</em>”)at [48] and
                    [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Unlike the new point raised in <em>Panwah Steel</em> which involved a “pure question of
                    construction” which was an argument “primarily of law” (see
                    [17] of <em>Panwah Steel</em>), the clause 7 point
                    sought to be introduced is closely linked with the question of the
                    Understanding, whether it existed and the precise terms thereof. What the
                    Appellant is seeking to do is to point to clause 7 to support his
                    contention that the Understanding did in fact exist. It seems to us that any
                    suggestion that the MA of Thio Holdings (in particular Clause 7) supported
                    a finding that the Understanding existed should therefore have been canvassed at
                    the trial below, so that the Respondents would be able to explain why the
                    clause does not support the alleged Understanding. In short, the
                    clause 7 issue is not one involving a pure construction of a document or a
                    pure point of law; evidence from the parties would be relevant and necessary to
                    assist the court to better appreciate the purport of clause 7, and its
                    inter-relation with the alleged Understanding, bearing in mind that the alleged
                    Understanding was not in writing and the exact terms of that understanding are
                    far from precise or clear. In the words expressed in <em>The
                        “Tasmania”</em>,this court does not have <b>“</b>before it all the facts bearing upon the new
                    contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy had
                    arisen at the trial”. In the circumstances, it is our view that it is not
                    appropriate for us to consider the clause 7 point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We turn now to the Natural Justice point (for
                    which the Appellant conceded that he will have to seek leave to raise at this
                        appeal<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>), which consists of both a question
                    of law and a question of fact. The question of law is whether the principles of
                    natural justice apply to the present case, bearing in mind that the requirements
                    of natural justice would depend on the factual circumstances of the case. If the
                    question of law is answered in the affirmative (<em>ie</em>, in favour of the Appellant), then the next question (of fact) is
                    whether the Respondents’ behaviour or actions in this particular case
                    (especially in relation to the various AGMs and Board meetings which were
                    conducted with a view to removing the Appellant from his various positions) had
                    the effect of breaching any of the relevant principles of natural justice. Once
                    again, this is a point which, in our view, should have been raised at the trial
                    below. That said, we think that the essential facts relating to the events
                    leading to the dismissal of the Appellant from the offices were already
                    adequately presented before the court and there was hardly any real dispute
                    between the parties on those facts. Ultimately, it is a question of what the law
                    should imply based on those facts. This can be addressed by way of submission.
                    Thus, we do not think that allowing this point to be canvassed at this appeal
                    stage would cause any real prejudice to the Respondents. This is unlike the
                    situation in <em>Susilawati</em> where there was an attempt
                    by the appellant to fashion an entirely new cause of action on
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Next, turning to the Equitable Right point, in
                    his written submissions to this court, the Appellant contended that
                    “[w]here the majority of directors intend to remove a minority director
                    from the board, they have an equitable duty to notify the minority director,
                    even if the minority director is overseas: they cannot act
                        surreptitiously.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Putting it in another way, the
                    Appellant is arguing that over and above his rights under the Malaysia Dairy AA,
                    he has, <em>inter alia</em>, an equitable right to be
                    adequately notified of any board meeting or board resolution proposing to remove
                    him as a director of Malaysia Dairy. Here, when the Board of Malaysia Dairy
                    chose a day, on which it knew the Appellant was out of the country, to hold its
                    meeting, the Board and its members had acted in breach of their fiduciary duties
                    and in disregard of his equitable right.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As we view it, this point essentially raises
                    questions of law. The first question is whether the Appellant has an equitable
                    right to be adequately notified of any Board meeting or Board resolution
                    proposing to remove him from his positions in Malaysia Dairy. The second
                    question is whether, on the facts, even as presented by the Respondents, the
                    Appellant’s right had been infringed by the Respondents. In the
                    circumstances, we think it is in order to allow the issue to be raised at this
                    appeal stage. We would also add that there might be a certain degree of overlap
                    between the second new issue (<em>ie</em>, Natural Justice
                    point) and the third new issue (<em>ie</em>, Equitable
                    Right point). Indeed, both will involve arguments based substantially on
                    considerations of fairness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Whether there were procedural breaches of the AA of Malaysia
                Dairy and Modern Dairy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We have at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above set out the relevant clause of the Malaysia
                    Dairy AA. The Judge held that (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>
                    above), even if there was in the strict sense a non-compliance with Art 88 of
                    the Malaysia Dairy AA, no substantial injustice was caused to the Appellant,
                    relying in this regard on section 392(2). As section 392 is central to
                    this appeal, we shall set it out in full (of which only subsections (1) to (4)

                        has been or is likely to be caused to any person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of s 392(2), it is clear that where there is a
                    “procedural irregularity”, in the proceeding of a company, the
                    proceeding in question will <em>not</em> be invalidated
                    unless substantial injustice (that cannot be remedied by any order of the Court)
                    has been caused. Before we venture forward into a discussion of the relevant
                    case authorities as regards s 392, we should make a few observations at the
                    outset. First, the section was not pleaded by both the Appellant and the
                    Respondents. Secondly, the section was expressly raised and discussed by
                    the Respondents in their opening and closing statements. It would appear that
                    the Appellant, however, did not expressly discuss the (non) applicability of
                    s 392, save for their averment in his opening statement that “[t]he
                    removal of the [Appellant] from his offices in Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy
                    constitutes a substantive breach of the articles of those companies and cannot
                    be regarded as a mere irregularity”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In this regard, we are somewhat surprised
                    that the Appellant did not, at the trial below, raise the further argument that,
                    even if the breach was a mere irregularity, s 392(2) would still not apply
                    because he had been substantially prejudiced by it. In any case, this is
                    clearly, in the context of the present case, a pure point of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Case law from Australia (eg, <em>Re Waldcourt Investment Company Pty Ltd</em>
                    [1988] WAR 1 and <em>Australian Hydrocarbons NL v
                        Green</em> (1985) 10 ACLR 72) would suggest that the onus of
                    satisfying the court that a procedural irregularity has caused or is likely to
                    cause substantial and irremediable injustice rests upon the person challenging
                    the validity of the proceeding (see further <em>Ford: Principles
                        of Corporations Law</em> (Butterworths, 2000) at para 7.581) .
                    But the threshold burden of showing that the irregularity in question is of a
                    procedural nature rests on the party seeking to uphold the proceeding. Unless
                    this threshold requirement is met, s 392(2) can have no
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is trite law that a meeting of the board of
                    directors and an annual general meeting both fall within the meaning of the term
                    “proceeding” in s 392(2) (see <em>Golden
                        Harvest Films Distribution (Pte) Ltd v Golden Village Multiplex Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR 940(“<em>Golden
                        Harvest</em>”) ) and <em>Welch v Britannia
                        Industries Pte Ltd</em> [1993] 1 SLR 673). More
                    specifically, it should also be noted that section 1322(2) of the
                    Australian Corporations Act (“the Australian Act”) (from which our
                    s 392(2) was adapted from) was held to be applicable to proceedings
                    relating to the removal of a director (see Supreme Court of Queensland decision
                    of <em>Re Pembury Pty Ltd</em> [1991] 4 ACSR 759
                        (“<em>Re Pembury</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The next question to consider is whether
                    s 392 could apply if the irregularity was not brought about by inadvertence
                    but by <em>deliberate choice</em>. The authorities on this
                    point are not consistent. The Respondents relied on <em>Re
                        Pembury</em> as support for the proposition that section 1322(2)
                    of the Australian Act (the equivalent of our s 392(2)) is <em>not</em> restricted to instances where the non-compliance is
                    inadvertent or accidental. In this regard, the Respondents pointed out, relying
                    on the judgment of Byrne J in <em>Re Pembury</em> at
                    761, that “[u]nlike section 1322 (3) (which is the equivalent of our
                    s 392(3)) which uses the word “accidental”, section1322(2)
                    (the equivalent of our s 392(2)) is not expressly limited to accidental
                    non-compliance. In the circumstances, the legislative intent is for
                    section 1322(2) to be extended to deliberate non-compliance as
                        well.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span><em>Re Pembury</em> was followed in subsequent cases, eg
                        <em>Greig &amp; Anor as Liquidators of Australian Building
                        Industries Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Australian Building Industries Pty
                        Ltd</em> [2002] QSC 138.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In contrast, in <em>Re P W
                        Saddington &amp; Sons Pty Ltd</em> (1990) 2 ASCR 158
                        (“<em>Saddington</em>”), Young J
                    held that a deliberate choice to convene an invalid meeting was not a
                    “procedural irregularity” within the meaning of the New South
                    Wales equivalent of our s 392(2) . The views of Young J in <em>Saddington</em> were later endorsed by Olsson J in
                        <em>Electro Research International Pty Ltd and Ors v Stec and
                        Anor</em> (1996) 20 ACSR 320 at 351. Interestingly, in the
                    later case of <em>National Australia Bank Ltd v Market Holdings
                        Pty Ltd</em> [2000] NSWSC 1009 (“<em>National Australia Bank</em>”), Young J noted at [24]
                    that there had “not been wholesale acceptance of that decision (<em>ie, Saddington</em>”)” and did not expressly
                    reaffirm <em>Saddington</em>. However, for the purposes of
                    deciding <em>National Australia Bank</em>, Young J did
                    not have to decide the issue or to comment further on <em>Saddington</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Turning to the local decisions, we note that
                        <em>Re Pembury</em> was followed in <em>Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd v Golden Harvest Films Distribution (Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 599 (“<em>Golden Village Multiplex</em>”) where the High Court observed
                    (in <em>obiter</em>) as follows at [44]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the first defendant described the irregularity as a
                        “blatant contravention” of Art 118 of the Articles of
                        Association, it did not contend that s 392 was inapplicable. In any
                        case, in my view, to invoke s 392(2) it is not necessary that the
                        irregularity arose from inadvertence: see <em>Re Pembury Pty
                            Ltd</em> (1991) 9 ACLC 937 in which the court considered
                        the Australian equivalent of our s 392.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The decision of <em>Golden Village Multiplex</em>
                    was upheld by this court on appeal although this court did not expressly in its
                    grounds of decision in <em>Golden Harvest</em> address the
                    point whether in order to invoke s 392(2), the irregularity must be due to
                    inadvertence. It seems to us that, apart from the reason given by Byrne J
                    in <em>Re Pembury</em> arising from a comparison of the
                    literal wording between s 392(2) and s 392(3), to hold s 392(2)
                    to be inapplicable whenever the non-compliance is not due to inadvertence would
                    deprive the provision of much of its efficacy. It must be borne in mind that the
                    nature and object of the requirement, which is the subject of the irregularity,
                    would naturally vary from case to case. Some requirements which are not complied
                    with may be so trivial that the parties have deliberately decided to overlook it
                    and if in such a case the court is compelled to hold the proceeding to be
                    invalid because the non-compliance was not due to inadvertence, that would
                    seriously undermine the utility of the statutory provision. Ultimately it is the
                    significance and the materiality of the non- compliance which should be
                    decisive. This is where the proviso of “substantial injustice” in
                    the provision will come into play. In our view, that is where the focus should
                    be, and not whether the non-compliance was accidental or otherwise. <em>Only if it is shown that the non-compliance has caused substantial
                        injustice or prejudice to an interested party, should the proceeding be held
                        to be invalid by the court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Appellant contended that the
                    irregularities in the present case constituted <em>substantive</em> breaches, as opposed to <em>procedural</em> breaches.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>
                    He argued that the Judge had failed to analyse whether the non-compliance was of
                    a procedural or substantive nature; instead she assumed that the breach was
                    procedural and proceeded on that basis. We note that the argument that the
                    non-compliance was a substantive one was in fact raised and ventilated by the
                    Appellant in his opening statement at the trial below. According to the
                    Appellant, if the irregularity is not merely procedural but substantive, the
                    proceeding is invalid unless the Court is persuaded to make an order under
                    section 392(4) to validate it (see for example <em>Re
                        Goodwealth Trading Pte Ltd</em> [1990] SLR 1239 at 1245). In
                    this connection, the Appellant pointed out that the Respondents had <em>not</em> made any such application pursuant to
                    section 392(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The primary irregularity in connection with
                    the Malaysia Dairy Board meeting was the failure to make a request to the
                    Appellant to vacate office pursuant to Article 88(c) which, to repeat, is
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The office of director shall, <em>ipso facto</em>, be
                        vacated:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) If he shall be <em>requested to vacate
                            office</em> by all the other Directors, they pass a resolution
                        that he has been so requested and by reason thereof has vacated his
                        office.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is not disputed that there are two requirements to be fulfilled
                    before a director can be deemed to have vacated office pursuant to
                    Article 88(c). First, there must be a request for him to vacate office and
                    this request must come from the other directors. Second, there must be a
                    resolution passed stating that the director in question has been so requested
                    and that he is thereby deemed to have vacated office. It is also not disputed
                    that the first step was not complied with in the present case. The question that
                    must be asked is whether this omission or irregularity was procedural or
                    substantive in nature?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Turning to Modern Dairy and the resolution
                    passed at its AGM on 21 November 2007, the Appellant advanced the same
                    argument as above to the effect that the irregularity concerned was a
                    substantive one. The relevant resolution purportedly passed at the deemed AGM of
                    Modem Dairy on 21 November 2007 was in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Mr Thio Keng Poon be requested to vacate,
                        and by reason thereof is deemed to have vacated, the office as a Director,
                        Managing Director and Chairman of the Company with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The resolution appears to have resolved that a request for the
                    Appellant to resign would be addressed to him and that by reason of such a
                    request, he would be deemed to have vacated his office. The irregularity which
                    the Appellant has pointed out, and which he is taking issue on, relates to the
                    fact that there was in fact no written request made by his co-directors to him
                    asking him to resign and that this omission therefore resulted in the resolution
                    becoming wholly invalid..</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Respondents’ Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Respondents strenuously contended that
                    concepts such as good faith and natural justice or due process should <em>not</em> be implied into Article 88(c). In this
                    connection, the Respondent vigorously made the following propositions. First,
                    the Respondent argued that there is nothing express in the language of
                    Article 88(c) which requires the incorporation of the concepts of natural
                    justice or due process in the construction of that article. In any event, the
                    Appellant did not plead that natural justice and or due process are to be
                    implied. Second, Article 88(c) states that the office of director is
                        “<em>ipso facto</em>” vacated when the
                    request is made and the resolution is passed. Speed is therefore of the essence,
                    and it militates against the implication of natural justice or due process,
                    which would entail delay. Third, Article 88(c) confers on the requesting
                    directors a wholly unrestricted power. Their power to remove the requested
                    director is not confined to cases of misconduct. Finally, the Appellant did not
                    even have a right to be given notice (let alone reasonable notice) of the
                    resolution to remove him. In this regard, Article 112 of the Malaysia Dairy
                    AA specifically provides that “It shall not be necessary to give notice
                    of a meeting of the Board to any Director for the time being absent from
                    Singapore and West Malaysia”, and it is undisputed that the Appellant was
                    away from Singapore and West Malaysia at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Much reliance was placed by the Respondent on
                    the case of <em>Gaiman v National Association for Mental
                        Health</em> [1971] 1 Ch 317 (“<em>Gaiman</em>”) which discussed an article similar to
                    Article 88(c). There the article in question
                    (“Article 7B”) provided that a member shall forthwith cease
                    to be such if requested by resolution of the council to resign, but that the
                    member could appeal against that resolution to the association in general
                    meeting. Indeed, Article 7B provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“A member of the association shall forthwith cease to be a member:
                        - … (B) If he is requested by resolution of the council to resign,
                        but so that a member so requested to resign may within seven days after
                        notice of the resolution shall have been given to him by notice in writing
                        to the secretary of the association appeal against such resolution to the
                        association in general meeting…”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Gaiman</em>, a
                    meeting of the council resolved that 302 members known or suspected to be
                    scientologists be requested to resign. Notice of the resolution was served on
                    all the members concerned on the same day as the meeting. Indeed, there were no
                    indications that any procedural breaches (in so far as the express requirements
                    of Article 7B were concerned) had occurred: there was in fact a resolution
                    requesting the members to resign. Thus Article 7B was observed. What the
                    plaintiff in <em>Gaiman</em> complained of was that,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the members affected were not
                    accorded a hearing, and therefore, principles of natural justice were not
                    complied with. In this regard, Megarry J rejected that proposition, holding
                    at p 336 that the Court would not imply a term that natural justice or due
                    process was to be observed “in the teeth of sufficient indications that
                    the principles of natural justice are not to apply”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Procedural or substantive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For the purposes of this appeal, the critical
                    question, in relation to s 392(2), is whether the irregularity, <em>ie</em>, the failure to give a notice to the Appellant asking
                    him to resign, is procedural or substantive in nature. Unless we rule that the
                    irregularity is a procedural one, then s 392(2) can have no application and
                    this would mean that the purported removal of the Appellant from the various
                    positions he held in Malaysia Dairy will be of no effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We would be stating the obvious if we say that
                    the question of whether a particular irregularity is procedural or substantive
                    can often be a strikingly difficult issue to determine: see <em>Cordiant Communications (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Communications Group
                        Holdings Ltd</em> [2005] NSWSC 1005 (“<em>Cordiant</em>”). Palmer J in <em>Cordiant</em> enunciated the following principles in addressing that
                    question (at [102] to [104]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What, then, is the substantive irregularity as distinct from
                        a procedural irregularity? In my view, the cases concerning the distinction
                        between a substantive law or rule and a procedural law or rule provide some
                        guidance. In <em>John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson</em>
                        (2000) 203 CLR 503, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and
                        Hayne JJ said (at 543-544):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">matters that affect the existence, extent or enforceability of the
                            rights or duties of the parties to an action are maters that, on their
                            face, appear to be concerned with issues of substance, not with issues
                            of procedure. Or to adopt the formulation put forward by Mason CJ
                            in McKain “rules which are directed to governing or regulating
                            the mode or conduct of court proceedings” are procedural and all
                            other provisions or rules are to be classified as substantive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of this observation and of the decisions in
                            <em>Industrial Equity, ANZ Nominees, Scullion</em>
                        and <em>Link Agricultural</em>, I think that the
                        following general proposition may be formulated for the purposes of the
                        application of the Corporations Act, s 1322:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">- what is a “procedural irregularity” will be
                            ascertained by first determining what is “the thing to be
                            done” which the procedure is to regulate;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">- if there is an irregularity which changes the substance of
                            “the thing to be done”, the irregularity will be
                            substantive;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">- if the irregularity merely departs from the prescribed manner in
                            which the thing is to be done without changing the substance of the
                            thing, the irregularity is procedural.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application of such a proposition in any particular case will depend
                        upon the starting point, <em>ie</em>, defining
                        “the thing to be done”. Different answers to the question will
                        be found depending on how broadly or narrowly one defines “the thing
                        to be done”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In <em>Wagner v International
                        Health Promotions</em> 15 ACSR 419, as in the present case,
                    two requirements had to be fulfilled before an administrator to the company
                    could validly be appointed: first, the directors had to resolve that the company
                    was or was likely to become unable to pay its debts; secondly, the directors had
                    to resolve upon the appointment of a particular individual as administrator.
                    Although the insolvency of the company was discussed at the board meeting that
                    was held, there was no formal resolution on that aspect. The directors simply
                    voted upon the appointment of an administrator. This was held to be a
                    substantive as opposed to a procedural irregularity which could not be cured by
                    the Australian equivalent of section 392(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Such an irregularity may be contrasted to that
                    in <em>Re Caysand No 64 Pty Ltd</em> (1993)
                    11 ACLR 1197, relied upon by the Respondents, where the court
                    considered that a failure to comply with a statutory time limit was a procedural
                    irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It appears to us that to determine whether a
                    non-compliance is of a procedural or substantive nature, one must assiduously
                    examine the aim or object of the requirement which was not complied with. The
                    failure to serve upon the Appellant a notice to resign, as required by
                    Article 88(c), is certainly not of the same genre as those irregularities
                    listed in s 392(1). As we see it, the requirement of such a notice would
                    serve two complementary purposes. First, it gives notice to the director in
                    question that his services on the Board are no longer appreciated by his
                    co-directors. He will then have to consider his available options. He may well
                    decide to leave voluntarily and resign, thus preserving his dignity. Second, and
                    in the alternative, he may wish to bring it up and appeal to his co-directors
                    and convince them that his remaining on the Board would be in the best interests
                    of the company. The failure to serve the Appellant with such a notice would deny
                    him these choices. This, to our minds, can hardly be considered to be a matter
                    of procedure. It is also apparent to us that the giving of choices to the
                    director in question, must have been the obvious intention behind the provision;
                    otherwise the provision could have simply provided that a director shall cease
                    to be a director upon a resolution being passed by the Board or upon the request
                    to resign being made to him by his co-directors and nothing else (see the Hong
                    Kong decision of <em>Samuel Tak Lee v Chou Wen Hsien</em>
                    [1984] 1 WLR 1202 (“<em>Samuel
                    Lee</em>”)at [71]). Here, we are reminded of the Malaysian Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>Aik Ming (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v Chang
                        Ching Chuen &amp; Ors</em> [1995] 2 MLJ 770, where Justice
                    Gopal Sri Ram pertinently asked (at 804), in relation to a <em>pari materia</em> Malaysian provision, “How can it ever be
                    said that a Director’s removal at a meeting of which notice to him is
                    withheld is a mere irregularity?”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The factual matrix of the present case is
                    quite different from that of <em>Gaiman</em>. In <em>Gaiman</em>, notice was in fact given to the members
                    concerned requesting them to resign. Moreover, the rules there provided for an
                    appeal process to the affected members. In the case at hand, it is not disputed
                    that the procedural requirement of Article 88(c) itself (as regards the
                    requirement for the Appellant to be formally requested to step down) was
                    breached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     At this juncture, we will refer to the case of
                        <em>Samuel Lee</em>, a decision from Hong Kong which
                    went all the way to the Privy Council and on which the Respondents relied.
                    There, the relevant provision (Article 73(d)) read “The office of [a
                    director] shall be vacated: …. (d) if he is requested in writing by all
                    his co-directors to resign.” The plaintiff, a shareholder and director of
                    the company in question, was embroiled in some dispute with his co-directors
                    over the accounts. He asked for a Board meeting whereupon his co-directors gave
                    him notice, pursuant to Article 73(d), requesting his immediate
                    resignation. The plaintiff instituted proceedings and pleaded bad faith on the
                    part of the directors and sought, <em>inter alia</em>, for
                    a declaration that the notice requesting his resignation was invalid.
                    Essentially, the Privy Council held that, in the interest of business efficacy
                    (at 1207), “it is necessary to construe the articles strictly in
                    accordance with its terms without any qualification”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Quite clearly, <em>Samuel
                        Lee</em> can be distinguished from the present case in two respects.
                    First, the terms of Article 73(d) are different from those of
                    Article 88(c) of our case here. Under Article 73(d), upon service of
                    the notice to resign, the director in question would <em>automatically</em> lose his directorship. No further actions were
                    required to be taken by the board of directors. But under Article 88(c) of
                    our case, the Board of Directors must pass a resolution to <em>confirm</em> the decision requiring the Appellant to leave the Board.
                    Second, unlike the position in <em>Samuel Lee</em>, the
                    Appellant’s co-directors did not serve on him the notice to resign as
                    required under Article 88(c). The Privy Council in <em>Samuel Lee</em> remarked that such a provision should be construed
                    according to its terms. Taking that approach and as the Respondents have not
                    complied with the terms of Article 88(c) by serving on the Appellant a
                    notice to resign, the subsequent resolution by the Board of Directors to deem
                    him as having vacated his positions could not have any effect because the
                    pre-condition has not been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the
                    non-compliance in question was <em>not</em> of a procedural
                    nature and, therefore, s 392(2) cannot apply to validate the resolution of
                    the Board of Malaysia Dairy taken on 20 November 2007 to remove the
                    Appellant from the offices he held in the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Substantial injustice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We now turn to consider the alternative
                    argument of the Appellant that the resolution of the Board of Malaysia Dairy was
                    invalid because the irregularity (<em>ie</em>,
                    non-compliance with the issue of a notice to the Appellant to resign) had caused
                    substantial injustice or prejudice to him. In view of our decision that the
                    irregularity was not of a procedural nature, s 392(2) cannot apply and
                    there is therefore no real necessity for us to consider this alternative
                    argument. However, for very much the same reasons which we have alluded to above
                    (at <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a>), we think it must also follow that
                    the non-compliance has caused substantial injustice to the
                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The meaning of substantial injustice has been
                    discussed by the courts in various jurisdictions on numerous occasions, and in
                    this regard, the following principles can be distilled. First, it is axiomatic
                    that there must be a direct link between the procedural irregularity in question
                    and the injustice suffered (see <em>Golden Harvest</em> at
                    955-956, <em>Mamouney v Soliman and Others</em> (1992)
                    9 ASCR 63 at 71 (“<em>Mamouney</em>”)). Secondly, the injustice must be of a
                    “substantial” nature. In essence, what this means is that the
                    injustice must be real, rather than theoretical or fanciful (see <em>Bell Resources Ltd v Turnbridge Pty Ltd &amp; Others
                        (No 2)</em> (1988) 13 ACLR 762 at 766). There must,
                    therefore, be some basis or indication on the face of the evidence before the
                    court that the aggrieved party had suffered injustice or would suffer injustice
                    as a result of the procedural irregularity occurring. Thirdly, the aggrieved
                    party must show that there <em>may</em> or could have been
                    a different result, if not for the occurrence of the procedural irregularity
                    (see <em>Mamouney</em> at 71 where Hodgson J made a
                    general reference to the cases of <em>Re Pembury</em> and
                        <em>Poliwka v Heven Holdings Pty Ltd</em> (1992)
                    7 ACSR 85). This is a fundamentally important point. In this regard,
                    the aggrieved party does <em>not</em> need to show that
                    there would certainly have been a different result if not for the irregularity.
                    All he has to show is that there <em>may</em> or <em>could</em> have been a different result. This possibility,
                    however, should not be a theoretical or fanciful one. One must bear in mind the
                    importance of operating in the realm of reality. Here, we observe that the
                    evidence before us raised a distinct possibility that the Appellant may not have
                    been removed as a director had he been able to present his case to all the
                    directors of Malaysia Dairy (see below at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>), but we will not venture further than this. As we have
                    emphasised below at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>, it is certainly
                    not for this court to speculate on what the actual outcome of the Board meeting
                    of Malaysia Diary would have been had the proper process been followed. This, in
                    essence, was the substantial injustice or prejudice that the Appellant has
                    suffered as a direct result of the procedural irregularity
                occurring.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In a sense, it is apposite to note that the
                    substantial injustice proviso in s 392(2) reflects the common law position.
                    In this regard, it may be useful to refer to the following observations made by
                    Lord Wilberforce in <em>Malloch v Aberdeen Corp</em> [1971]
                    1 WLR 1578 (“<em>Malloch</em>”), at
                    1595:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A breach of procedure, whether called a failure of natural justice, or an
                        essential administrative fault, cannot give him a remedy in the courts,
                        unless behind it there is something of substance which has been lost by the
                        failure. The court does not act in vain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same vein, Lord Wilberforce also remarked as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant has first to show that his position was such that he had, in
                        principle, a right to make representations before a decision against him was
                        taken. But to show this is not necessarily enough, unless he can also show
                        that if admitted to state his case he had a case of substance to make. A
                        breach of procedure whether called a failure of natural justice, or an
                        essential administrative fault, cannot give him a remedy in the courts,
                        unless behind it there is something of substance which has been lost by the
                        failure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the principles enunciated aforesaid by Lord Wilberforce are not
                    in doubt, the decision in <em>Malloch</em>, where the court
                    refused relief, rested on special facts. There, a teacher was dismissed without
                    being heard. There, new regulations made by the Secretary of State, which had
                    the force of law, required all certified teachers to be registered. The
                    regulations also required all education authorities to dismiss from employment
                    all certified teachers who did not register. The plaintiff was one of a number
                    of certified teachers who objected to applying for registration. The education
                    authority had no choice but to dismiss him. In any event, even if the authority
                    had formally complied with the rules of natural justice, the result would still
                    have been the same as the education authority would have had no option in the
                    matter. Thus, the views of Lord Wilberforce quoted above should be viewed in
                    that light. The court was not saying that it was not necessary to accord the
                    plaintiff a right to be heard but that on account of the new regulations it
                    would not have served any purpose whatsoever. That was why Lord Wilberforce
                    observed that “the court does not act in vain”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the present case, by not giving the notice
                    to resign to the Appellant, the latter was denied his opportunity to exercise
                    his choice, and if he should decide to stay and present his case before the full
                    Board (and here we would add that his subsequent conduct, particularly the
                    institution of Suit 734 and Suit 10 clearly demonstrated such
                    intention), he had indeed been seriously prejudiced. The Judge said at [82] that
                    “there was nothing to stop the [Respondents] from removing the
                    [Appellant] from his positions in [Malaysia Dairy] and Modern Dairy by complying
                    with the requisite procedural requirements even if he was reinstated”.
                    But we would hasten to caution that it is not for this court, or any court, to
                    speculate whether, if he had made his case to the full Board, he would or would
                    not be allowed to retain the offices which he had been stripped off. This would
                    not necessarily be a foregone conclusion, unlike the position in <em>Malloch</em> (see <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>
                    above). All we need observe is that there is evidence to suggest that not all
                    his daughters (who are also directors) were hostile towards him. Furthermore,
                    the fact that Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy are family owned and operated
                    companies was not lost on us. The fact that Png and Wee had to wait until the
                    Appellant was away from Singapore for a medical reason before they made their
                    move to strip him of his offices summarily speaks volumes. In the premises, it
                    is our view that the non-compliance with Article 88(c) in this case has
                    caused him substantial injustice or prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Turning to Modern Dairy and the resolution
                    passed at the AGM on 21 November 2007 (see above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>), the Appellant accepted that
                    Article 82(g) of Modern Dairy was <em>not</em> part of
                    the Modern Dairy AA at the time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> However, he contended that the
                    resolution itself (see above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>) was
                    defective in nature because there was in fact <em>no</em>
                    request made to the Appellant to step down as a director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The exact wording of Resolution
                    6 stated unambiguously that the Appellant had been “requested to vacate,
                    and by reason thereof is deemed to have vacated, the office as a Director,
                    Managing Director and Chairman of the Company with immediate
                        effect.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> On the facts and evidence, it is indubitable
                    that no such request was issued to the Appellant. The entire premise upon which
                    the resolution was based was therefore patently wrong. Accordingly, we agree
                    with the Appellant that the purported removal of him from the offices he held in
                    Modern Dairy is of no effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Furthermore (and this is a point, which
                    although not specifically raised by the Appellant, is entirely in line with his
                    complaint of not being treated fairly or in accordance with the rules of natural
                    justice), we are of the view that the Appellant should have been informed that
                    it was proposed at the AGM of 21 November 2007 to remove him as a director
                    before the expiry of his term. This is wholly consistent with fundamental
                    principles of justice and fairness. He had legitimate expectations to serve out
                    his term. If it was proposed to remove him before his term expired, he should
                    have been informed of the proposal so that he would have the option of
                    voluntarily resigning rather than suffering the odium or indignity of being
                    removed. Here, surreptitiously, and with no notice given to the Appellant, he
                    was summarily removed as Director, Managing Director and Chairman of Modern
                    Dairy by a resolution adopted at the AGM on 21 November 2007 (where Pyn was
                    the appointed representative of Malaysia Dairy at Modern Dairy’s
                        AGM)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>.
                    We recognise that as the Appellant is not a shareholder of Modern Dairy, he
                    would have no <em>locus standi</em> (not being a member) to
                    argue that he should have been served 14 days notice pursuant to Article 55
                    of Modern Dairy. But this should certainly not in any way dilute the
                    Appellant’s <em>equitable</em> right to be given
                    timely notice of a proposal to remove him as a director (see <em>Chan Choon Ming v Low Poh Choon</em> (1994) CSLR VI [254]
                    followed by GP Selvam J in <em>Polybuilding (S) Pte Ltd v
                        Lim Heng Lee &amp; Ors</em> [2001] 3 SLR 184 at [11]) so
                    that he would be in a position to decide his options. In light of this, we
                    therefore find the submission by the Respondents, that notice of an intended
                    resolution to remove the Appellant as a director need not be given to him,
                    astonishing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether the Appellant ought to have succeeded in his claim
                for minority oppression pursuant to s 216 of the Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Section 216 of the Companies Act reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Personal remedies in cases of oppression or injustice</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">216. —(1) Any member or holder of a debenture of a company or, in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    that the affairs

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     A central plank in the Appellant’s
                    argument here is that the Understanding existed and operated to regulate the
                    business affairs of the Thio Group (the Appellant has since abandoned his
                    contention that the Assurance existed). The Appellant’s complaint is that
                    the rest of the Thio family (his sons, daughters and wife) wilfully disregarded
                    the Understanding by attempting to remove him from the various executive
                    positions which he held in the Thio Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Appellant alleged that
                    the majority of directors in Malaysia Dairy had abused their voting powers by
                    voting without good faith and for ulterior reasons and not for the good of the
                    company. In this regard, the Appellant argued that the wrong which he suffered
                    ought to be remedied under s 216 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Appellant conceded that he never
                    “[spoke] or [discussed] the Understanding with his
                        children”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> He, however, insisted that an express
                    agreement is <em>not</em> required to give effect to the
                        Understanding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, the Appellant pointed to
                    a lengthy list of the various “practices and conventions” and the
                    manner he conducted the affairs of the Thio group in support of his contention
                    that the Understanding in fact existed. After a careful examination of the
                    evidence the Judge held that the Appellant had failed to prove, on a balance of
                    probabilities, that there was such an Understanding. There is hardly any basis
                    for us to disagree with such a finding of fact by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     That, however, is not the end of the matter.
                    The Appellant argued that, as a member, he has legitimate expectations which are
                        enforceable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Such legitimate expectations may
                    emanate from outside the Corporate Constitution comprising of the MA and the AA.
                    The Appellant cited the House of Lords decision of <em>Ebruhimi v
                        Westbourne Galleries Limited</em> [1973] AC 360
                        (“<em>Ebruhimi</em>”) in support of his
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Appellant was quick to point out that the
                    Thio Group was akin to a family company set up by a patriarch and resembled that
                    of a partnership built on mutual trust and confidence. In such an instance, the
                    Appellant submitted that the court will look beyond the MA and the AA when
                    determining the rights that the members of the companies are entitled to. In
                    support, he cited this court’s decision in <em>Chow Kwok
                        Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi &amp; Ors</em> [2008] 4 SLR 362
                        (“<em>Chow Kwok
                Chuen</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We have absolutely no quarrel with the
                    principle which the Appellant quoted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> from <em>Chow
                        Kwok Chuen</em> at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] person who joins a company should accept and work
                            within the framework set out in its memorandum and articles of
                            association. The reason an incorporated partnership is treated somewhat
                            differently is because of the express or implicit understanding among
                            the partners    before incorporation as to how the new company
                            is to be run or managed and equity will not allow a person who is a
                            party to that understanding to renege on that understanding. Compare
                            that situation with that of a company formed by a patriarch for the
                            family: it would be clearly the expectation of the patriarch that the
                            children would co-operate, work the company and make it grow for the
                            common good of themselves and their descendants. When a child receives
                            shares in such a company from the patriarch, either during the
                            latter’s lifetime or under his will, the child is not really
                            entering into the company of his or her own free will. So the rationale
                            alluded to at [19] above does not apply to such a scenario. Quite
                            naturally he or she should aim to work harmoniously with his or her
                            siblings in managing the company and in fulfilling the hopes of the
                            patriarch, and in turn to prosper the company. Co-operation and mutual
                            trust among sibling shareholders or directors are central to such a
                            family company and their absence is as critical as in a
                            quasi-partnership…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having said that, it seems to us clear that caution must be
                    exercised before one applies the principles enunciated in <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> and <em>Ebruhimi</em>. Both
                    those cases were concerned with an application to wind up a company under the
                    “just and equitable ground”, a subject matter which stands in
                    stark contrast from the present case where the Appellant is seeking not to wind
                    up any of the companies,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> but an order that he be reinstated as Director,
                    Managing Director and Chairman of Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     We do not see any merit in the
                    Appellant’s arguments that he had “legitimate expectations arising
                    from the terms of the Understanding”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. On the evidence before the
                    court, the Understanding was simply not proved to have existed. If the
                    Understanding was proved on a balance of probabilities to have existed, then
                    there would have been a basis for the Appellant to argue that he had legitimate
                    expectations arising out of it. Indeed, the main plank in the Appellant’s
                    case was that “[i]n breach of the Appellant’s legitimate
                    expectations <em>arising from the Understanding</em>, the
                    Respondents had conducted the affairs of both Malaysia Dairy and Modern Dairy in
                    a manner oppressive to the Appellant [emphasis added]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Unfortunately for the Appellant,
                    his failure to prove the existence of the Understanding must necessarily mean
                    that his s 216 claim would also fail. Indeed, the Appellant accepted under
                    cross-examination that if the Understanding did not exist, “the rest of
                    [his] family members can get together at any time and remove
                        [him]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Moreover, we would reiterate that even if the
                    Appellant had proven the existence of the Understanding, he cannot rely on it to
                    obtain his reinstatement as Chairman, Managing Director and Director of Malaysia
                    Dairy for two reasons. First, clause 15 of the Deed of Settlement provides
                    that it is the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior
                    agreements or understandings between them. Therefore, the Understanding cannot
                    stand in the face of clause 15. Second, as clause 13 of the Deed of
                    Settlement (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) provides that the
                    companies within the group are to be “managed and operated for profit and
                    in accordance with best corporate practices to return to shareholders maximum
                    returns” the Understanding must be applied consistently, and in harmony
                    with clause 13. Any legitimate expectation that the Appellant harboured
                    pursuant to the Understanding must be subject to clause 13. In the result,
                    the Appellant’s claim based on oppression must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Civil Appeal No. 71 of 2009/Q</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Having dealt with the main appeal, it only
                    remains for us to address briefly the Appellant’s appeal against an Order
                    of Court made by the Judge, disallowing the amendments proposed by the Appellant
                    in relation to the 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph of the draft
                    Judgment which related to the Counterclaim put forward by the Respondents in
                    Suit 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">IT IS FURTHER ADJUDGED that in respect of [Malaysia Dairy’s]
                        Counterclaim in [Suit 10] there be interlocutory judgment for [Malaysia
                        Dairy] against the [Appellant] for an inquiry to be taken for all sums
                        claimed by [Malaysia Dairy] from the [Appellant] in breach of the
                        [Appellant’s] fiduciary duties with the costs of the inquiry to be
                        reserved to the Registrar having conduct of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant contended that the above portion of the judgment should
                    be amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">IT IS FURTHER ADJUDGED that in respect of [Malaysia Dairy’s]
                        Counterclaim in [Suit 10] there be interlocutory judgment for [Malaysia
                        Dairy] against the [Appellant] for an inquiry to be taken for <b>the sum of S$45,529.64 and/or all sums</b> claimed by
                        [Malaysia Dairy] from the [Appellant] <b>for the period of
                            1 January 2005 to 30 September 2007</b> in breach of
                        the [Appellant’s] fiduciary duties with the costs of the inquiry to be
                        reserved to the Registrar having conduct of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Suggested amendments by the Appellant in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In our view, the Appellant’s appeal
                    against the decision of the Judge <em>not</em> to limit the
                    scope of the inquiry to the sum of $45,529.64 and to the period stated in the
                    E&amp;Y report should be dismissed for two reasons. First, the Appellant’s
                    proposed amendment to include the above limitation is not consistent with the
                    Respondent’s counterclaim where no such restriction is stated. Secondly,
                    the Judge’s reasoning for not including the above limitation was practical
                    and reasonable. Indeed, in the event that it is discovered that the Appellant
                    had made double claims on occasions outside the period covered by the E&amp;Y
                    report, the Respondents would need to initiate a fresh action if the scope of
                    the inquiry was restricted in the manner suggested by the Appellant. This would
                    only serve to incur further costs and cause a waste of time, which will
                    certainly not benefit any party. We would, in this connection, only add one
                    caveat. The sum which the inquiry will determine to be due from the Appellant to
                    Malaysia Dairy would, of course, be subject to the law on
                limitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In the result, we would declare that the
                    purported removal of the Appellant from the various offices he held in Malaysia
                    Dairy and Modern Dairy is of no effect, and accordingly, his appeal as regards
                    Suit 734 is allowed. However, his appeal as regards Suit 10 for
                    oppression is dismissed. As to the question of costs for the action below and
                    these appeals, we would like to hear the parties on it and they are requested to
                    make their submission to us within ten days hereof.</p>
