<p xmlns="">have substituted her judgment for the professional judgement of a medical doctor. The case

cited is totally irrelevant to the case at hand. An alert man has a lot more poise than an

alert man who is in a terrible amount of pain. There is no need for long-term empirical

research to arrive at such a conclusion (see  10 -11).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4)        As regards the

doctor’s opinion that the injury suffered by the victim could also have been caused

by a fall backwards, the trial judge rightly pointed out that the appellant stated that

Thomas (who was alleged by the appellant to have been there) was behind Nicholas when the

appellant caused Nicholas to fall. If this is so, then Thomas would have broken

Nicholas’s fall, and the chance of a serious cut on top of his head would be

extremely unlikely (see  12).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5)        The arrangement of bricks

at the time Nicholas fell, the appellant argues, was one single row along the wall, of one

brick height. Naturally, this arrangement is more conducive to his story that Nicholas

fell backwards and cut the top of his head on the row of bricks. He contends this despite

a) the fact that the police took the photos at 4.45am the same morning and b) that the

police arrived on the scene almost immediately. In short, if the bricks were re-arranged

as the appellant contends, they would have to have been re-arranged right under the noses

of the police officers. This, of course, is unlikely. Even if we allow the

appellant’s argument, how can the appellant explain the second lot of injuries on

Nicholas’s face – ie the fracture of the facial structure/orbit on the right?

(see  12-13).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(6)        There is nothing so

incredible about Nicholas’s explanation for the absence of injuries on his hands. The

absence of injuries to the victim’s hands does not prompt the conclusion that he must

have been the assailant himself (see  14).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(7)        The district judge was

aware that Lim and Nicholas had been drinking prior to the events at the appellant’s

home. However, the doctor who examined Nicholas at hospital testified that the victim did

not show signs of disorientation (see  15).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(8)        It is the

appellant’s case that it is due to his elite training that he was able to fend off

four men without a scratch. But if the commando was not deferent to fear why did he switch

off his lights in order to lead the supposed gang to the belief that he was not in? And if

he wanted to lead them to believe that he was not in, why didn’t he shut and lock the

metal grill and door? Instead he left the door and the grill unlocked. There was no gang

which came to attack the appellant (see  16).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(9)        There was no blood to be

found in the house. This might tally with the appellant’s claim that Nicholas fell

backwards hitting his head on its vertex. This theory is rejected. The two pools <i>outside

</i>the house and there being no blood trails in the house can be explained by the trial

judge’s description of what could very actually have taken place. Nicholas only

testified that he fell unconscious in the appellant’s house. Thus, it could be that

he was continually beaten even outside the flat, but not to his knowledge (see 17).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(10)        The total number of

weapons is not important. The two poles could have been the weapons which rendered the

injury to Nicholas. But they need not have been – this is so because of the nature of

the unlawful assembly offence and how it aims to attribute culpability through the medium

of (potentially) just one act (see  18).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(11)        All other members,

though using weapons which did not administer the fateful blow, are vicariously liable

through that one relevant action. Following this philosophy, there need not be presented

and accounted at trial the full compliment of weapons, and there need not be present the

one key weapon which dealt the fateful blow. It is not imperative that the prosecution

produce the actual weapons used in an assault. It could very well have been the case that

more poles than these two were used (see  18-19).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(12)        It is noteworthy that

Nicholas stated on the stand that if need be he would fight with the appellant at his

home. The Court does not approve of Nicholas’s desire to resolve issues through the

fist as a last resort, but the bottom line is this – he was not even given a chance

to speak with the appellant (see  25).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(13)        The sentence delivered

by the trial judge was in line with the <i>Practitioner’s Library, ‘Sentencing

Practice in the Subordinate Courts’, 2000</i> (see  23).</p>

By virtue of s 149, Cap 224, and s 326 of the Penal Code, the appellant was sentenced by

District Judge Lee Poh Choo to 4 years and 6 strokes of the cane for participating as a

member of an unlawful assembly whose common intention was to cause grievous hurt to one

Perez Nicholas. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeal.

I now give my reasons.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2      The three main

characters in this case – the appellant, the victim, and the fifth prosecution

witness, Lim Ong Kim (Lim) – all knew each other. On the night of 28 November 2001,

the victim (Nicholas), Lim, and a few others were drinking at a coffee shop at Block 412

Bedok North Street 3 when four persons came to the coffee shop. One of them pointed to the

accused and challenged him to a one on one fight. The appellant (Shamsul) was reluctant to

take up the offer of a fight, but nonetheless went out of the coffee shop where a quarrel

began. This soon developed into a fight. The appellant called for Nicholas and Lim to help

him, but the latter two did not get involved. According to Lim, the fight was an

‘inside matter’ and since neither Lim nor Nicholas had anything to do with the

reason behind the brawl, they left after finishing their drinks. Lim and Nicholas departed

whilst the brawl was still in progress. As a consequence, the appellant suffered the worse

for it, and was resentful of the fact that the two did not aid him in his hour of need.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3

        On the evening of 4 December 2001, Lim and

Nicholas went to Bedok Interchange to have a few drinks. At about 1 am the appellant rang

Lim on his hand phone and asked to speak with Nicholas. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4

        The conversation over the phone consisted of a

heated quarrel which stemmed from the appellant’s dissatisfaction that Nicholas did

not help him when he (the appellant) was trying to fend off an attack on 28 November 2001.

Both Lim and Nicholas went to the appellant’s place by taxi. Lim waited downstairs

since he did not have anything to do with this matter between Nicholas and the appellant.

Nicholas made his way up the staircase, and when he reached the appellant’s unit on

the third floor, he found the door wide open. The metal gate was closed but the wooden

door was open. He saw the appellant in the kitchen and decided to open the metal gate to

enter the flat. This he did. When motioning through the living room on the way to the

kitchen, four males pounced on him, and very quickly began to hit him. Nicholas was sure

he was being beaten with poles. At least two of the four men carried poles. He knew this

because these two men were directly in front of him. Nicholas did not see these four men

when he entered the unit, and expressed that they must have been waiting for him in the

two rooms next to the living room.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5

        Thus, an ambush was carried out on Nicholas by

four men. The appellant was stationed in the kitchen. Including the appellant, there were

five in total. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6

        In the scuffle, Nicholas tried to protect his

head from the blows by raising his hands in front of his head in a defensive fashion. He

was continually beaten by poles until he felt a heavy whack on his head. This was the last

thing he remembered of the scuffle. His next conscious moment was in hospital. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7

        The victim suffered ‘fracture of the

facial bones and fracture on the skull following the sagital suture’. The victim also

suffered ‘a deep 5cm laceration on the vertex of his head with bone seen underlying

the wound.’ The victim was warded in hospital for 11 days. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The decision below and the appeal </font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8

        The appellant contends that the District Judge

overlooked or misconstrued a total of eight matters in coming to her findings. It is apt

here to re-visit the principles governing this Court in the sphere of appellate

intervention. In the case of <i>Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47088&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 656</a> this Court

ruled: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is trite law that an appellate court

  should be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact, especially where they

  hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witness,

  unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This principle has been articulated in <i>Lim

Ah Poh v PP</i> [1992] 1SLR 713 at 719, <i>Teo Keng Pong v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10374&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 3 SLR 329</a> at 342,

<i>Ng Soo Hin v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7875&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 105</a>, <i>Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11130&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 464</a>. The standard required of the District Judge’s scrutiny of the evidence and

the witnesses before him is an extremely demanding one, as emphasised by this Court in the

case of <i>Kwan Peng Hong v Public Prosecutor</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59554&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 4 SLR 96</a>. Without such a strict

test at the trial stage, it would be a nonsense to have a principle such as that expressed

in <i>Yap Giau Beng Terrance</i>. Quite to the contrary, the two cases have a similar aim

– a strict standard at the trial stage, which once met, should signal the appellate

court not to intervene unless, of course, something is seen to be plainly wrong. It is

precisely because the trial judge is under such a strict standard that once it is reached,

the appellate court tends not to interfere. One of the reasons for the inclination not to

interfere is the fact that the appellate court does not have the advantage of observing

the demeanour and behaviour of the witnesses. The appellant refers to the case of <i>Kwan

Peng Hong</i>. They are correct to. But the trial judge has matched the standard required,

as laid down in that case by this Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9

        I turn to the matters which the appellant

contends were misconstrued or overlooked by the trial judge. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10

        The first matter involves the doctor’s

testimony and medical report. When Nicholas arrived at hospital he was in pain. He told

the doctor he had been assaulted by <i>three</i> men. This is reflected in the

doctor’s report, which was recorded at 3am on 15 December 2001. The report also

stated that the victim was alert, conscious and responsive, and the doctor knew this

because a) he examined the appellant and b) the appellant’s Glasgow Coma Scale was

15/15. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses the conscious level of a patient and 15/15 meant

that the appellant was responsive. In court, Nicholas stated that he saw <i>four</i> males

rush to him in the appellant’s home. It seems from the material that the appellant is

trying to contend that there is a discrepancy between what Nicholas said to the doctor

upon arrival at the hospital and what he said in Court with regard to the number of people

he was assaulted by. The appellant’s hope, it seems, is that this discrepancy might

damage Nicholas’s credibility as a witness. To this end, the appellant contends that

the trial judge was incorrect not to rely on Nicholas’s initial utterance to the

doctor that there were <i>three</i> men. The appellant used the case of <i>Dr James Khoo

and Others v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy</i> [2001] to argue that the trial judge should not

have substituted her judgment for the professional judgement of a medical doctor who had

stated during cross examination :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">He (Nicholas) was in pain, he (Nicholas)

  was able to answer my questions.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">By using this case, the appellant hopes to

show that <i>three</i> was the correct number and this therefore a) discredits Nicholas as

a witness and b) questions whether there were sufficient persons for an unlawful assembly

charge ( five are needed in total). Firstly, the case cited is totally irrelevant to the

case at hand. To quote from the judgement of the Court of Appeal :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A judge, unschooled and unskilled in the

  art of medicine, has no business adjudicating matters over which medical experts

  themselves cannot come to agreement. This is especially where, as in this case, the

  medical dispute is complex and resolvable only by long-term research and empirical

  observation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The trial judge was without a doubt in her

league when she ruled that Nicholas (who whilst alert and responsive, was also in a

terrible amount of pain) would be in a better position to give a more accurate description

of what happened after he had been treated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11

        An alert man has a lot more poise than an alert

man who is in a terrible amount of pain. There is no need for long-term empirical research

to arrive at such a conclusion. The <i>Dr James Khoo</i> case is irrelevant. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12

        The second matter involves the doctor’s

opinion that the injury suffered by Nicholas could also have been caused by a fall

backwards. The trial judge did not overlook this point. The doctor when cross-examined did

say that Nicholas could have sustained an injury at the top of his head by falling

backwards. But the trial judge decided that though the possibility existed, this was not

what happened. The trial judge rightly pointed out that the appellant stated that Thomas

(who was alleged by the appellant to have been there) was behind Nicholas when the

appellant caused Nicholas to fall. If this is so, then Thomas would have broken

Nicholas’s fall, and the chance of a serious cut on top of his head would be slim.

Then there is the appellant’s contention that the bricks were arranged differently as

what was reflected in the photos. The arrangement of bricks at the time Nicholas fell, the

appellant argues, was one single row along the wall, of one brick height. Naturally, this

arrangement is more conducive to his story that Nicholas fell backwards and cut the top of

his head on the row of bricks. He contends this despite a) the fact that the police took

the photos at 4.45am the same morning and b) that the police arrived on the scene almost

immediately. In short, if the bricks were re-arranged as the appellant contends, they

would have to have been re-arranged right under the noses of the police officers. This, of

course, is unlikely. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13

        Even if we allow the appellant’s argument

a) that he did not actually see Nicholas fall backward, head first, into the bricks, and

b) that this head-hitting-brick argument was just speculation, and c) that what actually

happened was that he fell backwards onto the ground, how can the appellant explain the

second lot of injuries on Nicholas’s face – ie the fracture of the facial

structure/orbit on the right? I maintain that the trial judge did not err in her finding

that Nicholas was injured by men wielding poles. The doctor’s report did conclude

that the injuries sustained were consistent with blow(s) from a blunt object. And at

trial, the doctor stated that a metal pole or a wooden pole would have been able to cause

the injury to the vertex of Nicholas’s head and to his face.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14

        The third matter involves Nicholas’s

allegedly incredible explanation for the absence of injuries on his hands. There is

nothing so incredible about his explanation. He had a major cut on the vertex of his head,

and injuries to his face. He was using his hands to fend off the blows, and just because

he did not sustain injuries to his hands does not lead to the conclusion that he could not

have been whacked on the head and face. After all, the doctor did say that if the

assailant was standing near the victim, there is the possibility that the victim not

sustain injuries to his hand. The absence of injuries to the victim’s hands does not

prompt the conclusion that he must have been the assailant himself.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15

        The fourth matter involves the half-drunken

condition of Nicholas on the morning of 5 December 2001. The District Judge was aware that

Lim and Nicholas had been drinking prior to the events at the appellant’s home.

However, they were not so intoxicated that they did not know what they were doing. The

doctor who examined Nicholas at hospital testified that the victim did not show signs of

disorientation. In fact, he was ‘alert, conscious, and responsive.’ </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16

        The fifth matter involves the appellant’s

commando training and relative sobriety. The appellant had been trained as a commando and

was stationed in Greece as part of his career tour. It is the appellant’s case that

it is due to his elite training that he was able to fend off four men without a scratch.

But if the commando was not deferent to fear why did he switch off his lights in order to

lead the supposed gang to the belief that he was not in? And if he wanted to lead them to

believe that he was not in, why didn’t he shut and lock the metal grill and door?

Instead he left the door and the grill unlocked. He had ample time in between the time he

alleged he saw the gang downstairs from his window and the time the alleged gang arrived

at the front of his flat. Instead of ensuring his safety, he left his grill and door

unlocked. This does not tally with his switching off the lights. There was no gang which

came to attack the appellant. It was the appellant who enrolled a gang to ambush and beat

up the victim at the appellant’s house.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17

        The sixth matter involves the position of the

two pools of blood. As shown in the photos, there were two pools of blood. The two pools

were in the corridor. There was no blood to be found in the house. This might tally with

the appellant’s claim that Nicholas fell backwards hitting his head on its vertex. I

reject this theory. The two pools <i>outside </i>the house and there being no blood trails

in the house can be explained by the trial judge’s description of what could very

actually have taken place. Nicholas only testified that he fell unconscious in the

appellant’s house. Thus, it could be that he was continually beaten even outside the

flat, but not to his knowledge. This is not inconsistent with the trial judge’s

findings. What the assailants did to Nicholas when he was unconscious we do not know.

Neither does Nicholas. But the absence of blood in the house should not affect the

conclusion that Nicholas was attacked and fell unconscious in the flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18

        The seventh matter involves the failure to find

the alleged third weapon.<b> </b>The total number of weapons is not important. The two

poles could have been the weapons which rendered the injury to Nicholas. But they need not

have been – this is so because of the nature of the unlawful assembly offence and how

it aims to attribute culpability through the medium of (potentially) just one act. All

other members, though using weapons which did not administer the fateful blow, are

vicariously liable through that one relevant action. Following this philosophy, there need

not be presented and accounted at trial the full compliment of weapons, and there need not

be present the one key weapon which dealt the fateful blow.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19

        The eighth matter involves the absence of blood

on the poles. Following from my point in the last paragraph, it is not imperative that the

prosecution produce the actual weapons used in an assault. It could very well have been

the case that more poles than these two were used. The victim stated in evidence: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I am not sure whether all the four guys

  carried poles but I saw that the two of them who were in front carried poles. I can’t

  tell if the two behind carried poles.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">There was therefore the very real

possibility that there were more than these two poles used. The appellant’s story

fails to convince this court that he was not the assailant in this ordeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20

        I move onto the inconsistencies in the

appellant’s case. The appellant’s story that the victim’s injury was

sustained by his falling backwards is put in very serious doubt by the fact that the

appellant testified that there was someone behind the victim before the fall took place.

In cross-examination, the appellant was asked :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q When you pushed Perez Nicholas out, you

  must have also indirectly pushed Vela Thomas who was behind out?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A I believe so. Vela Thomas who was behind

  Perez Nicholas moved backwards himself.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">If this Thomas (who was alleged present by

the appellant) was behind Nicholas, it would logically follow that Thomas would break, in

whole or in part, Nicholas’s fall. With the high likelihood of Thomas cushioning

Nicholas’s fall, the appellant’s story that Nicholas sustained his injury by

falling backwards becomes even less convincing than it already is.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Section 149 of the Penal Code states :</font></p></b>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">If an offence is committed by any member

  of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as

  the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that

  object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of

  the same assembly, is guilty of that offence.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21

        There being five people – the appellant

and four others – involved in the incident, the ingredients of the offence have been

proved. There is nothing in law which prevents the Court from finding that the unlawful

assembly consisted of the convicted persons and some unidentified persons (see <i>Ratanal

&amp; Dhirajlal’s ‘Law of Crimes : A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code’</i>

2002 Delhi at Chapter 8 page 602). </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Section 326 of the Penal Code </font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22

        The weapons used in committing the offence were

wooden and metal poles. These poles, if used in the manner which they were, are likely to

cause death – this confirms the appellant’s culpability under s326 of the Penal

Code. To this end, this Court should not disturb the finding of the trial judge. The

conviction should stand. I now turn to sentence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23

        According to the textbook, <i>Practitioner’s

Library, ‘Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts’, 2000 </i>the factors

to be taken into account when sentencing the accused under s 326 of the Penal Code are as

follows :-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1 Seriousness and permanence of injuries</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2 Group action</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3 Premeditated</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4 Weapon used</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5 Vulnerable victim</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6 Offender in position of authority</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7 Racial motivation</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8 Prior record of violence</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24

        It must be stressed that this attack was

carried out by a group. It was premeditated. The appellant had enrolled others into his

intention. This was not a one-off vengeful act but a planned one. And the weapons used

were poles – both wooden and metal. The appellant also has a prior record of

violence. He was convicted of voluntarily causing hurt under s323 of the penal Code, and

sentenced to one month imprisonment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25

        It is noteworthy that Nicholas stated on the

stand that if need be he would fight with the appellant at his home. But it must be

stressed that his aim of going over to the appellant’s home was to talk sternly to

him in order to come to the bottom of the disagreement. I stress here that before Nicholas

could even talk with the appellant he was pounced upon by four other men. I do not approve

of Nicholas’s desire to resolve issues through the fist, but in this case he was not

even given a chance to speak to the appellant. Thus, the fact that Nicholas wanted to

settle the matter by means of a fight, as a last resort, ought not to prompt this Court to

lessen the sentence. The bottom line is this – he was not even given a chance to

speak with the appellant. Instead he was pounced on by a pack of men.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The sentence should stand at 4 years

imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">For these reasons I dismiss the appeal.</font></p>
