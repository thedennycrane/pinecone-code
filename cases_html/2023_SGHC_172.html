It is a relationship concerning property ordinarily between the persons who hold that property on trust and those for whose benefit they do so. In an exceptional category of charitable purpose trusts, the trustees hold the trust property for the charitable purpose set out in the trust deed. As a trust is not a legal person, it cannot sue or be sued. It is the trustees who must sue or be sued in respect of the trust property or the administration of the trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this case the named plaintiff is Lian Chee Kek Buddhist Temple, which is said to be a charitable trust registered under the Charities Act 1994 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charities Act”). For reasons that will soon be evident, I shall refer to this party simply as the “Plaintiff”. As for the religious adherents who practise their faith at Lian Chee Kek Buddhist Temple, I shall refer to them neutrally as the “Worshippers”. In the originating summons, the Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the defendants hold certain land and premises as trustees on trust for the Plaintiff, and for the replacement of the defendants as trustees with certain senior Worshippers as new trustees. The defendants have applied in HC/SUM 223/2022 (“SUM 223”) to strike out this originating summons on the ground that the Plaintiff does not exist in law as a separate personality capable of suing or being sued. The Plaintiff responded in two ways. First, it contends that upon registration as a charity it acquired the capacity to commence charity proceedings under s 32 of the Charities Act. Second, in HC/SUM 3804/2022 (“SUM 3804”), two members of its management committee applied to be joined as plaintiffs (the “Additional Plaintiffs”). The Additional Plaintiffs have obtained the consent of the Attorney-General to do so under s 9(1) of the Government Proceedings Act 1956 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Government Proceedings Act”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Before the learned Assistant Registrar, the argument on behalf of the Plaintiff seems to have been put in terms of the Plaintiff being simply a “charity” or an “undertaking” clothed upon registration under the Charities Act with separate legal personality.

</div> In their application, the Trustees relied on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">cy-</span><span class="font-italic">près</span>. The Trustees informed the Commissioner that the Premises were occupied by “a buddhist temple styled ‘Lian Chee Kok Temple’”, which provided a place for general Buddhist worship not limited to the worship of Kwan Yin. The Trustees stated that the Premises were being underutilised and could be optimised for the advancement of Buddhism in Singapore by a transfer of the Premises to the Singapore Buddhist Federation. The Trustees therefore sought to alter the objects of the Trust and apply the Premises <span class="font-italic">cy-</span><span class="font-italic">près</span> under ss 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii) of the version of the Charities Act then in force (currently ss 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii) of the Charities Act). The Trustees also indicated their desire to gift an adjoining strip of land, described as being beneficially owned by the Trustees, to the Singapore Buddhist Federation, should their application succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The application ran into a roadblock. Before the Commissioner would consider the Trustees’ application, she required a certified statement of accounts for the previous five years (1993 to 1997) as well as a description of the activities carried out “by the Temple” since 1993.

The form required a declaration as to the nature of the legal entity making the application, providing five options, namely a society; a company limited by guarantee; a quasi-government organisation; a trust; or “others”. The option “others” was selected with the annotation “Buddhist Temple”. The date of establishment was given as 21 January 1958, the same date as the 1958 Indenture, and the land occupied for charitable purposes, identified as the Premises, was declared as being “Owned”. The form also required stating the particulars of “charity trustees”, which was submitted in an attached list. Fifteen persons were named, including Abbot Tjie, but no mention was made of any of the three defendants.

</div> It appears (but I need not and do not make a finding to this effect given the stage at which these appeals arise) that the defendants did not know about or approve this application. It also appears that the Commissioner proceeded to register the Plaintiff as a charity based on the constitution and management committee furnished by Abbot Tjie in this application, even though previous correspondence in 1998 had come from the defendants’ lawyers. The original constitution of the Plaintiff submitted by Abbot Tjie did not make any reference to the 1958 Indenture. Apparently, it was the Commissioner that required the addition of a clause expressly referring to the 1958 Indenture in the constitution, and the Commissioner who provided Abbot Tjie with a copy of the 1958 Indenture in response to his initial application.

Although the drafting is not a model of clarity, it also appears that the general meeting may consider proposals to remove trustees.

This extended to proceeding with additions and alterations to the Premises between 2017 and 2019 without the approval of the Trustees. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) appears to have picked up on the absence of consent on the part of the registered proprietors of the Premises when the Plaintiff sought approval of the renovation works in 2020. By letter dated 12 January 2021, the URA required the Plaintiff to provide this consent, noting that the Premises were not owned by the President of the Plaintiff, who had been erroneously declared as the owner of the Premises in the Plaintiff’s application for approval.

For this purpose, they formed an unincorporated association: a group of persons organised for a common purpose and bound by contractual rules governing their association (<span class="font-italic">Life Bible-Presbyterian Church v Khoo Eng Teck Jeffrey and others and another suit</span> [2010] SGHC 187 at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell (Inspector of Taxes)</span> [1982] 1 WLR 522). These rules were contained in the Plaintiff’s constitution. They did not register this association under the Societies Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Societies Act”), but simply submitted an application to the Commissioner seeking charitable status. There is no reference to the defendants in the application because those identified as “charity trustees” were drawn from the members of the unincorporated association.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Abbot Tjie did not himself believe that the registration of the Plaintiff as a charity would in any way affect the Trust, which he knew was a trust over the Premises and for the purpose set out in the 1958 Indenture (see above at [5]).

</div>
</div>
</div> This belief is correct. The registration of the unincorporated association and the adoption of a constitution governing the association cannot overreach the provisions of the 1958 Indenture. The charitable purpose, and indeed the charitable status, is distinct from the institutional form (<span class="font-italic">Zhao Hui Fang and others v Commissioner of Stamp Duties</span> [2017] 4 SLR 945 at [100], referring to <span class="font-italic">Khoo Jeffrey and others v Life Bible-Presbyterian Church and others</span> [2011] 3 SLR 500 at [33]). The fact that Abbot Tjie succeeded in registering the unincorporated association as a charity did not change the fact that it remained an unincorporated association in law. The fact that the unincorporated association was for a stated purpose consistent with the purpose of the Trust under the 1958 Indenture did not alter its character or transform it into a trust, let alone the Trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is trite that an unincorporated association is not a legal entity separate from its members. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng v Chu Sheng Temple</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1396 noted at [28]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An unincorporated association consists of a mere aggregate of individuals, and is not a legal entity capable of suing or being sued in its own name: see <span class="font-italic">Chen Cheng v Central Christian Church</span> [1995] 3 SLR (R) 806 … at [6]. An unincorporated association may, however, be clothed with legal personality by Parliament through legislation such as the Societies Act: see <span class="font-italic">Chen Cheng</span> at [8]. But, unless and until such legal personality is conferred by statute, an unincorporated association has no legal existence separate from the members who comprise it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Unlike the Societies Act, which expressly empowers registered societies to sue or be sued (pursuant to s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Societies Act), the Charities Act contains no equivalent provision conferring legal personality upon a registered charity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The formation of the unincorporated association ran parallel to the continued existence of the Trust. Abbot Tjie may have believed that being conferred charitable status by the Commissioner meant that he could now manage the Premises without reference to the Trustees, but that was not correct. The Premises continued to belong to the Trust, and it was the Trustees who had the power to manage the Premises in accordance with the 1958 Indenture (see above at [7]). Abbot Tjie could not abrogate this power. Abbot Tjie ought to have first sought the consent of the Trustees to his proposed additions and alterations to the Premises before undertaking them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: If the Plaintiff is a trust, has it been conferred a separate legal personality by registration under the Charities Act? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 While this question is moot, given that the Plaintiff is not in fact a trust but an unincorporated association, it is worth considering the argument further. Indeed, if it is the case that registration under the Charities Act confers a separate legal personality on a trust, then it could do the same for an unincorporated association. The argument that succeeded below was that, upon registration, the Plaintiff had been conferred the right to sue by virtue of s 32(1) of the Charities Act, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Taking of legal proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32.—(1)  Charity proceedings may be taken with reference to a charity either by the charity, or by any of the governing board members, or by any person interested in the charity, but not by any other person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The argument before me ran as follows. Section 2 of the Charities Act defines “charity” to mean “any institution, corporate or not, which is established for charitable purposes” and “institution” to include “any trust”. Thus, when s 32(1) of the Charities Act states that charity proceedings may be taken “by the charity”, this means that the charity as such may take legal proceedings, even though prior to being recognised as a charity it did not have a separate legal personality or the capacity to sue or be sued.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I am unable to agree with this argument. Unlike the Societies Act, the Charities Act has no empowering provision. In my view, s 32 of the Charities Act establishes <span class="font-italic">additional</span> qualifications that a party seeking to commence charity proceedings must have. First, they must come within the requirements of s 32(1), and second, they must obtain prior authority from the Commissioner. It neither grants legal personality to anything that does not already have it, nor vests the capacity to sue in anyone who has no such capacity in the first place. It may be helpful to illustrate this by way of an example. There are many charities for the protection of children. It is possible that a child might be considered someone “interested” in such a charity. But a child, no matter how determined, has no capacity to commence legal proceedings generally (see O 4 r 1 of the Rules of Court 2021). That a child might be described as a “person interested in the charity” within s 32(1) of the Charities Act in respect of a particular charity does not mean that that child would have capacity to commence charity proceedings in their own name. The correct position is that nothing under the Charities Act alters what the general law requires before a party may commence legal proceedings. In the case of a charitable trust, charity proceedings brought “by the charity” under s 32(1) of the Charities Act would mean an action commenced by the trustees in their capacity as trustees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I note that the Attorney-General and Commissioner both agree with my view. I accept their submission that the charity must have been established as an “institution” prior to registration, and their submission that the act of registration does not alter or confer legal personality. They also point out that the charitable status of an institution may be revoked in certain circumstances by the Commissioner pursuant to s 7(3) of the Charities Act, but this is entirely independent from the continued legal existence of the institution. For example, a company that is removed from the register of charities does not by that very fact also get wound-up and struck off the register of companies.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Attorney-General has made abundantly clear that he takes no position on the true institutional form of the Plaintiff, whether the Plaintiff has standing, or what is the precise relationship between the Trust and the Plaintiff, and still less on whether the alleged breach of trust was made out. However, he did submit that the grant of consent is not open to challenge within these proceedings, any more than a decision of the Attorney-General to institute or be joined as a party to the proceedings himself. When the Attorney-General institutes such a suit himself or authorises others to do so, he acts in his capacity as protector of charities. The Attorney-General submits that court’s role would not be to second-guess the decision to grant consent to the action, but to decide the action on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 While I note the persuasiveness of his submissions, I do not need to decide the question of whether it is open to parties to challenge the grant of consent by the Attorney-General in the very proceedings for which consent has already been given. This is because it is clear in my view that I should not exercise my discretion to permit joinder under O 15 r 6 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Plaintiff’s argument in favour of the joinder is that the additional plaintiffs are “necessary parties”. Thus, they rely on the necessity limb in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the ROC 2014, which provides for the addition of any party if “necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon”. In a literal sense, given that I have found that the Plaintiff has no capacity or standing, and I have struck out its action, the Additional Plaintiffs are needed to push forward any allegation of breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Assuming that the Additional Plaintiffs satisfy the necessity limb, the court nevertheless retains a discretion whether or not to permit joinder. At this stage, considerations of fairness and the balance of justice come to the fore. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v </span><span class="font-italic">Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 894 explained at [205]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the discretionary stage, the court’s concerns are substantially similar whether the necessity limb or the just and convenient limb is relied upon. It should not be thought that where the necessity limb is successfully invoked, and the non-discretionary requirement is met, joinder will follow as a matter of course. Although the need to effectually and completely determine a dispute is in itself a strong reason for joinder, it is entirely possible for countervailing concerns of fairness (among other things) to override it. Either way, the court will consider all the factors which are relevant to the balance of justice in a particular case …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  In my view, it will not be just or fair to join the Additional Plaintiffs to this originating summons. This is because the originating summons as it stands is not in the right shape or form to facilitate the fair or expeditious resolution of whatever the real issues are now asserted to be. The relief sought in the originating summons is first and foremost declarations that the removal of the defendants as trustees of the Trust and the appointment of new trustees of the Trust as resolved by the Plaintiff in general meeting on 26 June 2021 is valid and effectual (see above at [17]). This prayer is wholly misconceived. What the unincorporated association of persons have agreed among themselves in relation to the running of the religious activities on the Premises has no effect whatsoever on the provisions for appointment of trustees contained in the 1958 Indenture. The fact that the Plaintiff’s constitution included provisions for the removal of trustees <span class="font-italic">of the unincorporated association</span> does not mean that it can remove the Trustees <span class="font-italic">of the Trust</span>. Indeed, this was recognised by WST and Abbot Tjie himself when they requested that the defendants retire and appoint new trustees by deed.

</div>
</div>
</div> The only way to replace the Trustees is in accordance with proviso (1) of the 1958 Indenture (see above at [6]), unless a court can be persuaded to exercise its power under s 42 of the Trustees Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Trustees Act”) to appoint new trustees on the ground of expedience. Although the title of this originating summons mentions s 42 of the Trustees Act, reliance is placed on it only to the effect that the passing of the resolutions made it expedient to remove the defendants as Trustees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 If, as the Additional Plaintiffs seek to contend, the defendants should be removed as Trustees because they have committed breach of trust, then such a claim should properly have been brought by way of a writ of summons, or if commenced today, an originating claim. A writ action or originating claim is more suitable for the determination of an allegation of breach of trust. Pleadings would identify the allegations with precision, enabling the defendants to know what case they have to meet, rather than implied or inferred allegations arising from correspondence or affidavits. The facts relevant to whether Abbot Tjie was justified in not informing the defendants of his additions and alterations before carrying them out, running afoul of the authorities, and then expecting the defendants to consent to his <span class="font-italic">fait accompli </span>lest their failure to so consent expose them to an accusation of breach of trust, are all matters that need to be inquired into at trial. The facts and evidence must be tested with cross-examination of, among others, Abbot Tjie himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 WST, acting also as counsel for the Additional Plaintiffs, suggests that upon joinder or substitution of parties they will consider applying to convert the originating summons into a writ. That, in my view, is not a sufficient answer. The Additional Plaintiffs, if so minded, are at liberty to commence fresh proceedings by originating claim with pleadings and oral evidence that will ensure that all matters may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 A further point must be made in the event the Additional Plaintiffs intend to commence fresh proceedings. The consent of the Attorney-General must be sought under s 9 of the Government Proceedings Act if the action is based on breach of trust. If the Additional Plaintiffs are of the view that the fresh proceedings constitute “charity proceedings”, proper authorisation must be obtained from the Commissioner under s 32(2) of the Charities Act. As held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association and others v Singapore Rifle Association</span> [2020] 1 SLR 395 (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association</span>”), any authorisation obtained from the Commissioner to commence charity proceedings will be interpreted strictly. The authorisation will be limited to the precise heads of claim or reliefs sought, and the authorised party cannot be allowed to pursue new claims outside the scope of authorisation (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association</span> at [161]). It is not permissible for the Additional Plaintiffs to seek the addition of a new prayer, as they have in their submissions to me,
