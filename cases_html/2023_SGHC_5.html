The starting point is 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Section 105 provides that the “burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In a civil action, it is in the pleadings that each party sets out, whether by way of claim or defence, the facts which it wants the court to believe to be true. Accordingly, a proper consideration of the allocation of the burden of proof begins with a consideration of the pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff bears the burden of proving the loans</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In his statement of claim, the plaintiff pleads the following two principal facts: (a) that the plaintiff entered into three loan agreements with the defendant under which it lent $4m to the defendant; <span class="font-italic">and</span> (b) that Mr Ho had actual express or ostensible authority to conclude the loan agreements on the defendant’s behalf. The plaintiff thereby formally states its wish that the court believes these two facts to be true. Section 105 of the Act therefore operates to place the legal burden of proving both facts on the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s claim in debt will fail if he fails to discharge his burden on <span class="font-italic">either</span> fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In its defence, the defendant pleads a positive case as to the reason for the plaintiff paying $4m to the defendant (see [12]–[14] above). In so far as the defendant wishes the court to believe those facts to be true, s 105 of the Act places the legal burden of proving those facts on the defendant. But persuading the court to believe those facts to be true is not the only means by which the defendant can succeed in its defence to the plaintiff’s claim in debt. Another means by which the defendant can succeed is simply by demonstrating that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his legal burden of proving <span class="font-italic">either</span> of the two principal facts he has pleaded. Thus, the defendant can succeed simply by demonstrating that the plaintiff has failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff paid the $4m to the defendant <span class="font-italic">as </span><span class="font-italic">loans</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The same point can be put from the court’s perspective as follows. The court’s task in analysing the plaintiff’s claim in debt is not to decide whether the plaintiff’s positive case as to the true reason for his having paid $4m to the defendant is more likely to be true than the defendant’s positive case on that issue or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. The court’s task is to determine only whether the plaintiff has proven his case on the balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Rhesa</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping Company SA v Edmunds (The Popi M)</span> [1985] 1 WLR 948; <span class="font-italic">Clarke Beryl Claire (personal representative of the estate of Eugene Francis Clarke, deceased) and others v SilkAir (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1136 at [63]; <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh s/o Jagdish Singh and another (administrators of the estate of </span><span class="font-italic">Narindar Kaur d/o Sarwan Singh, deceased) v Li Man Kay and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 428 at [121]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No presumption of an obligation to repay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 An evidential question then arises as to whether an obligation to repay the $4m can be presumed simply by reason of the defendant’s formal admission, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> its admission on the pleadings, that it <span class="font-italic">receiv</span><span class="font-italic">ed</span> the $4m from the plaintiff. If so, that would suffice to place an evidential burden on the defendant to disprove an obligation to repay the money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is true that, in <span class="font-italic">Seldon v Davidson </span>[1968] 1 WLR 1083 (“<span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>”), the English Court of Appeal held that a payment of money to a stranger gives rise <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>to an implied obligation to repay the money. It is also true that, in <span class="font-italic">Power Solar System Co Ltd (in liquidation) v </span><span class="font-italic">Suntech Power Investment Pte Ltd </span>[2018] SGHC 233 (“<span class="font-italic">Power Solar System</span>”), Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi JC (as she then was) held that <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was part of Singapore law (at [103(c)]). Chionh JC concluded that, when a plaintiff proves the payment of a sum of money to a defendant in the absence of a plausible explanation for the payment, a presumption of an obligation to repay the sum arises, thereby casting an evidential burden on the defendant on this issue. If the defendant fails to address that evidential burden, the plaintiff will have discharged his legal burden and the court will be entitled to find that the parties intended the sum to be repaid (at [103(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 More recently, however, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT Bayan Resources TBK and another v BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another </span>[2019] 1 SLR 30 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Bayan</span>”) held that a defendant’s plea admitting only that it had <span class="font-italic">received</span> a sum of money from a plaintiff was not the same as a plea admitting that the sum was a <span class="font-italic">debt</span> (at [144]). Since the defendant in <span class="font-italic">PT Bayan</span> had admitted receiving the money but had also gone on to plead that the sum was a gift from the plaintiff, his defence did not admit that he was <span class="font-italic">indebted</span> to the plaintiff in that sum. The legal and the evidential burden of proving that the payment was a loan remained on the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Even more recently, in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hock v Teo Cher Koon and another and another appeal </span>[2022] 2 SLR 314 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hock</span>”), the Appellate Division of the High Court (“the AD”) applied this <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of the Court of Appeal from <span class="font-italic">PT Bayan</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hock</span>, the plaintiff alleged that it had paid certain sums to the defendant under a loan agreement. In response, the defendant’s pleading denied ever incurring a debt to the plaintiff (at [66]). The AD held that this pleading left both the legal and the evidential burden on the plaintiff to prove the purpose of the payments, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to prove that the payments were loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 These observations apply squarely to the present case. The defendant’s pleading admits receiving the $4m from the plaintiff but denies that it incurred any debt whatsoever to the plaintiff as a result.

</div> But his conduct in extending the alleged loans to the defendant deviated significantly from the conduct which would be expected of an experienced businessman. The most significant deviation is that the plaintiff failed to document the alleged loans. This deviation is particularly significant given the high interest rate which the plaintiff alleges he charged the defendant on the first loan. That interest rate was 10% for the one-month duration of the loan, equivalent to 120% per annum. Risk and reward being directly correlated, an interest rate that high suggests that the plaintiff saw himself as taking on a very high risk by extending the first alleged loan to the defendant. That, in turn, suggests a very high risk of delayed repayment or default and a very high risk of litigation to recover the alleged loan. In any litigation, it would be essential to prove the loan. It is contrary to the inherent probabilities that an experienced businessman lending this quantum of money in these circumstances and on these terms, as the plaintiff alleges he did, would have done so without documenting the loans, even informally by a simple IOU or WhatsApp message. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, the plaintiff is not just an experienced businessman but also an experienced moneylender. Furthermore, he has substantial experience of actually having to resort to litigation to recover money from his borrowers.

</div>
</div>
</div> I do not accept this explanation for three reasons. First, a borrower asking for a loan in circumstances of urgency is an indication of higher than usual risk and therefore of a need to take greater than usual steps to protect the lender’s interests in the event of default and litigation to recover the loan. The alleged circumstances of urgency undermine the plaintiff’s case rather than supporting it. Second, even if the defendant needed the money urgently, there was no commercial reason for the plaintiff to indulge the defendant by acting in haste and thereby increasing the plaintiff’s own risk in the transaction. There is no suggestion, for example, that the plaintiff was for whatever reason desperate to lend the funds. Third, the first alleged loan may have been advanced in circumstances of urgency, but the second and third alleged loans were not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiff also suggests that one reason for his deviations from his own past practice was because he was advised by lawyers in his past moneylending transactions but was not advised by lawyers in these three alleged loan agreements.

</div> I do not accept this explanation. First, the risk factors I have identified would have made it more likely that an experienced businessman and an experienced moneylender would have sought legal advice in relation to these alleged loans. Second, the deviations I have identified are matters of commercial risk analysis and mitigation, not matters of law requiring specialist advice. An experienced businessman and an experienced moneylender such as the plaintiff is well able to perform this commercial risk analysis and mitigation himself, without legal advice. Third, by the time of these three alleged loan agreements, the plaintiff had already advanced sums of money to other borrowers supported by loan documentation drawn up by lawyers. It would have been a simple task for the plaintiff to have undertaken his own risk analysis and adapted those documents or adopted the risk mitigation features in those documents for the purposes of any alleged loans which he might extend to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the claim in debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I therefore hold that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proving that the sum of $4m which he paid to the defendant in September and October 2016 was paid to the defendant as loans. I therefore have no evidential basis on which to find that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff. That suffices in itself to cause the plaintiff’s claim to fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The plaintiff’s failure to discharge his burden of proof on the existence of the loans means that his claim fails without any need for me to consider the defendant’s specific and positive defences. It is therefore not necessary for me to decide whether Mr Ho had any type of authority from the defendant to seek loans or to enter into loan agreements on behalf of the defendant. It is also not necessary – and would indeed be wrong in principle (see [19] above) – for me to undertake the exercise of deciding whether the defendant’s reason for the plaintiff paying $4m to the defendant is more likely to be true than not or is more likely to be true than the plaintiff’s reason for his paying $4m to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claim in unjust enrichment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I now turn to consider the plaintiff’s alternative claim, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that the defendant is liable to make restitution to the plaintiff of $4m in the law of unjust enrichment.

In <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span><span class="font-italic"> Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Benzline</span>”), the Court of Appeal accepted this distinction (at [48]) and stated that in the law of restitution, the term “failure of consideration” is synonymous with “failure of basis” (at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the law of unjust enrichment, a payer will recover money he has paid to a payee on the unjust factor of a total failure of consideration if the payer can establish that the basis on which the payer paid the money to the payee has completely failed. It is that failure which renders the recipient’s continued retention of the money unjust for the purposes of the law of unjust enrichment. The payee will be ordered to return the money to the payer, unless the payee can make out one of the established defences to a claim in unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To analyse the plaintiff’s case on the unjust factor of a total failure of consideration, therefore, I must determine: (a) the basis for the payment which the plaintiff now seeks to recover; and (b) whether that basis has failed (<span class="font-italic">Benzline</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is possible for the basis of a payment to be a contract and for the basis to fail by reason of a vitiating factor rendering the contract void. An example of this is where a party to a putative contract makes a payment to the counterparty while both parties are labouring under a common mistake sufficiently fundamental to render the contract void (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua Siok Kui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 363 at [43(c)], citing <span class="font-italic">Aqua Art Pte Ltd v Goodman Development (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 865 at [23]–[28]). The present case is quite unlike those cases. In those cases, the parties believed that they had a contract, and that contract formed the basis for a payment at the time the payment was made. Unknown to the parties, the law rendered their putative contract void. The vitiation of the contract served both to destroy the basis for the payment thereby establishing the total failure of consideration as an unjust factor and, at the same time, to wipe away the contract and the allocation of risks agreed within it as a legal bar to recovery in unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the present case, I have found that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proving that he entered into any loan agreements with the defendant. That means the plaintiff has failed to establish that there was ever any contract whatever to form the basis for his payments to the defendant. The question of whether that non-existent basis has failed cannot arise. Therefore, this case does not come within the rubric of a total failure of consideration as an unjust factor. It must fail on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The next question is whether the plaintiff has adequately advanced an alternative case on failure of basis which might cater for the situation in which he now finds himself. But when the plaintiff’s pleadings are read in context, the only failure of basis which he has pleaded is the failure of the loan agreements to bind the defendant in the event the plaintiff is unable to prove that Mr Ho had the defendant’s authority to enter into them. The plaintiff has pleaded no specific or precise basis for the payment on which he relies as an alternative basis for the purposes of this unjust factor. In particular, the plaintiff has pleaded no alternative case as to the basis for the payment to cater for the situation in which he now finds himself, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> where the plaintiff’s case fails without any need for the court to consider the issue of Mr Ho’s authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Counsel for the plaintiff did suggest in oral submissions that the basis of the payment was a common understanding with Mr Ho that the defendant would repay the money. The plaintiff attempts to distinguish this basis for the payments from the alleged loan agreements as the basis for the payments by arguing that the common understanding now alleged was only as to <span class="font-italic">repayment</span> of the $4m and did not extend to the other terms of the alleged loan agreements such as the obligation to pay interest. In other words, the plaintiff invites me to find that – even if he is unable to prove on the balance of probabilities that he entered into the loan agreements on the contractual terms alleged – he is nevertheless able to prove on the balance of probabilities at least a common understanding between him and Mr Ho on behalf of the defendant that the defendant would repay the principal sum of $4m to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiff cannot rely on this “common understanding” to recover $4m from the defendant in the law of unjust enrichment. I come to that conclusion for five reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 First, this point was not pleaded. It is true that the plaintiff pleaded a total failure of consideration in general terms.

</div> But that plea, when read in context in the statement of claim, clearly posits: (a) that the alleged loan agreements were the intended contractual basis for the plaintiff’s payments to the defendant; and (b) that the basis for the plaintiff’s payments was the defendant’s reciprocal obligations under each of those agreements as an indivisible whole. As pleaded, the alleged loan agreements were contracts comprising a package of three broad obligations: (a) to repay the money; (b) to repay the money by a specific date; and (c) to pay interest on the money. The plaintiff did not attempt, in his statement of claim, to separate the loan agreements into their constituent obligations and to suggest that the basis for the payments which failed was just one of those constituent obligations taken alone and recharacterised as a freestanding understanding somehow falling short of a contractual obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, this specific point was not put to Mr Ho during his cross-examination.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Third, in any event, even if the point was pleaded in the statement of claim and put to Mr Ho in cross-examination, I would reject it as a ground for restitution. The plaintiff’s failure to persuade me on the balance of probabilities as to the existence of the loan agreements comprehends a failure to persuade me on all of the three constituent obligations in any alleged loan agreement. This includes any obligation – or even understanding falling short of an obligation – that the defendant was to repay the money. To the extent that a separate finding of fact is required on this alleged “common understanding”, I find as a fact that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proving any such common understanding as to repayment for all of the same reasons I have given for finding that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proving the existence of the loan agreements (see [25]–[36] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Fourth, in so far as the plaintiff argues that his payment of money to the defendant gave rise <span class="font-italic">ipso </span><span class="font-italic">facto </span>to a legal obligation to repay the money, this argument is contrary to the law of unjust enrichment, or the law of quasi-contract as it used to be known. In substance, this argument posits that there is an implied legal obligation under the substantive law to repay sums paid without reason. That is not the law. It rests on the now discredited “implied obligation” theory of the law of restitution (<span class="font-italic">Esben</span><span class="font-italic"> Finance Ltd and others v Wong Hou-Lianq Neil </span>[2022] 1 SLR 136 at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Finally, even taking the plaintiff’s argument at its highest and assuming that a common understanding to repay the $4m can be implied, and that this common understanding was the basis for the plaintiff’s payment of $4m to the defendant, the plaintiff’s claim to recover the $4m in unjust enrichment for a failure of this alleged basis must fail. On this assumption, the event which is to be characterised as a failure of the basis can only be one of two things: (a) the defendant’s denial of any obligation to repay the money in the correspondence before action; or (b) the defendant’s failure in fact to repay the money in accordance with the alleged common understanding. Accepting that either of these two bases can amount to a total failure of basis warranting restitution in the law of unjust enrichment would amount to using the law of unjust enrichment to undermine the law of contract. It would elevate what is alleged to be merely an understanding (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> not amounting to a contract) into a legal obligation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a contract) despite the absence of the consideration necessary to have that effect in the law of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Therefore, the plaintiff’s alternative claim in unjust enrichment must fail, whether it is based on a mistake or on a total failure of basis, and however the basis is characterised. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Absence of basis is not an unjust factor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The outcome of my analysis is that the defendant is under no obligation in the law of unjust enrichment to make restitution to the plaintiff of the $4m which it received from the plaintiff. Further, because the plaintiff has failed to establish an unjust factor justifying recovery in the law of unjust enrichment, the question of defences (such as a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> change of position) does not even arise. It therefore appears that the defendant is entitled the $4m: (a) even though it readily accepts that the payment was not a gift; (b) even if its positive case on the reason for the payment cannot be proven or is actually false; and (c) without any need for me to consider whether the defendant has changed its position <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>following the receipt of the $4m, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> by spending the money <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The outcome of my analysis appears extremely odd. The defendant would be entitled to retain the $4m even if the money was still lying intact and untouched in its bank account. But this odd outcome is the result of a well-known feature of the common law of unjust enrichment. The law of unjust enrichment does not reverse a voluntary payment simply because the payment was made without a basis or without a reason. The law of unjust enrichment reverses only those enrichments which it deems to be unjust. And it deems an enrichment to be unjust only if the person seeking to reverse it is able to plead and prove a recognised unjust factor (<span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiaw Sek Anna</span>”) at [129]–[134]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The common law’s “unjust factors” approach to reversing unjust enrichment is to be contrasted with the civil law’s “absence of basis” approach to the same issue. The “absence of basis” approach posits that once a defendant has been enriched at a claimant’s expense, restitution must follow in the “absence of any juristic reason … for the enrichment” (Andrew Burrows, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Restitution </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2011) at p 96, citing <span class="font-italic">Rathwell v Rathwell </span>(1978) 83 DLR (3d) 289, 306). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff may well have succeeded in recovering the $4m from the defendant if Singapore’s common law had adopted the “absence of basis” approach to reversing unjust enrichment. But as the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Wee</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiaw Sek Anna </span>at [129], the “absence of basis” approach has generally not found favour amongst common law scholars and has not taken root in the common law of unjust enrichment. Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Esben</span><span class="font-italic"> Finance </span>also cautioned against an expansion of the common law of unjust enrichment (at [247]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The case of <span class="font-italic">Big Island Construction (HK) Ltd v Wu Yi Development Co Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Anor </span>[2015] HKCU 1437 (“<span class="font-italic">Big Island Construction</span>”) illustrates my point. There, as in the present case, the plaintiff paid a large sum of money to the defendant for a disputed reason. The plaintiff claimed that it had paid the money as a loan. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff had paid the money to discharge certain obligations it owed the defendants. The trial judge dismissed the plaintiff’s claim, holding that it had “failed miserably to discharge the burden of proving its primary claim” (at [13]) in debt. Although it as unnecessary for his decision, the trial judge also went on to reject the defendant’s case as to the reason for the payment, finding it to be “improbable” (at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, the plaintiff contended that the consequence of the trial judge’s rejection of both parties’ reasons for the payment as improbable was that there was an absence of basis for the payment, entitling the plaintiff to recover the money in the law of unjust enrichment (at [66]). The court dismissed the argument, holding that to succeed in unjust enrichment at common law, a plaintiff cannot recover simply by establishing an “absence of basis” for the enrichment (at [67]–[71]). A plaintiff must establish an unjust factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the present case, the plaintiff put forward only one reason for the payment (that it was a loan). The plaintiff failed to discharge its burden of proving that reason. That failure leaves the plaintiff’s payment to the defendant evidentially indistinguishable from a voluntary payment made without reason. The plaintiff has failed to plead and prove any alternative basis for his payment which has failed, let alone any other unjust factor entitling him to restitution. The outcome in the present case may be odd, but that oddity is a known feature of the common law of unjust enrichment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In conclusion, I have found that the plaintiff has failed to prove his pleaded case as to the reason for his payment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was a loan of $4m to the defendant. His claim in debt fails. I have also found that the plaintiff has failed to plead and prove an unjust factor. His alternative claim in unjust enrichment therefore also fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I have therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s action. After hearing oral submissions on costs, I have ordered the plaintiff to pay to the defendant the costs of and incidental to this action, such costs fixed at $132,300. </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Prakash Pillai, Koh Junxiang and Ng Pi Wei (Clasis LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Choon Guan Daniel, Wong Hui Yi Genevieve and Lim Khoon (Eldan Law LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
