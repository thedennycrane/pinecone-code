        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal and cross-appeal (collectively, “the present
                    appeals”) arose out of the judgment of the trial judge (“the
                    Judge”) in Suit No 129 of 2008 (“Suit 129”) (see
                        <em>Lew Chee Fai Kevin v WBL Corp Ltd</em> [2010]
                    4 SLR 774 (“the Judgment”)). For ease of reference in
                    the present appeals, we will refer to Kevin Lew Chee Fai as “Lew”
                    and WBL Corporation Limited as “WBL” instead of as “the
                    appellant” and “the respondent” in their respective
                    appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Lew was, at the material time, the Group General Manager of WBL’s
                    Enterprise Risk Management Group. He commenced proceedings against WBL, seeking,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, specific performance of
                    WBL’s obligation to issue him a total of 167,500 shares in WBL
                    (“the Relevant Shares”) under an Executive Share Options Scheme
                    (“ESOS”). WBL had refused to issue the Relevant Shares to Lew
                    because he had purportedly paid for them using the proceeds from share
                    transactions that were alleged to constitute insider trading. WBL’s
                    defence was that it was not in breach of its obligation under the ESOS to issue
                    the Relevant Shares to Lew (referred to hereafter as WBL’s
                    “contractual obligation under the ESOS to issue the Relevant
                    Shares” where appropriate) because it would have been illegal under
                    either the common law or s 44 or s 47 of the Corruption, Drug
                    Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act
                    (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the CDSA”) to issue those
                    shares. Suit 129 was heard before the Judge together with Suit No 71
                    of 2009 (“Suit 71”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Suit 71 was the action by the Monetary Authority of Singapore
                    (“MAS”) against Lew for violating the insider trading provisions
                    of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    SFA”), the alleged insider trade being Lew’s sale of 90,000 shares
                    in WBL on 4 July 2007 (“the Transaction”). Suit 71 was a
                        <em>civil</em> action and MAS sought a civil penalty
                    under s 232(2) of the SFA. The Judge found Lew liable for insider trading
                    under s 218 of the SFA and therefore liable to pay a civil penalty. We
                    dismissed Lew’s appeal against that decision in Civil Appeal No 123
                    of 2010 (“CA 123”) and delivered our grounds in <em>Lew Chee Fai Kevin v Monetary Authority of Singapore</em>
                    [2012] SGCA 12 (“<em>Kevin Lew v
                    MAS</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       For the purposes of this judgment, we will proceed on the basis of the facts
                    established in <em>Kevin Lew v MAS</em>, together with the
                    relevant additional facts below.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lew’s exercise of his ESOS share options with proceeds from the
                Transaction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As stated in <em>Kevin Lew v MAS</em> at [1], 2 July 2007 was the date on which Lew
                    allegedly acquired confidential, price-sensitive information about WBL at an
                    internal executive meeting. 4 July 2007 was the date of the Transaction,
                        <em>ie</em>, the date on which Lew sold 90,000 of his
                    WBL shares. On 9 July 2007, Lew submitted two notices to WBL pursuant to
                    cl 8(a) of the ESOS for the Relevant Shares to be issued to him pursuant to
                    the options granted on, respectively, 21 January 2000 and 6 February
                    2004 (“the Options”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Lew raised a total of $446,773.26 from the Transaction and he tendered two
                    cheques totalling $485,110 (“the Cheques”) as payment for the
                    Relevant Shares. It is not disputed that the Cheques were drawn from the
                    proceeds received from the Transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Pursuant to WBL’s obligation under s 39 of the CDSA to make a
                    report if it had knowledge or reasonable grounds to suspect that any property
                    represented the proceeds of criminal conduct, WBL lodged a Suspicious
                    Transaction Report with the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”)
                    on 17 July 2007 with regard to the Transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WBL declines to issue the Relevant Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Lew resigned from WBL on 19 July 2007. In his resignation letter, he
                    reminded WBL that he had applied to exercise the Options and sought confirmation
                    that he was entitled to do so. WBL did not respond to Lew’s question on
                    the Options.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Lew thus wrote again on 27 December 2007 seeking a response. WBL’s
                    reply on 8 January 2008 was that it was “bound by legal
                        restrictions”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> from taking any action with respect to Lew’s purported
                    exercise of the Options using the proceeds from the Transaction. WBL took the
                    position that it was entitled to decline to issue the Relevant Shares to Lew
                    because the Options had been exercised using the proceeds of the
                    Transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Lew then commenced the proceedings below seeking, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, specific performance of WBL’s contractual obligation
                    under the ESOS to issue the Relevant Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision below and the parties’ respective
                appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge held that WBL would have contravened s 44 of the CDSA if it had
                    issued Lew the Relevant Shares pursuant to his purported exercise of the Options
                    on 9 July 2007. However, the Judge also held that there was a means by
                    which WBL could have legally performed its contractual obligation to issue those
                    shares to Lew, <em>ie</em>, by obtaining the consent of CAD
                    under s 44(3) of the CDSA for the shares to be issued. Section 44(3)
                    of the CDSA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Where a person <em>discloses to an

<p class="Judg-1">Under cl 8(b) of the ESOS, WBL was obliged to avail itself of this means
                    of legally performing its contractual obligation under the ESOS to issue the
                    Relevant Shares. The Judge therefore directed WBL to seek the consent of CAD to
                    issue those shares to Lew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As we stated at the outset, the present appeals consist of an appeal and a
                    cross-appeal against the Judge’s decision. Civil Appeal No 149 of
                    2010 (“CA 149”) is WBL’s appeal against the
                    Judge’s direction that it must apply to CAD for consent to issue the
                    Relevant Shares to Lew. WBL also appealed against the Judge’s order
                    awarding Lew costs. Civil Appeal No 150 of 2010
                    (“CA 150”) is Lew’s appeal against the Judge’s
                    decision in so far as it was held that WBL would have contravened s 44(1)
                    of the CDSA had it issued the Relevant Shares to Lew pursuant to his exercise of
                    the Options on 9 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview and issues arising in these appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In order for Lew to be granted specific performance of WBL’s contractual
                    obligation under the ESOS to issue the Relevant Shares, it must be proven that
                    WBL was under a contractual obligation to do so. There is no dispute that the
                    WBL was under such an obligation unless performing it was contrary to law by
                    virtue of Condition 19 of the ESOS. WBL’s main argument was that it
                    was contrary to law for it to issue the new WBL shares to Lew by virtue of
                    either s 44 <em>or </em><em>s </em>47 of the CDSA.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Section 44(1), if it applies to the present facts at all, would make it
                    illegal on WBL’s part to issue the Relevant Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, it is unnecessary for us to even consider the applicability of
                    s 44(1) because s 44 of the CDSA does not apply at all to WBL in the
                    first place. In the course of argument, counsel for WBL drew our attention to
                    s 40 of the CDSA which, he conceded, could undermine entirely his argument
                    based on s 44(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii). We would
                    agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Section 40 of the CDSA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Protection where information
                            given under section 39</b>

                            after having the knowledge referred to in that subsection, the person or
                            his officer, employee or agent shall be taken, for the purposes of

                            information at any time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision effectively exonerates the relevant party against the
                    application of s 44 once that party discharges its obligation under
                    s 39 to make a Suspicious Transaction Report. There is no dispute here that
                    WBL lodged a Suspicious Transaction Report in respect of the Transaction on
                    17 July 2007 (see above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>)
                    pursuant to its obligation under s 39 of the CDSA. The application of
                    s 44 is therefore precluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the circumstances, it is not, strictly speaking, necessary for us to assess
                    the correctness of the reasoning of the Judge in the court below. However, given
                    the general significance of the various holdings in the court below, some
                    observations by this court might be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In so far as s 44(1) was concerned, WBL had argued in the court below
                    that, in allotting and issuing the Relevant Shares, (a) it would be
                    entering or into or otherwise concerned in an “arrangement” with
                    Lew; (b) with knowledge or reasonable grounds to believe that, by that
                    arrangement, Lew’s benefits of criminal conduct were being used for his
                    benefit to acquire the Relevant Shares and (c) with knowledge or reasonable
                    grounds to believe that Lew had engaged in “criminal conduct” or
                    had “benefited from criminal conduct”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Judge accepted WBL’s defence and held that all the three elements
                    set out in the preceding paragraph were made out on the facts. Her reasons for
                    her findings are as follows (see the Judgment at [22]–[29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    I accept WBL’s submission that it would have entered into an
                            “arrangement” with Lew by issuing the shares to Lew.
                            Lew’s argument was basically that an “arrangement”
                            within the meaning of the CDSA had to involve an <em>agreement</em> between the accused person and the
                            perpetrators of criminal conduct. It is noted that the term
                            “arrangement” has been “frequently used in statute
                            to describe the widest possible class of action in a particular
                            context” (see <em>Jowitt’s Dictionary of
                                English Law</em> vol 1 (Greenberg gen ed)
                            (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) at p 159). If
                            Parliament had intended only for agreements to be caught, it would have
                            used express words to that effect. In any case, if WBL was to issue
                            those shares to Lew, there would have been an agreement between the two.
                            I therefore take the view that the first element had been made
                            out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    Lew did not dispute that WBL knew that he had used the proceeds from
                            the Insider Trade to fund the exercise of his share options. WBL also
                            knew that Lew was in possession of information that was not generally
                            available at the time of the Insider Trade. As such, if the proceeds Lew
                            received from the Insider Trade were his “benefits from criminal
                            conduct”, …. the second element would be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    In respect of the third element, Lew argued that the Insider Trade was
                            not criminal conduct within the meaning of the CDSA. Lew highlighted
                            that he was sued by MAS in a <em>civil</em> action
                            (for payment of a civil penalty under s 232 of the SFA) and was
                            never <em>charged</em> under s 221 for an
                            offence. Under s 2 of the CDSA, “criminal conduct” is
                            defined as doing or being concerned in a “serious
                            offence”. In turn, a serious offence is defined any of the
                            predicate offences set out in Schedule 2 of the CDSA (“the
                            List”). The List provides that “Section 221 for
                            contravention of s 218” is a serious offence. However, the
                            List does not refer to an action brought under s 232 read with
                            s 218 of the SFA as a serious offence. As a result, Lew contended
                            that since MAS had chosen to proceed under s 232 of the SFA, WBL
                            could not maintain that he <em>could</em> have been
                            punished under s 221 of the SFA. WBL’s response was that
                            there was no requirement for the perpetrator to be charged before it can
                            amount to a “serious offence”, and whether there was a
                            “serious offence” would depend on whether an offence had
                            been <em>committed</em> instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    I agree with WBL’s submissions. The objectives of the CDSA would
                            be defeated if the perpetrator needs to be charged before the CDSA
                            provisions can apply. It would allow a person to knowingly deal with the
                            tainted property of a criminal until he is charged. I cannot accept that
                            the Parliament could have intended for a person who assists a criminal,
                            who is successful in evading arrest from the authorities and is never
                            charged for the predicate offence, to fall outside the purview of
                            s 44(1) of the CDSA. Notably, s 44(1) merely requires a person
                            to know or have reasonable grounds to believe that the other person is
                            engaging or has <em>engaged</em> in criminal
                            conduct. It does not provide that a person must know or have reasonable
                            grounds to believe that the other person has been <em>charged</em> for criminal conduct. In my view, where a person
                            knows or has reason to believe that another person has committed an
                            offence, it would fall squarely within the purview of s 44(1), and
                            that person could be liable for assisting the other person in money
                            laundering if the other elements are made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The present case is unique, as a person who infringes the rules
                            prohibiting insider trading under the SFA can face either civil or
                            criminal proceedings. This is distinguishable from the other offences
                            which attract criminal consequences only. On 9 July 2007, when Lew
                            exercised the two share options, it would not have been possible for WBL
                            or even Lew himself to know if he would be charged for criminal insider
                            trading or sued for payment of a civil penalty instead. However, given
                            the present circumstances, WBL knew that Lew had sold shares while in
                            possession of material non-public information. It would, at the very
                            least, have had reasonable grounds to believe that Lew had committed an
                            offence and could be punished under s 221 of the SFA. In those
                            circumstances, I am of the view that WBL would (at least) have
                            reasonable grounds to believe that Lew had engaged in criminal conduct
                            within the meaning of the CDSA. If, however, the issue relating to these
                            share options were to arise today (<em>ie</em>,
                            after Lew has been found liable by this court for the payment of a civil
                            penalty under s 232 of the SFA), it would not be possible to
                            classify the money that Lew received from the Insider Trade as being the
                            benefits of his criminal conduct, since s 221(2) of the SFA
                            provides that no criminal proceedings can be instituted against him once
                            the court has ordered him to pay a civil penalty under s 232 of the
                            SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    Another point raised by Lew was that the quantum of the
                            “benefits of criminal conduct” should be assessed with
                            reference to s 8 of the CDSA, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    Lew took the position that under s 8 of the CDSA, his benefits

                            explained to the court’s satisfaction, were limited to the $27,000
                            loss that he avoided from the Insider Trade. WBL however maintained that
                            the benefits of Lew’s criminal conduct were the entire $446,773.26
                            he received from the Insider Trade. Even if the benefits were limited to
                            the $27,000 loss that Lew avoided, WBL argued that an offence under
                            s 44(1) of the CDSA would likewise be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    I accept WBL’s submission. Notably, s 44(2) of the CDSA
                            states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In this section, references to any person’s benefits from
                            criminal conduct include a reference to any property which, <em>in whole or in part</em>, directly or indirectly,
                            represented in his hands his benefits from criminal conduct. [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In turn, s 2 of the CDSA defines property as including
                        “money”. It is not disputed that the money received from the
                        Insider Trade was used by Lew to fund the exercise of share options. As
                        such, at least a part of the money which WBL received for the exercise of
                        the share options represented Lew’s benefits from criminal conduct,
                        whether such benefits referred to the entire $446,773.26 proceeds he
                        received or the $27,000 loss he avoided. As a result, I find that Lew had
                        used his benefits from criminal conduct to exercise the two share options on
                        9 July 2007. I would therefore hold that WBL has satisfied the third
                        element of the offence under s 44(1) of the CDSA. Therefore, it would
                        have been illegal for WBL to have allotted and issued its shares to Lew on
                        9 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Having decided that s 44(1) rendered it illegal for WBL to issue the
                    Relevant Shares on 9 July 2007, the Judge went to hold (as noted above)
                    that s 44(3) of the CDSA (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) provided an avenue for WBL to issue the Relevant Shares
                    legally, and given that, under cl 8(b) of the ESOS, WBL had a contractual
                    obligation to seek “such consents or other required action of any
                    competent authority under [any] regulations or enactments… as may be
                    necessary”, WBL should apply to the Commercial Affairs Department for its
                    consent to issue the Relevant Shares. She accordingly directed WBL to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Turning, first, to the Judge’s reasoning in relation to s 44(1) (as
                    set out above at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>), the first reason
                    given by the Judge for accepting WBL’s submission that the latter would
                    have committed an offence under s 44(1) had it issued the Relevant Shares
                    to Lew was that the word “arrangement” had a wide meaning and did
                    not necessarily require an agreement between the parties to do the act
                    contemplated. If an agreement were required, Parliament would have said so. In
                    any case, the issue of the Relevant Shares by WBL would, by itself, have
                    constituted an agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Counsel for WBL has drawn our attention to two decisions on similar
                    legislation in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong where an English court and Hong
                    Kong court have given a wide meaning to the words “enters into or is
                    otherwise concerned in an arrangement” having the effect of assisting a
                    person to use the benefits of his criminal conduct to acquire property by way of
                    investment. In the English High Court decision of <em>Lars
                        </em><em>Wester v Euan Cecil Santhagens
                        </em><em>Borland</em> [2007] EWHC 2484,
                    Norris J observed as follows ([23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second line of Defence related to the trustee’s concerns that he
                        was exposed to liability under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The provisions of
                        this far-reaching statute are sufficiently familiar for me simply to
                        summarise them. By section 328, a person commits an offence if he becomes
                        concerned in an arrangement which he suspects will facilitate the use of
                        criminal property by another person. A transfer of the money in the Swiss
                        bank account by the Defendant to the Claimant would be such an arrangement.
                        That would depend upon the contents of the Swiss bank account being criminal
                        property. “Criminal property” is defined in section 340 of the
                        Act as “property which constitutes a person's benefit from criminal
                        conduct”, “criminal conduct” being defined as
                        “conduct which constitutes an offence in any part of the United
                        Kingdom or would constitute an offence if it occurred there”. The
                        only relevant offence could be an offence under New Zealand law for wrongly
                        claiming off-set relief on the grounds that legal ownership of the 49%
                        shareholding did not suffice as a foundation for the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>The Queen v Lo Chak Man and Tsoi </em><em>Sau </em><em>Ngai</em> [1996] HKCU 172,
                    the Hong Kong Court of Appeal held that the words “a person who enters
                    into or is otherwise concerned in an arrangement” in s 25 of the
                    Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance (“HK/DT(RP)”)
                    which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…a person who enters into or is otherwise concerned in an
                        arrangement whereby …the retention or control by or on behalf of
                        another (‘the relevant person’) of the relevant person’s
                        proceeds of drug trafficking is facilitated…knowing or having
                        reasonable grounds to believe that the relevant person … has
                        benefitted from the drug trafficking, commits an offence[;]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">are wide enough to apply to the conscious act of “uplifting” on
                    four occasions the money in the relevant person’s bank account if that
                    person has knowledge that it will facilitate the relevant person’s control
                    of the proceeds of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Accordingly, we agree with the Judge that the first element of s 44(1)
                    was satisfied in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The second reason for accepting WBL’s defence pursuant to s 44(1)
                    was that the proceeds Lew received from the Insider Trade were his
                    “benefits from criminal conduct”, which were $446,773.26, and not
                    $27,000 (being the amount of loss avoided (see <em>Monetary
                        Authority of Singapore v Lew Chee Fai Kevin</em> [2010]
                    4 SLR 209 at [131]). The Judge relied on s 44(2) to justify this
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With respect, we disagree with this reasoning. The CDSA is an anti-money
                    laundering statute. Its principal object is to prevent ill-gotten gains from
                    being laundered into other property so as to avoid detection and confiscation by
                    the enforcement agencies. The “benefits” in the present case were
                    $27,000 which was the loss avoided by Lew as a result of his insider trades in
                    WBL shares. The Judge, with respect, misconstrued s 44(2) as a reference to
                    the proceeds of criminal conduct (<em>ie</em>, $446,773.26)
                    when it actually refers to “property which … in whole or in part
                    … represented in his hands his benefits from criminal conduct.”
                    What these words mean, in the context of this case, is that if WBL has issued
                    the Relevant Shares at the price of $485,110, only $27,000 out of $485,110 would
                    be “benefits” from criminal conduct. Section 44(1) of the
                    CDSA is very specific. It targets the “benefits” from criminal
                    conduct, not “the proceeds from criminal conduct” (<em>cf </em><em>s </em>43 of the CDSA
                    and s 25 of the HK/DT(RP) which refers to “proceeds of drug
                    trafficking”). For these reasons, s 44(1) applies to WBL only with
                    respect to the $27,000, being Lew’s benefits from insider trading, and
                    therefore WBL was not justified in refusing to issue the Relevant Shares less
                    the number to the value of $27,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The third reason relied upon by the Judge in the court below to the effect
                    that Lew’s insider trading was criminal conduct was also, with respect,
                    flawed. The expression “criminal conduct” is defined in
                    s 2(1) of the CDSA principally as “a serious offence (other than an
                    offence under section 44 or 47)”. The definition of “serious
                    offence” refers to the offences specified in the Second Schedule of the
                    CDSA. Under Pt III of the Second Schedule, a “serious
                    offence” in the context of insider trading under the SFA is not defined
                    as “Section 218”
                    <em>per se</em>, but is, instead, defined as
                    “Section 221 for contravention of section 218”. In the
                    present case, the Public Prosecutor did not prosecute Lew for an offence under
                    s 218. Instead, the Public Prosecutor permitted MAS to pursue a civil claim
                    against Lew for insider trading. The Judge mistakenly assumed that it was
                    sufficient without more for WBL to plead that such a predicate offence had been
                    committed. With respect, we cannot agree with this (see <em>Ang
                        Jeanette v PP</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1 at [57] and [58]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the circumstances, therefore, quite apart from the legal effect of
                    s 40 of the CDSA on the facts of the present case (see above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>), it could not, in any event, be said that
                    s 44(1) would have applied in the context of the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is another aspect of the Judge’s reasoning in the court below
                    which is, with respect, unsatisfactory. This relates to her decision on the
                    applicability of s 44(3) (that WBL was obliged to seek CAD’s consent
                    under the subsection to issue the Relevant Shares to Lew).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As we have mentioned earlier, the Judge directed WBL to seek the consent of
                    CAD to issue the Relevant Shares to Lew. This direction was given on the basis
                    that WBL had a contractual duty to obtain consent from “any competent
                    authorities” under cl 8(b) of the ESOS (see above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>), and this extended to seeking the consent of
                    the relevant authorities under s 44(3) of the CDSA for the Relevant Shares
                    to be issued to Lew (Judgment at [34]).
                    The Judge reasoned (at [34] of the
                    Judgment) that “[q]uite plainly, the ESOS contemplated the situation
                    whereby WBL would need to obtain the consent of <em>any of the
                        authorities</em> before it could issue shares” [emphasis
                    added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In our view, this reasoning is, with respect, wrong because the parties would
                    hardly have contemplated an <em>illegal</em> performance of
                    WBL’s contractual obligations to Lew under the ESOS. In reality, they
                    would not have contemplated that at all. Furthermore, under the ESOS, WBL did
                    not have any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to obtain any permission from
                    CAD or the competent authority under the CDSA to issue the Relevant Shares. As
                    far as Lew was concerned, WBL had an obligation to issue the Relevant Shares to
                    him unless it was contrary to law. If the issue of the Relevant Shares was
                    contrary to law, the question of WBL having a continuing duty to issue the
                    Relevant Shares, for example, by seeking the consent of the relevant authorities
                    (if applicable in the present case) would not arise. WBL has no obligation to
                    remedy an illegal act on the part of Lew.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illegality under section 47 of the CDSA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We consider next WBL’s argument that s 47 of the CDSA made it
                    illegal for Lew to convert his monies, which included the proceeds from the
                    insider trading transaction, through the Options into WBL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Section 47(1) renders a person guilty of an offence if he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    conceals or disguises any property which is, or in whole or in part,
                            directly or indirectly, represents, his benefits from criminal conduct;
                            [or]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    converts or transfers that property or removes it from the
                            jurisdiction …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Section 47(1) criminalises what is known as “primary”
                    money-laundering, <em>ie</em>, a defendant’s
                    laundering of the proceeds of his <em>own</em> crime. In
                    comparison, s 47(2), which is not applicable in the present case,
                    criminalises “secondary” money-laundering, <em>ie</em>, a defendant’s laundering of the proceeds of someone
                    else’s crime. Section 47(2), prior to its amendment in 2010, reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any
                        property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents,
                        another person’s benefits from criminal conduct—</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    conceals or disguises that property; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    converts or transfers that property or removes it from the
                                jurisdiction,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">for the purpose of assisting any person to avoid prosecution for a serious
                        offence or a foreign serious offence or the making or enforcement of a
                        confiscation order shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Only s 47(1) is relevant here, in particular, s 47(1)(<em>b</em>), which we now turn to consider. This provision is
                    directed against illegality <em>on the part of Lew</em> and
                    not on the part of WBL as it would have been under s 44(1) had s 44(1)
                    been applicable (see above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>).
                    Nevertheless, s 47(1) illegality is still relevant for the purposes of
                    determining whether WBL is obliged to perform its contractual obligations to Lew
                    under the ESOS. Performance of a contract is illegal if it would be illegal for
                        <em>either</em> party to perform because the contract
                    itself is prohibited, and the innocent party is entitled to refuse performance
                    on that basis even if performance would be <em>legal
                        </em><em>on its part</em> (see the leading
                    English decision of <em>Re Mahmoud and Ispahani</em> [1921]
                    2 KB 716). In this regard, an important threshold issue is whether or
                    not there was any criminal conduct in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there any criminal conduct on the part of Lew?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For the reasons set out above (at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>),
                    we are of the view that Lew’s conduct cannot be characterised as criminal
                    conduct for the purposes of s 47 of the CDSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In conclusion, WBL’s argument that its contractual obligation to issue
                    the Relevant Shares to Lew was extinguished <em>because the
                        performance of this contractual obligation would have been illegal under
                        </em><em>s 44 or </em><em>s 47 of the CDSA</em> is clearly wrong. In so far as WBL’s
                    defence of common law illegality is concerned, WBL must prove that Lew’s
                    claim for specific performance of its contractual obligation under the ESOS to
                    issue the Relevant Shares is <em>premised upon</em> an
                    illegality. As explained above, there was no illegality to begin with and,
                    hence, this defence fails. Therefore, WBL remains under a contractual obligation
                    under the ESOS to issue the Relevant Shares. It follows from this finding that
                    WBL was in breach of contract for failing to issue the Relevant Shares to Lew in
                    accordance with the terms of the ESOS. The next question is what damages are Lew
                    entitled to, since the Relevant Shares have yet to be issued to Lew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>What damages are Lew entitled to?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The facts relevant to this issue are as follows: (a) Lew exercised two
                    options on 9 July 2007 pursuant to cl 8(a) of the ESOS for the
                    Relevant Shares to be issued to him pursuant to the options granted on,
                    respectively, 21 January 2000 and 6 February 2004 (“the
                    Options”); and (b) WBL was under an obligation to issue the Relevant
                    Shares within 10 Market Days (ie, by 19 July 2007) from the date of
                    the exercise of the two option, but has failed to do so on the ground (now
                    proven to be erroneous) that it was contrary to law to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The unusual feature in the present case is that at the time when WBL raised
                    the issue of illegality, it was not certain whether as a matter of law
                    Lew’s insider trading was or was not contrary to law as the matter was
                    still under investigation by the relevant authorities. Once MAS instituted the
                    civil proceedings against Lew on 19 November 2008, WBL’s defence of
                    illegality was extinguished (unless it applied for a fiat to prosecute Lew for
                    the offence of insider trading).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The question that arises is whether in these circumstances WBL could argue
                    that it was not in breach of its contractual obligation under the ESOS until
                    19 November 2008. In our view, the answer is in the negative. Under
                    Condition 19 of the ESOS, WBL must issue the Relevant Shares by
                    19 July 2007. The fact that it had a potential defence of illegality does
                    not postpone the time of performance. It does not matter that the illegality
                    relied upon whether or not the Public Prosecutor decided to charge Lew for the
                    offence of insider trading. The decision of the Public Prosecutor is irrelevant
                    to the contractual obligations of WBL. The point can be easily appreciated if
                    one were simply to imagine the Public Prosecutor prosecuting Lew for insider
                    trading and failing to prove a case against him. There is no defence of
                    “wait and see” in the performance of a contractual obligation
                    unless it has been expressly provided for in the contract. Having elected to
                    withhold performance of its contractual obligations on the basis of illegality,
                    WBL took the risk of this basis being proven untrue. Indeed, there would have
                    been no prejudice to WBL <em>even if</em> it had issued the
                    Relevant Shares and it subsequently turned out that there <em>was</em> illegality. As we explained above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>, any illegality on WBL’s part
                        (<em>ie</em>, under s 44(1)) was precluded once it
                    had made a Suspicious Transaction Report. Any illegality arising from the issue
                    of the Relevant Shares could only have been under s 47, <em>ie</em>, on Lew’s part, in the event that Lew was later
                    convicted for insider trading. In such a scenario, however, it would have been
                    for the Public Prosecutor in his discretion to follow up on the consequences of
                    Lew’s criminal conduct, for example by applying for an order to confiscate
                    Lew’s benefits of criminal conduct under Part II of the CDSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In our view, WBL was in breach of contract in failing to issue the Relevant
                    Shares to Lew on 19 July 2007. In the circumstances, should Lew decide to
                    pursue the matter, he would be entitled to damages which he is able to prove
                    (and which are to be assessed by the Registrar) – subject, of course, to
                    the relevant legal principles such as remoteness and mitigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     For the above reasons, we allow WBL’s appeal in CA 149 in part
                        (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>–<a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above) and also allow Lew’s appeal in
                    CA 150 (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), in both
                    cases, with the usual consequential orders. We also dismiss WBL’s appeal
                    against the Judge’s costs order below as that costs order was, in our
                    view, fair given the arguments proffered in the proceedings below. In the
                    circumstances, we find it appropriate to make no order as to the costs of the
                    appeals.</p>
