<p align="justify">Background</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">1. The nature of the dispute before me arose from a settlement agreement reached

between the parties in the consolidated Companies Winding Up Petition 162 of 1996 and Originating

Summons 727 of 1996. The parties in the consolidated matters may be categorized into three groups.

The plaintiffs are members of the Bajumi family from Indonesia. The second to fifth defendants are

members of the Tan family from Singapore. The first defendant is a company (the "Company")

in which the Bajumi and Tan families own or control equal shares. Essentially, the Company has three

principal assets. First, a major block of shares in Ssangyong Corporation Ltd, secondly, the

leasehold interest in the building known as the Afro-Asia Building, and thirdly, a rubber plantation

in Sumatra, Indonesia. The Company was founded by the patriarchs of the two families many years ago.

The families now no longer share a common vision for the company and that gave rise to disputes

which culminated in the two consolidated actions. On the date of the trial of the actions, namely 14

April 1998, the parties appeared by counsel to record a settlement in which the general intention

was that the Bajumis from Indonesia would keep the Indonesian assets and the Tan family would take

the Singapore assets (comprising the Ssangyong shares and the Afro-Asia Building). This necessitated

a valuation of the assets for the purpose of one party buying over the others share. The parties

were unable to agree as to how the order of court was to be carried out and that led their return to

the court on 10 November 1998 to vary the orders of 14 April 1998. The original orders and

subsequent variations were all made by consent. Consequently, both sides adduced valuation reports

of the three assets that were so far apart that the dispute concerning the values of the three

principal assets had to be resolved by this court.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In these proceedings the parties had, by consent, nominated three assessors

(as independent assessors) to assist me in respect of each of the assets. Mr. Sajjad Akhtar

(assisted by Mr. Andrew Grimmett) of Arthur Andersen, was appointed as assessor in respect of the

valuation of the Ssangyong shares, and as co-assessor together with Dr. Chee Kheng Hoy of Lyman

Agro, in respect of the valuation of the rubber plantation. Mr. Philip Leow (assisted by Ms Chiah

Soo Ling) of Debenham Tie Leung, was appointed in respect of the valuation of Afro-Asia Building.

The assessors are all highly qualified experts in their field, and I will say at the outset that

they had discharged their duty and function most professionally and impartially; and I record the

courts indebtedness to them especially for the immense amount of work they had so diligently put

in, and in easing my way through the work of the valuation experts - work which is at times

scientific and at times artistic.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Before I dwell on the valuations individually, it is necessary to set out the

consent orders of 14 April and 10 November 1998. They are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">Order of Court dated 14 April 1998 </p>
<blockquote>

<i>
<p align="justify">The Ssangyong Shares</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">4. The Company holds 17.4 million shares in Ssangyong Cement Singapore Ltd. The

issue between the parties lie in their disagreement over the agreed terms of settlement (as varied).

The Bajumi family take the view that the consent order required the parties to produce a fair value

of the shares by reference to the six dates specified in the variation order; and by this they

understand to mean calculating the fair value by ascertaining the market value of the shares on the

six dates and then deriving the average value. The Tan family, on the other hand, emphasized that

the consent order requires the six dates to be taken into account only if that was possible. Counsel

for the Tan family, Mr. Wong Meng Meng SC, submitted that it was impossible to have a fair value of

the shares with reference to six different dates. He submitted that the expert valuer must first

determine the appropriate method for valuing the shares before proceeding to take into account the

specifics such as the reference to the six dates. In short, his submission was that fair value ought

not be interpreted as "market value". Consequently, Mr. Wong submitted that the

"dividend yield" method used by his expert (Mr. Chan Ket Teck) was the correct approach.

Mr. Chan was of the view that the rival approach (that of Dr. Low) is maintainable only if a huge

discount of 40% is made to off-set the illiquidity of having 17.4 million shares on the market. Mr.

Wong had a further criticism of using market price as an indicia for fair value. He said that even

Dr. Low admitted that there were "wide fluctuations" in the price and that reflected a

substantial price volatility. Mr. Chans dividend yield method based on a dividend yield of 10.44%

thus produced the value of $17,922,000 or $1.03 a share. Dr. Lows method produced $64,140,605 or

$3.69 a share. He also gave an alternative calculation with a weighted average which produced

$63,853,024 or $3.67 a share. On the other hand, Dr. Low had two criticisms of the dividend yield

method. First, he said that companies have in recent times been more reluctant to pay dividends; and

secondly, that it is the desire for capital gains and not dividends that actuates investors.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It was not disputed that there is more than one way of evaluating the fair

value of shares in a public company. No specific method was agreed between the parties save that in

calculating the fair value, reference must be made to the six dates selected by the parties if

possible. No reasons were given as to why these six dates were important. The question is, whether

it is possible to assess the fair value of the shares "with reference to the six dates".

Dr. Low testified that he had no difficulty understanding the consent order and was able to evaluate

the fair value of the shares with reference to the six dates.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The first issue I have to determine, therefore, is whether it is possible to

calculate the fair value of the shares with reference to the six dates. This term was included as

part of the consent order so it must reasonably be assumed that the six dates are of some importance

to the parties one way or the other. However, the defendants object to the disclosure of the

significance of the six dates, and in this regard, they may have a valid point. They say that

various events took place over those dates and these are highly contentious matters. Thus, the

compromise reached in their agreed formula for division was to calculate the fair value of the

shares not on any one of the dates (as should ordinarily be the case), but to do so with regard to

all six dates. Although the defendants expert, Mr. Chan, was of the view that it was not possible

to take the six dates into account, but if he was compelled to do so, he could do it, but only after

factoring a 40% discount in the final result. This was necessitated by the illiquidity of the stock.

No basis was given as to how he arrived at the rate of 40% although I will accept that such an

exercise is largely arbitrary. I am of the view that a flat rate of 40% applied to the final result

may be excessive. Applying, strictly, the dividend yield method over the period 1995 to 1997, Mr.

Chan arrived at the value of S$17.904 million, rounded to S$1.03 a share. Dr. Low the plaintiffs

expert, on the other hand, had no problems with the method proposed in the consent order. He took

the market value of the shares and averaged them, after assigning various weights to the individual

six dates, to arrive at his figure of S$62.614 million. Dr. Low took the subjective (and thus

disputed) significance of the six dates (using information supplied by the clients) in calculating

the weight to be assigned to those dates. I have no hesitation in finding that this would be wrong.

However, Dr. Low had also proposed a simple, unweighted average of the market values of the shares

over those six dates and he arrived at S$58.5445 million, rounded up to S$3.34 a share. He had to

apply a volume-weighted share price for each of the six months as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">October 1994 - S$5.41</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7. I am of the view that this alternative method of Dr. Low is preferable to Mr.

Chans. The consent order of court requires the parties to have regard to the six dates, but since

no information is supplied in respect of the significance of the six dates, no special weight need

be given to any of them, but they should not be ignored. Although the dividend yield method is an

acceptable method of calculating the fair value of a companys shares, there are some negative

aspects to this method. One of which is that many modern companies do not declare dividends in order

to allocate the funds to other beneficial use. It appears that such was the case in respect of the

company in question. Secondly, once the parties agree to calculate the fair value with reference to

six dates, the overly flexible nature of the dividend yield method will have to be applied six times

over, thereby exaggerating any inaccuracy in the process. Where the market value is freely available

it is certainly reasonable to use that as a guide unless there are sufficiently compelling reasons

against its use. In this case, I have no difficulty in applying the market values over the six

dates. I have no difficulty with the volume weighted price for each of the six months. The opposing

experts held widely differing views as to how much discount ought to be given to take into account

the liquidity (or lack of it) when such a large block of shares is put on the open market. However,

neither had considered the counter-balance of the power of control that the holder of this block of

shares can wield. Taking these factors into account, and accepting that the actual discount rate is

to a large extent arbitrary, I find that the fair value of the Ssangyong shares to be S$3.34 a share

(or S$58,110,000.00).</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The Afro-Asia Building</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">8. The agreement in respect of the valuation of the Afro-Asia Building was

similar in principle to that concerning the Ssangyong shares. The only difference was that instead

of having reference to six dates, the parties agreed to refer to four dates, as Mr. Wong quickly

pointed out, "if possible". The dispute involved not only the question whether it was

possible to have regard to the four dates in the valuation, but whether the valuation ought to be

made with regard to the full potential of the building. The four dates stipulated under the consent

order were October 1994, August 1995, July 1996, and April 1998. The expert valuer for the Bajumis

family was Ms. Lydia Sng from the Knight Frank Pte Ltd. Ms. Sng adopted the comparable sales method

as well as the residual land value method as the basis for her valuation, with each being used as

"a check against the other". The market value as at each of these dates was $59,520,000,

$74,120,000, $75,259,000, $56,150,000 respectively. The expert for the Tan family was Mr. Li Hiaw Ho

from CB Richard Ellis Pte Ltd. He produced the valuation of the building as at April 1998 only and

his valuation was $37,110,000. It will be seen at once that the valuations of Mr. Li and Ms. Sng

differ substantially in respect of the April 1998 date alone.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Apart from the critical difference of Mr. Lis single date valuation and Ms

Sngs four-date valuation, there was another important difference in the two approaches, namely

that Mr. Li disregarded the full potential of the building whereas Ms. Sng took that into account in

her valuation of 8 March 2000. That was the valuation put forward at trial and will be the one I

would use to determine the strength of the plaintiffs case. It will be seen that the valuation of

the Afro-Asia Building requires more art than the valuation of the Ssangyong shares although market

value forms the backbone of the valuation in both instances. In the latter case, the market value

was, in fact, a comparative market value and not the market value of the building itself as it was

not put up for sale at the material times. For the same reasons as I have set out in respect of the

Ssangyong shares, I am of the view that the single date valuation is not the correct approach. The

parties had agreed to value the property according to the fair value, if possible, by reference to

the market values of the building on the four dates they agreed upon and I am not persuaded that

this would be impossible to do.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Mr. Li assessed the building in its existing state as at 14 April 1998 as

S$37,000,000.00 (or about S$600 per square foot). This was on the basis that the development charge

(or differential premium) is paid off. Mr. Li takes the value on the basis of the 53 years remainder

of the 99-year lease. In my view, it is not reasonable to exclude the potential of the building in

evaluating its fair value. In this case, there are two potential factors. First, the owner may

top-up the lease to bring it back to a full 99-year lease, and secondly, to re-develop building. He

might do either or both. Taking the potential into account is more difficult than it seems because

it is a subjective appraisement. The new owner may decide that he would do neither. In this case,

taking the existing condition of the building and the length of the remaining lease, it appears to

me that a potential buyer will look towards redevelopment rather than be content to harvest the

fruit of the planted tree until the end of the trees natural life. In this regard, I am of the

view that Ms Sngs valuation of 8 March 2000 to be the more appropriate and reasonable of the two.

Her valuation based on the average of the four dates is S$66,260,000.00. The court assessor, Mr.

Leow, is in full agreement, but he cautioned that Ms Sngs valuation is ostensibly flawed in one

respect, namely that she had not taken the holding cost on the differential land premium into

account. Hence, the estimated differential land premium must be deducted at the end of the

computation for each of the four years. If that is taken into account, the valuation of Ms Sng will

be adjusted to S$57,625,000.00. The courts assessor, Mr. Leow would have done a few things

differently from the two opposing experts, but acknowledging the highly subjective nature of this

exercise, he accepts my view that there should be no interference other than the one above. I,

therefore, find that the fair value of the Afro-Asia Building to be S$57,625,000.00.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The Rubber Plantation In Indonesia</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">11. If the valuation of property is more art than science, the valuation of a

rubber plantation borders on fortune-telling. Given the expertise of the two protagonist experts,

Mr. Fernandez (for the Bajumis) and Dr. Wijesekera, the difference in their respective assessment

was vast. Mr. Fernandez calculated the value to be US$3.5 million whereas Dr. Wijesekeras

calculations came to US$66 million. The difficulties of valuing the plantation are manifold. First,

there are various methodologies that may be used for the valuation. In this case, however, both

experts had used the discounted cash flow method. Even so, deep discrepancies opened up between them

over the factors to be taken into account, and also the individual assessment of each of these

factors vary greatly. For example, Mr. Fernandez used a discount factor of 20% whereas Dr.

Wijesekara used a discount factor of 10%. Secondly, the quality of trees planted, the

infra-structure of the land, the quality of rubber produced and manufactured, planting and

production costs, and the future demand and price of rubber have all to be taken into account.

Plantations differ also in the manner in which they are run, and in this regard, those in Sri Lanka

are acknowledged to be among some of the better run ones in the world. To complete the picture,

however, I find that the plantation in question appears to be a well managed one. The wide, well

tarred roads within the plantation shown in the photographs produced at trial also give a fairly

clear picture of this impression.</p>
<p align="justify">12. The first duty of the court is to satisfy itself that the person put forward

as an expert in his field is indeed one. In this case, Mr. Fernandez and Dr. Wijesekera each holds

an impressive list of paper certification and experience. I need not recite the list save to say

that their paper credentials were not challenged. Mr. Wong made a vigorous submission that Mr.

Fernandez had "disqualified himself as an expert", but I am unable to agree with that

view. I think that Mr. Fernandezs words that he did not think himself an expert was taken out of

context. He clearly meant that he was not an accountant by training as Dr. Wijesekara is. Mr.

Fernandez is an expert in estate valuation with particular experience in the valuation of rubber

plantations in Malaysia. Dr. Wijesekera is a chartered accountant by training, but has experience in

the valuation of rubber plantations in Sri Lanka. The experts competency is, naturally, enhanced

by the quantity and quality of his research, and the study he undertakes. There is no special

category of expert known as the "valuation expert on rubber plantations". The persons

appointed to assist the court is a team consisting of an agronomist and an accountant. There are,

therefore, many routes to qualify as an expert in the valuation of rubber plantations, and I have no

difficulty in accepting Mr. Fernandez and Mr. Wijesekara as experts in this field although they each

have their strengths and weaknesses. While Mr. Fernandez is familiar with the state of rubber

plantations and the rubber industry in Malaysia, Dr. Wijesekara is familiar with that in Sri Lanka.

There can be little doubt that the conditions of this industry vary greatly in different countries

and a sound knowledge of what goes on in the country in question is important. Intimate knowledge of

details such as the fact and effect of the presence of squatters in the vicinity of the plantation

affect the valuation of yield, for instance. Mr. Fernandez had made a site inspection of the

plantation in question but Dr. Wijesekara did not. Quite apart from the individual mannerism, style,

and personality of the witness which, in varying degree, may add to or detract from the overall

confidence the court may repose in his testimony, the substance and quality of an experts

evidence is best approached with the summary of the duties and responsibilities of an expert, as set

out by Cresswell J in the <i>Ikarian Reefer</i> [1993] 2 Lloyds rep 68, 81, firmly and constantly

in mind. I will here set out the relevant portion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. Expert evidence presented to the Court should be, and should be seen

  to be, the independent product of the expert uninfluenced as to form or content by the exigencies

  of litigation (<i>Whitehouse v Jordan,</i> [1981] 1 WLR 246 at p. 256, per Lord Wilberforce).</p>
<p align="justify">2. An expert witness should provide independent assistance to the Court by way

  of objective unbiased opinion in relation to matters within his expertise (see <i>Polivitte Ltd v

  Commercial union Assurance Co. Plc.,</i> [1987] 1 Lloyds Rep. 379 at p. 386 per Mr. Justice

  Garland and <i>Re J</i>, <nobr>[1990] FCR 193</nobr> per Mr. Justice Cazalet). An expert witness in the High

  Court should never assume the role of an advocate.</p>
<p align="justify">3. An expert witness should state the facts or assumption upon which his

  opinion is based. He should not omit to consider material facts which could detract from his

  concluded opinion (<i>Re J</i> sup.).</p>
<p align="justify">4. An expert witness should make it clear when a particular question or issue

  falls outside his expertise.</p>
<p align="justify">5. If an experts opinion is not properly researched because he considers

  that insufficient data is available, then this must be stated with an indication that the opinion

  is no more than a provisional one (<i>Re J </i>sup.). In cases where an expert witness who has

  prepared a report could not assert that the report contained the truth, the whole truth and

  nothing but the truth without some qualification, that qualification should be stated in the

  report (<i>Derby &amp; Co Ltd and Others v Weldon and Others, The Times, </i>No. 9, 1990 per Lord

  Justice Staughton).</p>
<p align="justify">6. If, after exchange of reports, an expert witness changes his view on a

  material matter having read the other sides experts report or for any other reason, such

  change of view should be communicated (through legal representatives) to the other side without

  delay and when appropriate to the Court.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Where expert evidence refers to photographs, plans, calculations, analyses,

  measurements, survey reports or other similar documents, these must be provided to the opposite

  party at the same time as the exchange of reports (see 15.5 of the Guide to Commercial Court

  Practice)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">To these salutations, I need only add that in discharging his duty the expert is

required to make reasonable appraisement of reasonable factors. Often, he cannot be proved right;

and he must thus gain acceptance of his opinion by the depth of his research, the soundness of his

analysis and arguments, and the honesty and impartiality in which he presents his views.</p>
<p align="justify">13. The plantation in question is in Palembang, Sumatra. The clear evidence shows

that sometime in 1990 the parties (with PT Bumi Rambang Kramajaya) acquired a site of some 10,000

hectares of land for the purposes of establishing the plantation. However, according to Mr.

Fernandezs report, this portion of which I have no difficulty in accepting, only 2,133.22

hectares have been planted with rubber trees with varying ages of three to nine years. There is a

plantable reserve of 3,586.63 hectares. Roads and buildings take up 384.90 hectares; while 1,204.84

hectares is swampland; and 3,140.42 hectares were occupied by villagers.</p>
<p align="justify">14. The various factors that were considered by the parties experts are

individually assessable and I, therefore, considered each item to determine which of the two views,

if they differ, is the more reasonable. I then take into account the whole, and whether any factor

had been omitted or required adjustment. On that basis, I shall proceed as follows.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Date of Valuation</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">15. Dr. Wijesekera used April 1998, the date of the order of court, as the date

of valuation whereas Mr. Fernandez used March 2000, which was the date he commenced his valuation.

In the absence of any agreement or indication by the parties to the contrary, I am of the view that

the date of valuation ought to be the date of the order of court and find that the date for

valuation should be April 1998. Dr. Wijesekera took the period of valuation to be from 1990 to 2020

while Mr. Fernandez took the period as 1999 to 2029. In view of the lease granted to the plantation

to be 30 years, I am of the view that the proper period should be from 1990 to 2020. It is noted

that there is no dispute that the field was first planted in 1990 and the year of commencement of

production was 1996.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Production Costs</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">16. These would include the costs of tapping and collection; upkeep and

maintenance; and general charges. Dr. Wijesekera did not set out sufficiently all his detailed

assumptions in his report and evidence. Mr. Fernandez is of the opinion that the costs would be

Rp1,600 per kg; Rp300,000 per hectare; and Rp300,000 per hectare respectively. I am of the view that

the assessment of the costs of tapping and collection to be on the high side and will therefore

adjust the figure to Rp700,000 per hectare.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Capital Expenditure</p>
<p align="justify">(a) Factory, Building And Installation</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">17. Dr. Wijesekara presented figures from US$44,000 in 1990 to US$2.65 million in

2006 whereas Mr. Fernandez regarded the period from 1990 to 1994 as irrelevant for consideration,

and estimated Rp300 million for the period 2000 to 2004. In this regard, I am of the view that there

should be no relevance for the period 1990 to 1994 as capital for this period is part of sunk cost.

In respect of the period 2000 to 2004 I am content to accept Mr. Fernandezs assessment of Rp300

million.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(b) Transportation, Equipment, Roads, And Bridges</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">18. I agree with Mr. Fernandez that these costs are irrelevant for the period

1990 to 1997 as they are part of sunk cost, but some amount must be factored for the period 1998 to

2004 and in this regard, I am of the view that the figures estimated by Mr. Fernandez to be

reasonable.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(c) Land Licence Fee</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">19. I am of the view that the Land Licence Fee is not relevant for assessing the

fair value of the plantation as it is also a sunk cost in 1989/1990.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(d) Planting Cost And Planting Programme</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">20. Dr. Wijesekeras estimate so far as the planting cost is concerned from the

first to fifth year is not supported by sufficient details, and I am of the view that Mr. Fernandezs

estimate to be reasonable. So far as the cost of the planting programme from 1995 to 2008 is

concerned, I am of the view that Dr. Wijesekeras estimate to be a little high and, therefore, I

accept Mr. Fernandezs values in this regard.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Revenue</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">21. There is a great measure of arbitrariness when it comes to assessing the

revenue from the plantation. Insofar as the actual revenues were not available, I have used adjusted

World Bank figures. From the year 2006 to 2009, I have used the simple average from the year 2005 to

2010 World Bank prices. From 2011 to 2020 I have used the prices determined for the year 2010. The

rubber price in US Dollar per kg are set out in Appendix I to this judgment. The average yield per

hectare of planted area is set out in Appendix II to this judgment.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Working Capital</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">22. I have calculated the working capital simply by taking the average of the

figures used by Dr. Wijesekera (Mr. Fernandez did not provide any figures) as being the fairest in

the circumstances, and in the absence of hard evidence.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4">
<p align="justify"> </p>
</font><i>
<p align="justify">Residual Value</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">23. Dr. Wijesekara valued the trees at US$3 each in his assessment of the

residual value. Thus, on the assumption of 2.6m tress, he worked out the residual value as between

US$7 to US$8 million. After consultation with my assessors, I am of the view that this is grossly

excessive. Although Dr. Wijesekara may have adopted a "recognised formula" as Mr. Wong

submitted, but formulae are only feasibly applied if realistic figures are used. In this regard, I

am of the view that the residual value per tree shall be calculated as between US$0.50 to US$0.60

for 400 hectares of trees.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Discount Factor</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">24. This is by far the most significant factor. The discrepancy between Dr.

Wijesekeras 10% and Mr. Fernandezs 20% accounts for a large proportion of the difference in

valuation. Mr. Fernandez applied a discount rate of 10% to 15% in his valuations of Malaysian

plantations, but in his view, the financial and economic factors in Indonesia differ from the case

of plantations elsewhere. Each plantation must be assessed on its own. In his study, Mr. Fernandez

reported that a discount rate of 23% had been used in an Indonesian plantation. He had discussions

with other ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) based plantation valuation experts in

which the general opinion was that a discount rate of 20% to 25% is fair so far as Indonesian

plantations are concerned. I note Mr. Wongs objection and criticism especially when the other

experts are not available for cross-examination. However, it is accepted that an expert is entitled

to take into account what would otherwise be hearsay evidence because the nature of an experts

function necessarily prohibits any restraint on his research and methodology. In the end, it is the

testifying expert who must stand by his final report and be cross-examined on it. There is virtually

nothing in substance to support a discount rate of 10% in respect of a plantation in Indonesia. I am

more inclined towards Mr. Fernandezs assessment but 20% may just be on the extreme end. I will,

therefore, adjust the rate down to 17%. This discount is arrived at after taking into account the

potential of developing the estate into a world class plantation. This assumption has been made on

largely speculative factors such as the future production, costs, and revenue. The discount must

also reflect not only the track record but known uncertainties and circumstances, and the assumption

of marginal impact on prices. The subjectivity of applying the discount rate may itself be a cause

of concern to the potential investor, and that is something that cannot be ignored. I am of the view

that Dr. Wijesekeras rate was much too conservative while Mr. Fernandezs was just a little too

extravagant.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Size Of plantation</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">25. Ordinarily, the size of a plantation is purely a question of fact and is

answered easily enough. In this case, some confusion arose because there was no evidence of a proper

survey, and furthermore, some indirect and unsubstantiated evidence as to the possibility of

additional hectares being acquired. I accept the evidence of the Izin Lokasi letters issued by the

Indonesian government in determining the size of the plantation land. The size so determined is

about 10,450 hectares.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Fair Value</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">26. Having regard to all the above, I come to the finding that the fair value of

the plantation to be US$17.54 million, of which it must be noted that 40% belongs to the Company and

10% to Mr. Tan Choo Suan.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Costs</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">27. I will hear the parties on the question of costs at a later date if parties

are unable to agree costs between themselves.</p>
