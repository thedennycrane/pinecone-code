<p></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">1.    Soh Seng Hwee and Paw Ling Chiang Lina were

at one time husband and wife. On 16 September 1992, a Decree Nisi was granted to dissolve

the marriage. I understand that a Decree Absolute was made subsequently. However, for easy

reference, I will refer to Mr Soh as ‘the Husband’ and Mdm Paw as ‘the

Wife’. </font>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">2.    The parties had entered into a Deed of Settlement

dated 5 February 1988 i.e before the Decree Nisi was granted.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">3.    When the ancillaries came up for hearing, Judith

Prakash JC (as she then was) made an order, inter alia, that the Husband pay the Wife

maintenance of $5,000 per month in accordance with Clause 2(1) and (2) of the Deed. This

was on 29 July 1993.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">4.    In 1996, the Husband made an application to court.

One of the reliefs he sought was to reduce the maintenance to be paid to the Wife. On 10

April 1996, Justice T S Sinnathuray decided that there be no variation of the maintenance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.    The Husband has been in default from time to time

in paying maintenance to the Wife.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.    On 27 November 2001, the Wife applied by way

of Summons-in-Chambers No 602678 of 2001 for a lump sum maintenance instead. In her first

affidavit filed on 27 November 2001, she said there were material changes in

circumstances. In summary, she alleged her medical expenses had increased and this caused

her monthly expenses to increase. She also alleged that the income of the Husband, who is

a medical practitioner, had increased. She based this on a private investigator’s

report of the alleged number of patients being seen by the Husband in late 1999. She asked

for a lump sum of at least $350,000.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.    In her second affidavit filed on 17 April 2002, she

said that her application for a lump sum was prompted by the Husband’s irregular

payments. She also elaborated that she was 66 years old and the $350,000 was less than the

aggregate of six years’ monthly maintenance at $5,000 per month.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.    The Husband in turn filed an application by way of

Summons-in-Chambers No 600255 of 2002. In it, he sought again a reduction of the

maintenance to be paid to the Wife. He asked that it be reduced from $5,000 to $1,000 per

month. His alternative prayer was for a lump sum maintenance to be paid.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.    In his affidavit, he said that he was 68

years old. In summary, he listed various illness he was suffering from and asserted he

could stop work at any time. He also alleged that, contrary to the Wife’s assertion,

the income from his practice had been dropping and relied on his tax returns to establish

this. He also relied on his accountant to support this allegation as well as an alleged

net worth of less than $100,000 which included the value of his practice. He sought to

contrast this with the assets of the Wife. He also alleged that without the benefit of

legal advice, he did not know he could seek a variation of maintenance prior to his latest

application before me.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.    Although he had sought a lump sum maintenance, as

an alternative, he carefully avoided stating in his affidavits the lump sum he was

suggesting. When asked, his Counsel suggested $5,000 as the lump sum.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">11.    It seems to me that the real reason for the

Wife’s application for a lump sum is the Husband’s frequent defaults in paying

maintenance.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">12.    On the other hand, I am of the view that

the Husband has not been forthcoming about his income, and has deliberately made it out to

be much less than what he is actually earning. He has also exaggerated his poor health.

Both of these reasons had been used, among other reasons, in 1996 when he failed in his

application to reduce the maintenance to the Wife. In addition, I do not accept that he

did not know of his rights to apply for a variation of maintenance if there was a change

of circumstances, given his previous attempt to do so in 1996. It is clear to me that the

Husband’s late application to reduce the maintenance is his counter-attack in

response to the Wife’s application for a lump sum maintenance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">13.    As regards the question of a lump sum maintenance,

it is obvious to me that such a maintenance should, if possible, be ordered given the

history of defaults by the Husband. However, the Husband offered a lump sum maintenance of

only $5,000 through his Counsel. Even if the monthly maintenance had been reduced from

$5,000 per month to $1,000 per month, as the Husband had sought, the offer of $5,000 as a

lump sum was derisory. </font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">14.    On the other hand, the Wife was seeking

$350,000 as the lump sum. Even though I was minded to grant her something less, there was

insufficient evidence before me of the Husband’s assets and income to assist me in

making an order for a lump sum to be paid at one go, which sum would be very much in

excess of the $5,000 suggested by the Husband’s Counsel. On the one hand, I was

mindful to avoid making any order that the Husband could not meet and, on the other hand,

to avoid a result in which my caution might result in the Wife being short-changed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">15.    It is as much in the Husband’s interest to

pay a lump sum maintenance, if not more so. If the Husband is genuine about paying a lump

sum maintenance, he should offer a more realistic sum and/or make full disclosure of his

assets and income. He has not done either.</font></p>
