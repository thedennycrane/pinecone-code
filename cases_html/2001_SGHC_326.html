<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    The present suits (Suit No 1746 of 1999, Suit No 1748

of 1999, Suit No 1749 of 1999, Suit No 1750 of 1999, Suit No 1751 of 1999 and Suit No 1752 of 1999),

which were consolidated on 8 June 2001, involve claims by personal representatives and/or dependants

of persons who perished in an air crash near Palembang, Sumatra, on 19 December 1997. The

defendants, SilkAir (Singapore) Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as "SilkAir"), a

regional carrier, operated the aircraft which crashed. SilkAir contended that it is entitled to

limit its liability for the death of the passengers in accordance with the provisions of the Warsaw

Convention and the Warsaw Convention, as amended at The Hague in 1955 (hereinafter referred to as

the "amended Convention"). However, the plaintiffs claimed damages from SilkAir on the

basis that the question of limitation of liability under the Warsaw Convention and the amended

Convention does not arise in the circumstances of the case.

<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

A. BACKGROUND</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    On the afternoon of Friday, 19 December 1997, SilkAirs

Flight MI 185 took off from Jakartas Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at around 08:37:13

Co-ordinated Universal Time (hereinafter referred to as "UTC"), or 15:37:13 hours local

time, on a scheduled flight to Singapore. The aircraft, a brand new Boeing 737-300, bearing

registration number 9V TRF, had flown a little over 2,000 hours, all of which were in the service of

SilkAir. It was commanded by Captain Tsu Way Ming and his co-pilot was First Officer Duncan Ward

(hereinafter referred to as F/O Ward). There were 5 other crew members and 97 passengers on board

the aircraft.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    The weather over the intended route was generally fine, but

partly overcast. After leaving Jakarta, the aircraft received clearance from Jakarta Air Traffic

Control to climb to an altitude of 35,000 feet and to head directly to Palembang. At 09:10:26 UTC,

F/O Ward acknowledged a call from the air traffic controller, who had given instructions for the

cruising altitude to be maintained and for Singapore Air Traffic Control to be contacted at PARDI, a

reporting point north of Palembang, where responsibility for air traffic control is transferred to

Singapore. At 09:12:09 UTC, the radar readings indicated that the aircraft was still at its cruising

altitude of around 35,000 feet. The next radar return, some eight seconds later, revealed that the

aircraft was 400 feet below its cruising altitude and a rapid descent followed. The last recorded

radar data at 09:12:41 UTC showed that the aircraft was at an altitude of 19,500 feet. After that,

for unknown reasons, the aircraft disappeared from the radar screen. Its empennage broke up in

flight and it crashed into the Musi River delta, some 50 km away from Palembang. The crash occurred

in daylight and good weather conditions. No distress call had been received from Captain Tsu or F/O

Ward and no distress signal had been received from the aircrafts transponder. Furthermore, no

emergency locator beacon transmissions were detected near the crash site. The pilots, the crew and

all 97 passengers died in this tragic crash, the first in the history of SilkAir.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    In line with international practice, an investigation was

conducted in accordance with the standards and recommended practices of Annex 13 of the Chicago

Convention by the Indonesian National Transport Safety Committee (hereinafter referred to as

"NTSC"), formerly known as the Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission. Professor

Oetarjo Diran, the NTSCs chairman, led the investigation team. Among its members were accredited

representatives from the United States National Transport Safety Board (hereinafter referred to as

"NTSB") and Singapores Ministry of Communications. The sole objective of this

investigation was to prevent accidents and incidents and not to apportion blame or liability.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    Intensive salvage operations were carried out but work was

severely hampered as the wreckage of the aircraft, which was completely destroyed and fragmented on

impact with the Musi River, had penetrated deep into the river bottom. Furthermore, visibility in

the water was poor and there was a strong tidal current flow. Notwithstanding the adverse

conditions, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, often referred to as the

"black boxes", and small parts of the aircraft were retrieved from the crash site. The

parts which were recovered included a large portion of the wing structure, all actuators except for

one of the Krueger flap actuators, the two aileron power control units, aileron tab rods, several

pieces of aileron hinge fittings, the trailing edge flap transmissions and large fragments of the

left hand and right hand landing gear beams. In addition, parts of the rudder skin and the outboard

sections of the horizontal stabilizer were recovered on land, the furthest being about four

kilometres from the site of the main impact.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    The cockpit voice recorder (hereinafter referred to as the

"CVR") and the flight data recorder (hereinafter referred to as the "FDR"),

which record information about the flight, were sent to laboratories in Washington DC for analysis.

In its first interim report dated 25 March 1999, the NTSC disclosed that the aircrafts CVR and

FDR stopped recording several minutes before the crash.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    In its second interim report, which was released on 25

August 1999, the NTSC revealed that the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, which was recovered

from the crash site, had a nose-down trim which was different from the last known trim setting

before the FDR stopped recording. This meant that there could have been a manual input from the

cockpit which caused the aircraft to dive down very steeply. Although the NTSC stated that it had

not established who was responsible for the input, there was speculation that the aircraft may have

been deliberately crashed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    As a result of the NTSCs comments, Singapores

accredited representative lodged a police report on 25 August 1999. In view of this, the Criminal

Investigation Department (hereinafter referred to as "CID") formed a team to investigate

whether or not there was any indication of possible suicidal intent on the part of the pilot,

co-pilot or the crew. After an exhaustive investigation, the CID concluded that it found no evidence

that the pilot, co-pilot or any crew member had suicidal tendencies or a motive to deliberately

cause the crash of Flight MI 185.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    On 14 December 2000, almost three years after the crash of

Flight MI 185, the NTSC issued its Final Report. In it, the NTSC pointed out that it had conducted a

very extensive, exhaustive and complex investigation and added that it was an extremely difficult

investigation due to the degree of destruction of the aircraft, the highly fragmented wreckage, the

difficulties presented by the accident site and the lack of information from the flight recorders

during the final moments of the flight. The NTSC concluded as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The NTSC accident investigation team members and participating organisations

  have done the investigation in a thorough manner and to the best of their conscience, knowledge

  and professional expertise, taking into consideration all available data and information recovered

  and gathered during the investigation.</p>
<p align="justify">Given the limited data and information from the wreckage and flight recorders,

  the NTSC is unable to find the reasons for the departure of the aircraft from its cruising level

  of FL350 and the reasons for the stoppage of the flight recorders.</p>
<p align="justify"><u><i>The NTSC has to conclude that the technical investigation has yielded no

  evidence to explain the cause of the accident.</i></u></p>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    The United States NTSB, which participated in the

investigation as the accredited representative of the State of Design and Manufacture of the

aircraft in question, disagreed with the conclusion of the NTSC. In a letter dated 11 December 2000

to Professor Diran, Mr Jim Hall, the acting chairman of the NTSB, stated as follows:</p>
<b xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></b>The examination of all of the factual evidence is consistent with the

  conclusions that 1) no airplane-related mechanical malfunctions or failures caused or contributed

  to the accident, and 2) the accident can be explained by intentional pilot action; specifically,

  a) the accident airplanes flight profile is consistent with sustained manual nose-down flight

  control inputs, b) the evidence suggests that the cockpit voice recorder was intentionally

  disconnected, c) recovery of the airplane was possible but not attempted, and d) it is more likely

  that the nose-down flight control inputs were made by the captain than by the first officer.<b xmlns="">
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    The NTSC, which noted that it is aware that others may draw

different conclusions from the same set of facts, vigorously defended its position. The NTSBs

comments and the NTSCs response to these comments were included in Appendix N of the NTSCs

Final Report.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    Apart from suing SilkAir, some of the personal

representatives of those who died in the air crash commenced proceedings in the United States

against Boeing, the manufacturers of the aircraft, and the companies which manufactured the engines,

rudder and toilets for the aircraft. SilkAirs insurers, Singapore Aviation and General Insurance

Company (hereinafter referred to as "SAGI") have also sued Boeing as well as a number of

companies who manufactured components for the aircraft. SAGI contended that the crash of Flight MI

185 was caused by either a defective rudder control mechanism on the aircraft or a design defect in

the head or galley area. In the American action, SAGI claimed damages with respect to the loss of

the aircraft, the compensation paid to the families of those who perished in the crash and the

expenses for recovering the wreckage.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

B. THE WARSAW CONVENTION AND<br/>

THE HAGUE PROTOCOL</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    Singapore and Indonesia are both High Contracting Parties

to the Warsaw Convention while Singapore is a High Contracting Party to the amended Convention as

well. Both the Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention have the force of law in Singapore by

virtue of section 3 of the Carriage by Air Act (Chapter 32A) in so far as they relate to, inter

alia, the rights and liabilities of carriers and passengers. It is common ground that the amended

Convention is applicable to passengers who purchased a round trip ticket from Singapore while the

Warsaw Convention is applicable to passengers who purchased a single trip ticket from Jakarta to

Singapore.<i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    The main issue to be determined in this case is whether or

not SilkAir is entitled to limit its liability for the crash in accordance with the provisions of

the Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention. For this purpose, reference should be made to

Article 17 of SilkAirs General Conditions of Carriage for Passengers and Baggage, which provides

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Carriage hereunder is subject to the rules and limitations relating to

  liability established by the Convention unless such carriage is not international carriage to

  which the Convention applies. In international carriage as defined by the Warsaw Convention the

  liability of the Carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of 125,000 French gold francs or

  its equivalent (US equivalent approximately $10,000); and in international carriage as defined by

  the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague, 1955, the liability of the Carrier is limited to

  250,000 French gold francs or its equivalent (US equivalent approximately $20,000).</p>
<p align="justify">SilkAir (Singapore) Private Limited agree that for a carriage which is subject

  to the Warsaw Convention or the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague and performed on a

  SilkAir Services, not being a journey to from or having an agreed stopping place in the United

  States of America, the limit of liability for death or bodily injury to a passenger shall be

  increased to US$58,000 (or the appropriate currency equivalent) plus legal expenses or US$75,000

  (or the appropriate currency equivalent) inclusive of legal expenses in those countries where

  legal expenses are recoverable additionally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.    Under the Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention, a

carrier is barred from limiting its liability under certain circumstances. As far as the amended

Convention is concerned, Article 25 provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved

  that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with

  intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result;

  provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that

  he was acting within the scope of his employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.    As for the Warsaw Convention, it provides that the right of

a carrier to limit its liability will be lost if the circumstances of the accident fall within the

ambit of Article 25, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of

  this Convention which exclude or limit his liability, if the damage is caused by his wilful

  misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the court seised of

  the case, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Similarly the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the said

  provisions if the damage is caused as aforesaid by any servant or agent of the carrier acting

  within the scope of his employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

C. THE PLEADINGS</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.    The main ground for the plaintiffs assertion that

SilkAir is not entitled to limit its liability for the crash of Flight MI 185 in accordance with the

provisions of the Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention is stated in para 12 of their amended

Statement of Claim in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">As the [NTSC] investigations have not found any indication that anyone else was

  in the cockpit other than the two pilots in the final minutes before the stoppage of the CVR, the

  plaintiffs aver that the irresistible inference is that the manual input from the cockpit setting

  the horizontal stabilizer of the said aircraft to a nose-down trim which caused the crash of

  SilkAir Flight MI 185, was the result of the wilful misconduct or default of either or both of the

  Defendants servants or agents having control of the aircraft, or was done by either or both

  with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    In the alternative, the plaintiffs asserted that Captain

Tsu caused the crash of Flight MI 185. In para 13 of their amended Statement of Claim, the

plaintiffs asserted:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Further or in the alternative the Plaintiffs aver that the irresistible

  inference to be drawn from the facts disclosed by <i>inter alia </i>the NTSC investigations and

  the Defendants to date, is that the sustained flight control inputs were made by Captain Tsu who

  had committed prior breaches of the proper safety procedures and/or of international safety

  standards that were in force at the material time and who had a history and record of failure to

  observe and/or to comply with proper safety procedures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    The plaintiffs also asserted that the crash was caused by

the default of SilkAir in permitting Captain Tsu to take control of Flight MI 185.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    Initially, the plaintiffs contended that the aircraft was

unsafe and defective and that by operating the aircraft, SilkAir acted recklessly and with knowledge

that damage would probably result. Furthermore, they took the position that SilkAir failed to

maintain the aircraft to ensure its airworthiness. During the trial, the plaintiffs amended their

statement of claim and deleted paragraph 17, which alleged that the aircraft was unsafe and

defective, and paragraph 18, which alleged that SilkAir had failed to properly maintain the aircraft

to ensure its airworthiness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    SilkAir denied that intentional or reckless pilot action

caused the crash of Flight MI 185 and asserted that the NTSC rightly concluded in its Final Report

that the cause of the crash could not be ascertained. SilkAir also took the position that the

descent and crash of the aircraft may have been due to the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(a) depressurisation or rapid depressurisation of the aircraft or a faulty indication of

  depressurisation; and/or</p>
<p align="justify">(b) mechanical failure; and/or</p>
<p align="justify">(c) rudder failure; and/or</p>
<p align="justify">(d) some other undetermined cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    Although the plaintiffs amended their statement of claim

and withdrew the allegation that the aircraft was unsafe or defective, SilkAirs counsel, Mr Lok

Vi Ming, noted that in a number of actions in the United States against Boeing and the manufacturers

of parts of the aircraft, some of the plaintiffs in the present case asserted that Boeings

breaches and negligence were the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185. Mr Lok said that this

contradicts their contentions in the present proceedings that the irresistible inference is that the

pilot intentionally crashed the plane. He added that the plaintiffs assertions in the Singapore

and United States courts are diametrically opposed to each other and are irreconcilable.</p>

D. EVIDENCE FROM THE CRASH SITE<br/>

AND SIMULATION TESTS</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    To determine whether or not Flight MI 185 was intentionally

crashed, the evidence from the crash site and the results of simulation tests will first be

considered.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The NTSCs findings on the evidence from the crash site</p></b>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The NTSCs findings on the evidence from the crash site were summarised in its

Final Report as follows:</p>
<ul xmlns="">
<li>There was no evidence found of in-flight fire or explosions.</li>
<li>From flutter analysis and wreckage distribution study, the empennage break-up could have

    occurred in the range between 5,000 and 12,000 feet altitude.</li>
<li>Examination of engine wreckage indicated that the conditions of the engines at impact were not

    inconsistent with high engine rotation speed. No indications were found of in-flight high energy

    uncontained engine failures. Therefore, the engines were considered to be not a factor

    contributing to the accident.</li>
<li>Examination of the actuators of flight and ground spoilers, trailing and leading edge flaps,

    as well as engine thrust reversers indicate retracted or stowed positions of the respective

    systems.</li>
<li>Examination of the main rudder power control unit (including the servo-valve), the yaw damper

    modulating piston, the rudder trim actuator, the rudder trim and feel centering unit, the

    standby rudder PCU, the aileron PCUs, the elevator PCUs, and the horizontal stabilizer

    jack-screw components, revealed no indications or evidence of pre-impact malfunctions.</li>
<li>Examination of the 370 kg of recovered electrical wires, connectors and circuit boards showed

    no indication or evidence of corrosion, shorting, burning or arcing in these wires or parts.</li>
<li>The CVR stopped recording at 09:05:15.6 and the FDR stopped recording at 09:11:33.7. The

    examination of the CVR and FDR showed no malfunction of the units. The stoppages could be

    attributed to a loss of power supply to the units. However, there were no indications or

    evidence found to conclude on the reason for the stoppages due to the loss of power. The cause

    of the CVR and FDR stoppages and the reason for the time difference between the stoppages could

    not be concluded.</li>
<li>The inspection of the aircraft maintenance records did not reveal any defects or anomalies

    that could have affected the airworthiness of the aircraft or that may have been a factor

    contributing to the accident.</li>
<li>The horizontal stabilizer trim was found to be in the 2.5 units position which matched the

    forward limit of the manual electrical trim.</li>
</ul>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The simulation tests</p>
</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    A number of simulation tests were conducted on the basis of

the limited radar data that was available. The first and second tests were conducted on 23 January

1998 and 12 May 1998 at the Boeing M-Cab simulator facility in Seattle. The objective of these tests

was "to explore and understand the various possible combination of one or more malfunctions of

flight controls, aircraft systems and power plants that would result in the extreme descent flight

trajectory as suggested by the radar plots".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    A third simulation test was conducted by the NTSC at Garudas

B737-300 simulator facility in Jakarta on 17 February 1999 and 6 March 1999. The NTSC also performed

computer fly-out studies of Flight MI 185s descent trajectory with scenarios similar to those

used at the simulation tests at the Boeing simulator facility in Seattle on 12 May 1998. Finally, a

fourth simulation test was conducted on 13 July 1999 at the Boeing simulator facility in Seattle to

review and reaffirm the results of the simulation tests already conducted.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    The following extract from para 2.10 of the NTSCs Final

Report explains the tests conducted and the results obtained:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The last five [Air Traffic Control] radar points recorded represent the flight

  trajectory of the aircraft from the cruise altitude 35,000 feet to approximately 19,500 feet. Each

  point consisted of data relating to time, altitude and geographical coordinates.</p>
<p align="justify">Simulator tests and computer simulation fly-out studies were done to determine

  failures or combination of failures of the flight control and autopilot systems that could result

  in the extreme descent trajectory. Aircraft flight data were not available for the time period

  after the stoppage of the FDR. The initial condition for these tests and studies was cruise

  configuration at 35,000 feet based on the last known FDR data. The altitude range for the

  simulations was from 35,000 feet to approximately 19,500 feet.</p>
<p align="justify">The results of these simulation studies  are summarized as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul xmlns="">
<li>Any single failure of the primary flight controls such as hard-over or jamming of aileron,

    rudder or elevator did not result in a descent time history similar to that of the last ATC

    radar points. In simulations of these flight control failure conditions the aircraft could be

    recovered to normal flight manually.</li>
<li>Any single failure of the secondary flight controls such as hard over or jamming of yaw

    damper, or runaway of the stabilizer trim would not result in a descent time history similar to

    that of the last ATC radar points. In simulations of these flight control failure conditions the

    aircraft could be recovered to normal flight manually.</li>
<li>Manipulation of the primary flight controls without horizontal stabilizer trim would result in

    a descent time history similar to that of the last ATC radar points. But this required large

    control column input forces and the aircraft was subjected to a loading exceeding 2 G. However,

    if the control column input forces and the aircraft were relaxed, in the simulations the

    aircraft would recover from the steep descent due to its inherent stability.</li>
<li>Among other possibilities, a combination of changing the stabilizer trim from about 4.5 to 2.5

    units and an aileron input could result in a descent time history similar to that of the last

    ATC radar points. This simulated descent trajectory would result in the aircraft entering an

    accelerating spiral and being subjected to a loading of less than 2 G. Furthermore, the aircraft

    would continue in the spiral even when the control forces were relaxed.</li>

Plaintiffs interpretation of the evidence</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    The plaintiffs asserted that there was ample evidence that

Flight MI 185 was brought down as a result of intentional pilot inputs in the cockpit. In support of

their assertion, the plaintiffs relied on, inter alia, the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p align="justify">(a) The projected flight trajectory of the final descent of the aircraft from

  its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet to 19,500 feet.</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs pointed out that the speed of the aircrafts descent from its

  cruising altitude of 35,000 feet to 19,500 feet and the steep angle of the descent were alarming.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(b) The position of the jackscrew of the horizontal stabilizer and the fact

  that the engines were at full throttle.</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs said that the fact that the horizontal stabilizer trim was found

  to be at 2.5 units meant that the aircraft had been programmed by the pilot or pilots to dive down

  in the steepest possible position. They also asserted that the fact that the engines were at full

  throttle indicated that no attempt had been made to recover the aircraft from its dive into the

  Musi River.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(c) The simulation studies based on the flight trajectory to determine what

  might have happened in the cockpit during the final moments of Flight MI 185.</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs, who accepted that a change in the horizontal stabilizer trim

  from 4.5 units to 2.5 units alone would not cause the plane to plunge down as fast as it did from

  its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet to 19,500 feet, contended that the descent history of Flight

  MI 185 resulted from a change in the horizontal stabilizer trim to 2.5 units, an aileron input

  and/or a large control column input. They pointed out that the NTSB noted that on the basis of the

  engineering simulations, it is very likely that from the time the aircraft departed from cruise

  flight until the end of the recorded data, it was responding to sustained flight control inputs

  from the cockpit.</p>

  Plaintiffs expert witnesses agreed with the NTSB<i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.    The plaintiffs three expert witnesses agreed with the

NTSBs conclusions on the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185. The first expert witness, Captain

John Laming, an air crash consultant, an experienced pilot and a flight simulator instructor,

conducted his own simulation tests to ascertain what might have caused the crash of the aircraft. He

said as follows in his report:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Study of the NTSC Accident Report, coupled with extensive personal experience

  in command of the 737 aircraft, leads me to the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Only continually applied manual control forces by someone on the flight deck,

    accompanied by deliberate action to activate full forward electrical stabiliser trim control and

    full engine power, would force the aircraft into such a steep dive as that experienced by MI

    185. With these actions held for a number of seconds and no attempt taken to recover, the

    aircraft would eventually reach the point of no return and break up.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.    When cross-examined, Captain Laming reiterated his position

in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">For what purpose I dont know. All Im saying there is quite

  straightforward. Someone pressed the stabilizer trim switch and held it for 7 seconds --- 8

  seconds. You can cause your own conclusions on this. I cannot say for deliberate crashing of the

  plane or  someone who was playing silly people. I dont know. Someone held the switch forward

  because it takes such a long time to get that switch forward.<br/>

  (V/N p 270)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.    The plaintiffs second expert witness, Captain Maurie

Baston, a former chief flying instructor at the Royal Australian Air Force Central Flying School and

a former aerobatic display pilot, agreed that the aircraft had been deliberately crashed. He stated

as follows in his report:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I  agree  that having regard to all the evidence and the facts as found

  during the investigation, that the probable cause of the crash was intentional pilot action. In my

  opinion, there is more than sufficient available technical evidence to support the view that the

  aircraft was literally driven to the ground<i>.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.    When cross-examined, Captain Baston explained what he meant

by "technical evidence" in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[T]here was no technical evidence to suggest that the aircraft had any major

  component damage prior to impact. There was considerable technical evidence, both factual and

  theoretical, to say that the aircraft followed a certain trajectory in a certain time; there was

  an average rate of descent over the first rough 15,000 feet or 30,000 feet a minute, which is 15

  times the normal cruise descent rate; is 3 times the normal emergency descent rate, and to achieve

  those sort of descent rates which would have been increased a little later, you can only conclude

  with competency, not in doubt, that there had to be a deliberate action of some sort. It wasnt

  in my view, accidental.<br/>

  (V/N p 448)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.    The plaintiffs third expert witness, Mr Macarthur Job,

an air safety consultant, concluded as follows in his report:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In summary, the investigative findings strongly support the conclusions that no

  airplane-related mechanical malfunctions or failures caused or contributed to the accident, and

  the accident can be explained by intentional pilot action.</p>
<u><b>
</b></u></blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>

  SilkAirs expert witnesses disagreed with the plaintiffs assertions</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.    SilkAirs expert witnesses did not agree that Flight MI

185 crashed as a result of intentional pilot inputs in the cockpit. They thus agreed with the NTSC,

which, when responding to the NTSBs assertion that the aircrafts flight profile is consistent

with sustained nose-down manual flight control inputs, stated its position as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There is no evidence to conclude that there was manual intervention. After the

  stoppage of the FDR, which occurred before the airplane started its descent, there was no data

  available on the inputs made to flight control surfaces or engine thrust levers up to the point of

  impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.    Emeritus Professor Denis Howe of the College of Aeronautics

of Cranfield University, an aviation consultant and a former Professor of Aircraft Design, said that

the NTSC had rightly decided not to identify the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185 in spite of a

thorough and detailed investigation. When questioned by Mr Lok, he explained:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Well, Professor Diran and his team had examined all the evidence that they had

  available and they had come to the conclusion that they could not find convincing evidence to

  allocate any cause to the accident,  and in this respect of course they were following the NTSB

  action in that infamous Colorado Springs event . There, the NTSB, although they felt they knew

  the answer being a wind sheer or a rotor problem on the aircraft  and also had ruled out as a

  very remote possibility any difficulty with the controls of the aircraft, nevertheless just had

  this feeling that they did not have enough evidence to come to any conclusion. And we know they

  were right in that because subsequent events at Pittsburgh and afterwards actually showed that had

  they come to the conclusion that it was a rotor or wind sheer which they were inclined to do, they

  would have been wrong.<br/>

  (V/N p 1180)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.    SilkAirs other expert witness, Captain Robert Galan, a

French aeronautical expert, a test pilot and an experienced aircraft accident investigator, also

asserted that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the aircraft had been deliberately

crashed. In his view, the final descent of Flight MI 185 was an emergency descent and not a

deliberate descent for the purpose of crashing the aircraft. When cross-examined, he said as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I consider that the descent of the accident looks like an emergency descent .

  This behaviour is really coherent with an emergency descent but not coherent at all with something

  which is [a] voluntary descent.. [I]t is  more likely that it is a bad emergency descent

  than a voluntary descent.<br/>

  (V/N p 1078)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.    When Mr Khoo SC pointed out that the question of an

emergency descent did not arise because the aircraft was going down far too fast for such a descent,

Captain Galan disagreed vehemently. He said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">. I am discussing about the beginning, because after that, something

  occurred, I dont know what, but the descent which was at the beginning, an emergency descent,

  became something completely wrong . But at the beginning, it looked exactly like an emergency

  descent.<br/>

  (V/N p 1124)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.    Captain Galan, who stressed that the pilot did not

deliberately fly out of the flight envelope, summed up his position during cross-examination as

follows:</p>
<u xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></u>Q. [W]hen you say that the aircraft was flown inadvertently out of the

  normal flight envelope, you are concluding that this was a proper descent?

<p align="justify" xmlns="">A. No, no, no. I am saying that he went out of the normal envelope inadvertently

because it started as an emergency descent. And after that, it went out of the envelope. <i><u>So he

did not decide to crash</u>.</i></p>
<p xmlns="">(V/N p 1107; emphasis added)<u></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.    Professor Howe took the view that the NTSB concluded that

the accident can be explained by intentional pilot action because it was influenced by what it

believed to have been the flight trajectory of the aircrafts final descent from its cruising

altitude of 35,000 feet, simulation studies based on the projected flight trajectory and the fact

that the horizontal stabilizer trim was found at the crash site to have been at 2.5 units. His

criticisms of all these assumptions will be considered below.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p><br/>

Whether the radar data relied on for charting the flight trajectory of the aircrafts final

descent is accurate</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.    To begin with, Professor Howe questioned the accuracy of

the radar data, which was relied on for reconstructing the flight trajectory of the aircrafts

final descent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.    For the reconstructed flight trajectory of Flight MI 185s

final descent to be relevant to an investigation on the cause of the crash, the radar data on which

it was based must be correct. When cross-examined, Mr Job accepted that as there is no other data

regarding the aircrafts final descent from its cruising altitude, the accuracy of the radar data

is very important. (V/N pp 790-791) A similar view was expressed by Captain Baston. (V/N p 473)</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.    Professor Howe said that it must be borne in mind that the

flight trajectory of the final descent of Flight MI 185 was projected on the basis of radar data

furnished by the Indonesian authorities, adjusted by Hughes-Raytheon, the manufacturers of the

radar, and re-adjusted by Boeing and the NTSB. This was pointed out in paras 1.18.2.2 and 1.18.2.3

of the NTSCs Final Report, which stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The radar data and information recorded and displayed by the GUARDIAN system

  were sent to the United States in January 1998 for examination at Hughes Raytheon [Air Traffic

  Control] laboratory at Fullerton, California. Data from Soekarno-Hatta (Jakarta) and Palembang

  [Secondary Surveillance Radar] were selected for the examination as these two radars covered the

  flight path of MI 185 and provided information on date, time, altitude, x/y position, x/y

  velocity, ground speeds, range, azimuth and minimum visible altitude.</p>
<p align="justify">The radar data and information retrieved from the GUARDIAN system was further

  examined and corrected, by Boeing as well as NTSB, focusing particularly on the last twelve radar

  returns. Based on this final radar data, the aircraft flight path and its ground track projection

  was reconstructed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.    Professor Howe asserted that the corrected radar data and

the reconstructed flight trajectory of the aircraft during its final descent from its cruising

altitude of 35,000 feet to an altitude of 19,500 feet were fundamentally flawed because if they were

correct, the aircraft would have flown much faster than the speed of sound, a speed which was beyond

the capabilities of a Boeing-737. In para 19 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he explained as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The radar data given in the Final Report indicates a 32 second time elapse

  between departure from 35,000 feet cruise altitude and the last data at 19,500 feet altitude. This

  represents an average rate of descent of 36,600 feet/minute. The rate of descent during the first

  8 seconds of this period is modest, achieving about 8,000 feet/minute at 34,600 feet. It is

  estimated that the final vertical speed would need to be about 1,200 feet/second to be consistent

  with the data. That is in excess of the speed of sound. This is a speed the aircraft would be

  unlikely to be able to reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.    When Professor Howe was cross-examined, he reiterated his

misgivings about the accuracy of the corrected radar data when he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [H]ave you any reason or any information which would suggest that the

  corrected data as presented in the NTSC Report is wrong?</p>
<p align="justify">A. . The information that I have deduced that the corrected radar data is

  wrong, is because I believe it implies a flight path for the aircraft towards the end of its

  descent to 19,500 feet, which was unrealistic. It implies Mach numbers considerably in excess of a

  Mach number of 1, and every expert witness so far and Boeing, by their testimony on Figure 14 of

  the report, also suggest that the aircraft cannot go above Mach 1. So my deduction is that the

  radar data is incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1274)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.    Captain Galan agreed with Professor Howe that a speed in

excess of Mach 1 far exceeded the design capability of most commercial aircraft, including the B-737

in question.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46.    Captain Baston testified that while the aircrafts speed

may not have reached Mach 1, the speed of the wing airflow could have reached Mach 1. Professor Howe

countered that this did not affect his assertion regarding the unachievable speed of the aircraft if

the flight path of the aircrafts final descent is to be believed. He explained:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The situation is that as the aircraft increases its Mach number from something

  in the case of Boeing 737, a Mach number of 0.8, the local airspeeds over parts of the aerofoil

  section, especially the upper surface of the wing, will increase above the overall Mach number of

  the aircraft as a whole, due to the curvature of the surface and the cross-sectional area of the

  wing. And therefore, there will be parts of the aircraft which will reach Mach numbers in excess

  of Mach 1, probably at speeds overall aircraft speeds of from about 0.89 onwards but certainly by

  0.9  Mach number of 0.95. But here the question really is, what is the speed of the aircraft as

  a whole? In other words, the flight speed of the aircraft along its flight path, not the local

  airspeeds. So Captain Baston is quite right, there will be local areas on the aircraft which could

  be Mach 1 or higher, but overall I think he actually is saying that the aircraft itself would not

  exceed Mach 1.<br/>

  (V/N pp 1331-1332)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.    When Mr Khoo SC pointed out that the corrected radar data

had been accepted by the NTSC, Professor Howe stood his ground. He said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. But we know that the investigation team accepted the final radar data as

  correct .</p>
<p align="justify">A. They are relying upon it for their non-conclusion, yes. I would add that the

  radar information was supplied to them by NTSB, and one of the difficulties that Professor Diran

  had, was his own lack of resources in his own country and he has necessity to rely upon evidence

  from elsewhere. And his final recommendation is almost a cry from the heart, that he felt very

  exposed that having to rely upon this data, and he recommended that there should be an Asian air

   investigation organised and established so that in Asia, you could become independent .</p>
<p align="justify">Q. You see, Professor Howe, on the assumption that the corrected data is

  correct </p>
<p align="justify">A. Which I will not accept.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1275)</p>
</blockquote>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Reliability of the corrected radar data is an issue in the United States proceedings</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.    It is worth noting that the reliability of the corrected

radar data is an issue in proceedings in the United States against, inter alia, Boeing, with respect

to the crash of Flight MI 185. In those proceedings, the American counsel for some of the plaintiffs

in the present case went so far as to insinuate that everyone who corrected the radar data

"eyeballed it so that it could work out right", an accusation which was of course denied.

The following extract from Boeings Mr Martin Inghams deposition provides a rather clear

picture of the position:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    Well, basically what you did was you took the raw data , decided that

  that has to be in error because of some other things that you looked at, --</p>
<p align="justify">A. Right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q.  [A]nd you just moved it <i>so that it would work out right from your

  point of view in terms of the track of the airplane.</i></p>
<p align="justify">A. The process that moved this was deemed satisfactory to all the members who

  reviewed this, not just Boeing, but the NTSB as well as Raytheon, so it was an accepted correction

  by all the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Without the pejorative connotation of the term eyeballing, what you did was

  you found a data point that you didnt like and you moved it to where you thought it should be?</p>
<p align="justify">A. We found data points that were not correct and we corrected them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.    Boeings representative, Mr Ingham, agreed that the

correction of one of the radar points resulted in it being moved some two and a half miles from its

uncorrected point because, in his own words, "the azimuth data that was used to produce the

original data for that particular point was in error." This change resulted in a different

flight trajectory. When cross-examined, Captain Baston said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [B]ecause its already displaced, the starting point is displaced by two

  and a half nautical miles, there will be a different set of trajectory.</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 471)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.    It is not surprising that SilkAirs counsel, Mr Lok,

pointed out that it is ironical that while the plaintiffs relied on the corrected radar data in the

present proceedings, they were challenging the reliability of the said data in their actions in the

United States.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Projected descent below 19,500 feet was also criticised</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.    Apart from criticising the corrected radar data, Professor

Howe was also wary of the projected descent of the aircraft from an altitude of 19,500 feet to

ground level. When cross-examined about the projected descent of the aircraft to the point of

impact, he explained why he had reservations about it when he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. And what about right to the descent of the aircraft  at impact?</p>
<p align="justify">A. The data doesnt go beyond that because the last radar point was at 19,500

  [feet] and anything that goes beyond that point down is pure assumption because we had no eye

  witnesses as far as I know with a watch in their hand measuring the time of impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1305)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.    Captain Galan also had reservations about the projected

descent of the aircraft from an altitude of 19,500 feet to ground level. When cross-examined, he

said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [L]ets assume there was no radar data at all. Dont you think you can

  tell what the rate of descent was?</p>

The irrelevant evidence regarding the uncorrected radar data</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.    At this juncture, it ought to be noted that Professor Howes

evidence that the corrected radar data relied upon in the NTSCs Final Report differed from the

uncorrected radar data in a document furnished to him by someone from Singapore Airlines cannot be

taken into account because the authenticity of the said document was not established. The exclusion

of this portion of his evidence does not affect the veracity of his assertion that the corrected

radar data is flawed. When Mr Khoo SC suggested that his assertion that the corrected radar data is

inaccurate rested on an unknown source of radar data, Professor Howe replied as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">No, no, no, based on the implications of that data in terms of what it means in

  Mach number of the aircraft at the end but nothing to do with unknown source. Completely ignore

  that. On the data as presented, it gives to me an unrealistic flight path requiring the aircraft

  to achieve Mach numbers which are outside anything that any of the witnesses said can be achieved.<br/>

  (V/N p 1302)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54.    When subsequently questioned by Mr Lok, Professor Howe

reiterated that his conclusions on the inaccuracy of the corrected radar data remain valid even if

the document containing the uncorrected radar data is totally disregarded. He said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. And .. the problem you have [with respect to the data] irrespective of, that

  means independent of, the set of initial radar data that you were given by somebody from

Extent of the applicability of the simulation tests</p></b><i>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.    Apart from doubting the accuracy of the corrected radar

data, Professor Howe also questioned the extent to which simulation test results may be applied to a

case such as this, where the aircraft had already flown beyond its flight envelope or limits. The

NTSC was fully aware of this. In its response to the NTSBs comments on its draft Final Report,

the NTSC stated that it "recognised that simulation tests cannot fully replicate actual flight

conditions especially flight conditions beyond the normal flight envelope".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.    Professor Howe said that simulation studies are only useful

when investigating situations occurring within the normal flight envelope. In para 14 of his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Final Report [of the NTSC] does suggest (paragraph 2.10) that the

  combination of maximum nose-down trim setting of the actuator and aileron can result in the

  aircraft entering an uncontrolled spiral. There is however no evidence that this occurred. This

  postulation is based on simulation studies conducted by the NTSC, NTSB and Boeing. In my opinion,

  simulation studies are only useful tools when investigating situations occurring within the normal

  flight envelope. If an aircraft goes beyond the test clearance flight envelope, as the radar

  readings in this case clearly indicate, any simulation study is based on pure extrapolation beyond

  a certain point. It is inappropriate to place any reliance on such studies as proof in these

<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.    When questioned by Mr Lok, Professor Howe elucidated his

view in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">. Clearly, what I am saying is that very early on, possibly soon after

  31,900 feet, down here somewhere, the aircraft went right outside the extrapolated data even

  which, in fact, is the validated area for the simulator. [T]herefore any attempt to match these

  radar points to simulator studies is not tenable because the radar points actually show the

  aircraft going a long way outside anything that any simulator has been validated for. And so

  conclusions made that the flight which is being proposed by NTSB, for example, and I believe also

  followed by the plaintiffs that the simulator studies can actually confirm what happened to the

  aeroplane, I believe, is erroneous.</p>

The horizontal stabilizer</p></b><i>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.    Apart from questioning the veracity of the projected flight

path of the aircrafts final descent and the applicability of the simulation tests, Professor Howe

also thought that the plaintiffs case did not rest on solid ground because it depended to a great

extent on the fact that the horizontal stabilizer trim was found to be at 2.5 units when it was

recovered from the wreckage. As has been mentioned, this matched the forward limit of a pilots

ability to operate the main electrical trim to put the aircraft in the steepest possible nose-down

position.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.    Although the NTSC asserted that there was no evidence that

pilot input was responsible for the final position of the horizontal stabilizer trim, the plaintiffs

insisted that the fact that it was found to be at 2.5 units must be taken into account when

determining whether or not that the aircraft was intentionally crashed. Professor Howe, who declared

that the "pivotal aspect" upon which the dissenting NTSB report relied on is that the

setting of the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator was found to be in the maximum cruise nose-down

trim position, was not convinced that this was the final setting by the pilots. In paras 11-12 of

his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">11. It should firstly be pointed out that examination of photographs of the

  recovered wreckage indicates that the setting of the nut on the ball screw may actually be at some

  position between the normal cruise and maximum cruise nose-down trim position ..</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) On the basis of the location of fracture, a calculation of approximately

    3.05 units trim setting is obtained.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">This, if correct, does indicate that the stabilizer was not at the maximum

    nose-down trim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">12. Further, even if the NTSC is correct to say that the ball screw actuator

  was at the maximum cruise nose-down setting at the time of the recovery of the wreckage, there is

  no evidence that it was at this setting position at the time of the initial descent of the

  aircraft from its controlled cruising flight. In fact, the simulation study of the Cranfield

  Impact Centre has shown that should the ball screw/nut unit be severed from the drive unit at its

  lower end and the stabilizer arm at its upper end, the nut can rotate on the screw even under

  substantial friction conditions. Such a severance of the ball screw/nut assembly could well have

  occurred at the time when the horizontal stabilizer disintegrated and parts separated from the

  rest of the airframe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.    When cross-examined, Professor Howe explained his position

in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> [O]ne of the few things we do know in this accident is that certain parts

  of the horizontal stabilizer failed due to flutter. A flutter failure is a very, very violent

  failure indeed. The Boeing estimation was that there were 22 oscillations per second .The

  only issue is when it occurred. And my proposal is it actually occurred at some time during the

  descent of the aircraft, at the time in fact the horizontal stabilizer fluttered and failed.

  Looking at the nature of the wreckage from wreckage photographs, also indicates that there may

  have been some damage to the ball screw actuator subsequent to that failure indicating that at

  impact, there may have been further damage which may not have occurred had it been attached to the

  impact point. So my contention is that there could well have been a failure of the attachment

  of the ball screw actuator to the front of the horizontal stabilizer in the fuselage, and that

  this failure having occurred, the ball screw itself could then rotate because it was no longer

  constrained, and turn through a number of turns in a relatively short period.<br/>

  (V/N pp 1189-1191)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62.    Mr Lok pointed out that while Professor Howes view is

based on the results of the tests undertaken by the Cranfield Impact Centre, the plaintiffs

expert witnesses had not carried out any independent experiment to verify the final setting of the

horizontal stabilizer trim before the separation of the actuator from the rest of the airframe. As

such, they were in no position to challenge Professor Howes view. In fact, Captain Laming

conceded that it was possible that the horizontal stabilizer trim may not have been finally set at

2.5 units. (V/N p 329) However, he added that whether or not the horizontal stabilizer trim was at

2.5 units or 3.05 units was not fundamental to his conclusions. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC, he

explained as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Would it have mattered to your conclusion whether the forward trim was at

  3.05 or 2.5 units in respect of the descent  rate of descent, angle of dive?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No, very little difference.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. And could you explain to his Honour why? .</p>
<p align="justify">A. Because once the stabiliser trim is moved out of its normal cruise position

  for several seconds, each second becomes more critical. So we are talking, I think, 10 seconds

  from 4.5 to 2.5 and 7 seconds from 4.5 to 3.05. That is still  a most unusually long completed

  application of the trim. It will still cause a very steep dive; a most unusual application.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 387)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63.    Professor Howe, who was not prepared to concede that the

horizontal stabilizer trim was finally set at 3.05 units when the aircraft started to descend, said

that it could have been set at a higher number. When questioned by Mr Lok, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [B]ased on this study, you feel that at the point of impact, it would have

  been 3.05 [units]?</p>
<p align="justify">A. That is correct.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. But that reading of 3.05 may not necessarily be the final setting of the

  horizontal stabilizer at the point of the descent of the plane?</p>
<p align="justify">A. At the point the aircraft started to descend, no. I would agree that it was

  not necessarily set at 3.05.</p>

<p align="justify">(V/N p 1208)</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">64.    Taking all circumstances into account, Professor Howes

evidence on the final setting of the horizontal stabilizer trim gives much food for thought.</p>

Whether the pilots attempted to recover the aircraft</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65.    The plaintiffs assertion that the pilots did not attempt

to recover the aircraft from its dive into the Musi River will next be considered. The plaintiffs

relied on the following comments of the NTSB on the NTSCs draft Final Report to support their

assertion:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Regardless of the reason for the airplanes departure from cruise flight, it

  could have been easily recovered using conventional techniques that both pilots had received

  training for and that were within the capabilities of both pilots. Further, there was ample time

  for the pilots to take such corrective action to return the airplane to a straight and level

  attitude and flight.  It is apparent that, had the pilot attempted to recover by initiating

  immediate corrective action using standard flight control inputs and techniques, the airplane

  would have recovered to a straight and level altitude with a minimum loss of altitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66.    SilkAirs counsel, Mr Lok, contended that it could not be

assumed that the pilots did not try to recover the aircraft. After all, the NTSC had noted as

follows in its comments on the NTSBs views:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There was no evidence that the recovery of the airplane was not attempted. The

  fact that during impact the engine was in high power and that the undercarriage was retracted do

  not preclude the possibility of pilot attempts to recover from the steep dive by using flight

  controls and varying engine thrust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67.    Mr Lok accepted that the textbook procedure for effecting

an emergency descent in the face of rapid cabin depressurisation is to simultaneously retard the

thrust levers, deploy the speed brakes and initiate the descent of the aircraft. However, he added

that a pilot who is executing an emergency descent may, depending on the circumstances of the case,

find it necessary to increase the engine thrust. His argument was supported by Captain Galan, who

said that a failure to accelerate may, in some cases, result in a bad descent. He explained the

position as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">You could have two different sorts of descent which [are] no good. The very

  bad descent is a descent in which you dont accelerate. You descend but in keeping your actual

  speed. In this case,  this descent will be a bad one because you need a long time to descend to

  10,000 feet which is around the good altitude to end in emergency descent. You take a long time,

  you need maybe something like two, three minutes, which is too long because in the certification

  pattern, we have a minimum time to follow. So pilots are trained not to use this way, this

  pattern. There is another bad descent which is to try to descend too much, too quick and to

  accelerate before reducing the engine.<br/>

  (V/N pp 1029-1030)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68.    Professor Howe agreed that it could not be assumed that the

pilots did not try to recover the aircraft from its dive. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    Leaving aside the radar results, we find at the bottom of the river, a

  throttle box - . Full thrust forward . Nose speed brakes, engines in high rotation. Is that

  consistent with an attempt to recover?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I cannot answer that question. I would say you were right in suggesting it

  may not be. But then, I do not know what the final flight path of the aircraft was at the time

  when final control of the aircraft was lost. The pilot may have been attempting to recover from a

  dive, in which case he may have wanted to lift the nose of the aircraft up. He certainly might,

  what not, speed brakes. I cannot answer that question but I dont believe we have enough

  scenario information at all.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1283)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69.    Professor Howe added that having an increased engine thrust

could retard the dive of a plane. When questioned by Mr Lok, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. And in your understanding, a throttle in high thrust, could that be used ---

  could that be evidence of a possible application by the pilot to recover the plane?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes, because it will give a nose-up pitch and it will tend to give him a

  more horizontal flight path.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1322)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70.    Captain Laming accepted that having the engines on high

thrust could retard the dive of an aircraft. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    Would it be correct  that if the thrust is increased to the engines,

  that the increased thrust would provide an additional lift to the plane?</p>
<p>A.    That is true.</p>
<p>Q.    . [T]herefore the fact that the engines are put at high thrust, could

  it have the effect of  retarding the dive of the plane?</p>
<p>A.    That could be.</p>
<p>Q.    . [It] is therefore not necessary in fact for the engines to be at high

  thrust for your theory?</p>
<p>A.    If you had the engines off  I think the dive will probably be steeper.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 363)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71.    Mr Lok submitted that as an increased thrust provides

additional lift to an aircraft and could be an indication of recovery action by the pilots, the only

inference that can be drawn from the evidence with respect to the throttle box is that if the pilots

had applied forward thrust, they must have intended to recover the aircraft from its dive and not to

destroy it. What may be said with confidence is that the fact that the engines were at high power

before the crash does not, without more, assist the plaintiffs in establishing that the aircraft was

deliberately crashed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72.    It should also be borne in mind that recovery of an

aircraft becomes more difficult once it has left its normal flight envelope. Captain Galan made it

clear that the ability to control the aircraft in question during its final descent must be viewed

in the context of an aircraft that had inadvertently left its flight envelope.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73.    Mr Job accepted that it is more difficult to recover an

aircraft once it has left its flight envelope. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Assuming a pilot who did that input, nose down trim, elevator is down, had

  wanted to make a recovery at say, 18,000 or 15,000 feet, at 15,000 feet, could he have made a

  recovery?</p>
<p align="justify">A. This is entering into the area of very high Mach numbers and the behaviour

  of an aircraft is unpredictable in that area. Im not qualified to say what degree of recovery

  could have been achieved in that area. But it would have been difficult.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 813)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74.    When questioned further by Mr Khoo SC, Mr Job accepted that

it is possible that there was an attempted recovery of the aircraft from its dive but this failed

because the aircraft went beyond the point of recoverability. (V/N p 863)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75.    The question of recovering an aircraft which has left its

flight envelope was also noted by the NTSC, which recommended that flight crew be trained in

"recovery from high speed flight upsets beyond the normal flight envelope to enhance pilot

awareness on the possibility of unexpected hazardous flight situations". The NTSB objected to

this recommendation as it implied that the NTSC had concluded that the accident may have been caused

by an unexpected unusual flight upset and that the flight crew had not been properly trained to

handle the aircraft in such a situation. The NTSC responded to the NTSBs objection in the

following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The evidence showed that the airplane had exceeded its flight envelope during

  its high-speed transonic descent. This recommendation is to generate crew awareness of the

  narrow margin between the normal high-speed flight regime and the limits of the flight envelope,

  and the hazards of exceeding the normal flight envelope.</p>

Whether the CVR and FDR were intentionally disconnected</p></u>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76.    No discussion of whether or not the aircraft was

intentionally crashed will be complete without a consideration of the plaintiffs allegation that

the CVR and FDR were deliberately disabled to hide the sinister intention of the errant pilot or

pilots to down the aircraft. In their view, someone in the cockpit intentionally tampered with the

circuit breakers of the equipment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77.    The NTSC stated that an examination of the CVR and the FDR

revealed no malfunction of the units. As far as the CVR is concerned, its manufacturers, Allied

Signals, reported that the loss of power was most likely not due to the pulling of the circuit

breaker as there was no audio indication of such an act. A subsequent test revealed that the ambient

noise of an aircraft in the air could obscure any sound resulting from the pulling of the circuit

breaker. The result of this test does not establish whether or not the circuit breaker had been

pulled out. As such, there is no evidence that the circuit breaker had been pulled out by someone in

the cockpit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78.    The NTSC pointed out that the stoppage of the CVR and FDR

could be attributed to a loss of power supply to the units but noted that there was no evidence to

explain this. It added that a break in the wire supplying power to the CVR could also have led to

its stoppage but as only a limited amount of electrical wires was found, it could not be determined

if this had caused the equipment to stop running. In view of the uncertainties, the NTSC concluded

that the cause of the stoppage of the CVR and the FDR could not be conclusively determined and that

there was no evidence to explain the time difference of six minutes between the stoppage of the CVR

and FDR.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79.    Professor Howe agreed that there was no evidence to support

the plaintiffs assertion that the CVR and FDR had been intentionally disconnected. In para 8 of

his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Final Report [of the NTSC] indicates that the stoppage of the CVR was not

  due to a short circuit or overload. The Report accepts that both the CVR and the FDR may have

  stopped as a result of a loss of power supply. (In the case of the FDR, the possibility that the

  unit malfunctioned was also not ruled out.) While the NTSB has strongly suggested that the loss of

  power was due to manual interference, there is no real evidence to support this suggestion. The

  fact that the stoppages were not simultaneous has not been explained but it is not unreasonable to

  imply the possibility that a progressive power supply failure occurred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80.    SilkAirs counsel, Mr Lok, submitted that the fact that

the aircrafts transponders failed to work after the aircraft went below 19,500 feet indicated

that a likely cause of the stoppage of the CVR and FDR was progressive electrical failure. For the

aircraft to be tracked, its transponders had to send a signal to the radar station. As has been

mentioned, the aircraft was last tracked on the radar screen when it was at an altitude of 19,500

feet. As it was projected that the aircraft broke up while it was between an altitude of 5,000 to

12,000 feet, it should have been tracked on the radar screen a number of times before it broke up.

The radar equipment on the ground was not faulty and other aircraft in the vicinity were tracked at

the material time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81.    Mr Lok pointed out that the possibility that the aircrafts

transponders had no electrical power after the last recorded radar sweep at 19,500 feet was conceded

by Boeings Mr Ingham in proceedings in the United States. The following excerpts from his answers

to questions posed by some of the plaintiffs American counsel during those proceedings may be

borne in mind for the sole purpose of noting that the possibility of a loss of electrical power was

considered:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. So one of the scenarios that could explain the absence of a radar reply in

  the period subsequent to the time the aircraft was at 19,500 feet would be the loss of electrical

  power to the transponder, correct?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Thats a possibility.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. You talked about speculating why the radar didnt pick up the aircraft

  between 19,500 feet, and one of the scenarios could have been a loss of electrical power. Did you

  have any other scenarios that you speculated could have caused this anomaly?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Nothing that came to mind other than loss of electrical power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82.    Captain Laming disagreed that the failure of the

transponders was due to progressive electrical failure but conceded that this was a possibility.

When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Would [your opinion that there was no electrical failure] be changed by

  knowing now that the transponder stopped sending messages eight seconds after the last radar sweep

  at 19,500 feet?</p>
<p align="justify">A.  I wouldnt be surprised if [the transponder] did stop transponding. As

  I said, I think you are in an area which no person has ever flown before, so who knows what 

  occurring inside the cockpit, inside the boxes where the electrical equipment is. It is an area we

  never tested. I think we are in an area of complete unknown but I think to speculate that it is

  a progressive electrical failure, I dont agree. Thats only an opinion.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Would you agree that there would be a possibility of that?</p>

disabled for the purpose of concealing evidence, opined that if a pilot wanted to conceal any

evidence of his alleged misdeed, he would have crashed the aircraft into the open sea as that would

have concealed more evidence of his intention than a crash in Sumatra. Whether or not he is correct

need not be considered. All that needs to be said is that it was not established that the CVR and

FDR had been deliberately disabled. In fact, as far as the FDR is concerned, even Mr Job, the

plaintiffs expert witness, conceded that there was no evidence as to why it stopped recording.

Other possible causes of the crash</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84.    While arguing that there is no basis for a finding that

Flight MI 185 was intentionally crashed by pilot inputs in the cockpit, Professor Howe pointed out

that there could be other possible causes of the disaster, namely mechanical or electrical failure

and rapid depressurisation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85.    When considering whether or not mechanical failure could be

a cause of the crash, the NTSB suggested that the NTSCs Final Report state that "there was

no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure of any flight control PCU or actuator that either

caused or contributed to Flight MI 185s departure from cruise flight or the resulting

accident". However, the NTSC, which declined to rule out mechanical failure as a possible cause

of the crash, explained its position as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The evidence available does not rule out that there were no airplane-related

  mechanical malfunctions or failures as only 73% of the wreckage was recovered, most of which was

  highly fragmented. It is for this reason that NTSC has not made any conclusions on this. NTSC has

  taken the consistent position throughout the final report that conclusions must be backed by

  evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">86.    The NTSCs refusal to rule out mechanical malfunction as

a possible cause of the crash was endorsed by Professor Howe, who thought that mechanical failure

included the possibility of electrical failure.</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">87.    SilkAir maintained that the possibility of rudder failure

should not be excluded. Mr Lok pointed out that in proceedings in the United States against Boeing

and manufacturers of parts of the aircraft, the plaintiffs had alleged that the crash had been

caused by, inter alia, the main power control unit of the aircraft rudder.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">88.    As far as the question of rudder problems is concerned, the

NTSC stated its position in the following terms:</p>
<u xmlns="">

  Board Report and the FAA AD --- which recommends that ---, the NTSC is of the view that this

  section should not contain a conclusion statement on whether the rudder PCU was or was not a cause

  or contributing factor in the accident.<u xmlns="">
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">89.    Professor Howe did not discount the possibility of rudder

problems being a cause of the crash of Flight MI 185. He stated in para 9 of his affidavit of

evidence-in-chief as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[Mechanical failure] is certainly a possibility that has not been disproved.</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Final Report [of the NTSC] itself makes reference to issues raised with

  respect to rudder problems of B-737s in the aircraft accidents in Colorado Springs, Pittsburgh and

  Bournemouth. The Final Report indicates that thermal shock leading to rudder reversal arising from

  warm hydraulic fluid was unlikely in temperatures created during real flight; and that corrosion

  to the electrical and electronic compartment leading to uncommanded rudder movement was unlikely

  based on inspection of a sister SilkAir B-737. It has to be accepted that no positive evidence is

  present to prove rudder failure. Equally however, there is no evidence that conclusively excludes

  this possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">90.    Mr Khoo SC pointed out that if any rudder failure similar

to that which occurred in the Boeing 737 air crashes at Pittsburgh and Colorado Springs had been

faced by the pilots of Flight MI 185, the aircraft was at a sufficiently high altitude for it to be

steadied and recovered. However, Professor Howe said that the crash of Flight MI 185 might have been

due to another type of rudder problem altogether. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Im just reserving the position  that there might have been some other

  rudder failure which is not yet been revealed and may, hopefully never be revealed because maybe

  it wasnt there, but we might have the sad situation where in the future another 737-300

  disappears from cruise conditions under mysterious circumstances and maybe investigations would

  reveal, as it did at Pittsburg, that there was a problem.<br/>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">91.    As for the other suggested possible cause of the crash,

namely rapid depressurisation, Professor Howe conceded that it was very unlikely that there was a

complete cabin depressurisation. However, he added that a false warning of cabin depressurisation

could not be ruled out. This was endorsed by Captain Galan, who testified that of the range of

possible causes of the crash, this cause would be most likely while the pilots suicide would lie

at the opposite end of the range.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">92.    The possibility of an emergency descent as a result of

rapid cabin depressurisation was considered by the NTSC. It noted that the last pilot radio

transmission about two and a half minutes before the final descent of the aircraft was normal and

there was no mention of any in-flight fire or smoke. Furthermore, the wreckage revealed no evidence

of in-flight fire or explosion and it was ascertained that the recovered oxygen generators had not

been activated. Based on these findings, the NTSC concluded that there was no indication of an

emergency descent due to fire, smoke or rapid depressurisation. Both Professor Howe and Captain

Galan pointed out that not all the oxygen generators were recovered. Professor Howe said that it was

possible that there was no time or reason for those generators which were found to be activated. As

such, he stressed that it was wrong to rule out depressurisation or a false alarm of

depressurisation as a reason for the emergency descent which finally caused the aircraft to crash.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">93.    The evidence adduced does not justify a conclusion that

mechanical failure or rapid depressurisation caused the crash of Flight MI 185. All the same, the

discussion of other possible causes of the crash of the aircraft was useful, if only because it

showed how difficult it is to discharge the onus of proving the cause of the crash.</p>

E. HUMAN FACTORS AND SUICIDE</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">94.    The human factors relevant to the crash of Flight MI 185

will next be considered. That an investigation into the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185 must

take into account human factors with respect to the persons piloting the aircraft is evident. When

cross-examined, the plaintiffs expert witness, Mr Job, said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    Mr Job, would you agree that in any investigation of air crashes that the

  human factor element would be an important part of that investigation?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Certainly.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 737)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">95.    Captain Galan, who agreed that human factors must be looked

at when investigating the cause of the crash, explained:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I [have been] working [on] human factors [for] a long time, and we learn from

  the human factors that an accident does not start  at the exact time where the first technical

  or visible operation is done. An accident starts a long time before [that] very often. And we have

  to consider the behaviour of the crew before as facts  [to be considered as] evidence. So the

  accident for me does not start when somebody pull[s], push[es] on the stick or something like that

  but a [long] time before. [S]o human factors explain that the accident is not confined in this

  case [to] something like two minutes.<br/>

  (V/N pp 1072-1073)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">96.    In the present case, the human factors relevant to whether

or not the pilots had any intention to kill themselves and all other persons on board the aircraft

merit particular attention even though Mr Khoo SC reiterated on numerous occasions that the

plaintiffs did not allege that either pilot wanted to commit suicide. He said that the motive for

the intentional inputs to crash the aircraft was irrelevant. However, an assertion that there was

intentional tampering with the controls of an aircraft to cause it to crash, if proven, leads to the

conclusion that Captain Tsu and/or F/O Ward intended not only to crash the aircraft but also to

commit suicide and kill 97 passengers and all the other crew members. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC,

Captain Galan rightly said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Captain Galan, the fact remains, does it not, that the question of suicide

  must be separated from the manoeuvre itself?</p>
<p align="justify">A. . Im sorry. For me, somebody who pushed the plane down to the ground

  is [committing] suicide.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1129)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">97.    The plaintiffs expert witnesses conceded that a person

responsible for inputs such as those allegedly made in the cockpit of Flight MI 185 would know that

he was going to kill himself. In reply to my questions, Captain Laming said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Ct. What is the inevitable consequence of someone in the cockpit continually

  pressing the button for eight seconds?</p>
<p align="justify">A. If he presses the button by himself and does nothing in terms of the main

  control column, the aircraft will go into a dive. It probably would not recover.</p>
<p align="justify">Ct. Would a Boeing 737 pilot know that what he was doing would lead to a point

  where extreme aerodynamic forces would prevent recovery?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Most certainly.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Ct. <u>In other words, he would know that if he pressed [the button] and did

  nothing else, he was going to kill himself</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">A. <u>Yes</u>.</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">(V/N pp 296-298; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">98.    Despite strenuous efforts to distance himself from the

allegation of suicide, Mr Job finally conceded that the plaintiffs were in fact saying that the

person who controlled the aircraft at the material time intended to kill himself. When questioned by

me, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Ct.  [I]n your view, MI 185 came down because the person who manipulated the

  controls wanted to commit suicide and sadly, in the process, he became a mass murderer.</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes, I agree with that.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 784)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">99.    The thrust of the plaintiffs case is that it is more

likely than not that it was Captain Tsu who deliberately crashed the aircraft. All the same, as the

plaintiffs also asserted that F/O Ward could have been responsible for the inputs in the cockpit

which caused the crash, the human factors relevant to both F/O Ward and Captain Tsu will be

considered.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">100.    Mr Lok referred to the exhaustive investigation by

Singapores CID in its attempt "to trace any indication of possible suicidal intent on the

part of the pilot, co-pilot or the crew". More than 160 people in five countries were

interviewed by the CID, which concluded that after a careful examination and analysis of all the

materials obtained, it found no evidence that the pilot, co-pilot or any crew member had suicidal

tendencies or a motive to deliberately cause the crash of Flight MI 185.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">101.    Mr Khoo SC pointed out that as he had no opportunity to

cross-examine the CIDs witness, the findings of the CID should not be relied on by SilkAir. There

are sufficient findings by the NTSC on human factors and only these findings will be relied on in

this judgment.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

F/O Ward</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">102.    The human factors relating to First Officer Ward will

first be considered. F/O Ward, who studied aviation at Massey University, New Zealand, joined

SilkAir in September 1996, after having worked as a First Officer with Indonesias Garuda Airways.

During his re-training to fly the Boeing-737, he was rated as "above average". No problems

were noted during his training or during subsequent base checks in March and September 1997.

According to para 1.18.4.1 of the NTSCs Final Report, other SilkAir pilots described him as an

above average pilot with very good handling skills. Para 2.14.2 of the NTSCs Final Report added

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The investigation into  [F/O Wards] personal and professional history

  revealed no unusual issues. No records of incidents or unusual events were found, and no career

  setbacks or difficulties were experienced. Financial records showed no evidence of financial

  problems. Interviews with family, close friends and relations seem to indicate that the [First

  Officer] was a well-balanced and well-adjusted person, and keen on his job, and planning to

  advance his flying career. There were no reports on recent changes in his behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">103.    First Officer Lawrence Dittmer (hereinafter referred to as

F/O Dittmer), a colleague of F/O Ward and Captain Tsu, testified that F/O Ward was a gentleman. When

questioned by Mr Khoo SC about F/O Wards character, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Probably, the most honest person Ive ever met. Initially, you would perhaps

  perceive him as being quite shy. but once you did get to know him youll soon realise that he

  had some fine attributes, namely his honesty, his belief and loving life, . I think, you just

  got the feeling that he was a great guy to know. Hes very friendly with everybody; you knew

  that he had no grudges against anybody. I think you could just safely say that he was an all-round

  gentleman.<br/>

  (V/N p 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">104.    As for F/O Wards financial position, the NTSC noted

that while he owed his parents an amount of money for initial flight training expenses, this debt

was less than his savings and there were no reports of other debts. There was nothing suspicious

about his two insurance policies. One was purchased in 1992 while the other was a standard SilkAir

policy.</p>
<p xmlns=""> 105.    In short, there is no evidence whatsoever that F/O Ward intended to

commit suicide and kill every person on board the aircraft.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Captain Tsu</p></b><i>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">106.    Captain Tsu, a former captain in the Republic of Singapore

Air Force (hereinafter referred to as "RSAF"), joined the RSAF in 1975. He flew many types

of fighter and trainer aircraft and was a member of the RSAFs Black Knights aerobatic team. He

left the RSAF to join SilkAir in 1992. He was appointed Captain in 1996.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">107.    Captain Tsu was a family man. The NTSC noted that he left

the RSAF and joined SilkAir in 1992 in order to spend more time with his family. His co-pilot on a

number of occasions, F/O Dittmer, who gave evidence of his alleged breach of safety regulations,

agreed that he was a family man. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Can you tell us something of your appreciation of Captain Tsus basic

  character ?</p>
<p align="justify">A. .We discussed a lot of things together involving his family background,

  his life, his children. Basically, the opinion I got was that he was a family man, and I like

  that. I was planning to have children in the future . So he was a nice guy to talk to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N pp 131-132)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">108.    The plaintiffs asserted that Captain Tsus previous

breaches of safety regulations must be taken into account when determining whether or not the

aircraft was intentionally crashed. They also asserted that in the light of Captain Tsus breaches

of safety regulations, SilkAir should not have put him in charge of any flight. Although the

allegations of impropriety, when closely scrutinised, are not really relevant to the issue at hand,

they will be discussed for the sake of completeness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">109.    At this juncture, the following elucidation of SilkAirs

levels of disciplinary action by SilkAirs Chief Pilot, Captain Leslie John Ganapathy, in para 30

of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief ought to be noted:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There are various levels of disciplinary action which can be taken against the

  pilots. The most serious is termination of their employment. This is followed by a demotion in

  rank. The pilot can also be removed from his position of Instructor Pilot or Line Instructor

  Pilot. This is known as a de-appointment. The next less severe penalty is a severe reprimand,

  followed by a reprimand. If the Company feels that the act does not warrant a reprimand, they will

  give a letter cautioning the pilot. In very minor cases, we would just issue the pilots a please

  be more mindful letter. This is basically a reminder letter just to make them aware that they

  should be more careful in the future. Letters of caution and reminders usually do not have a long

  term impact on promotions or increments. It is also our practice in cases where it is felt that

  pilots do require some guidance in procedural or operational matters for them to receive

  counselling from the Management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">110.    Captain Tsu was involved in the following incidents, which

merited the attention of SilkAir:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) An incident regarding the landing of an aircraft at Manado on 3 March 1997

  (hereinafter referred to as the "Manado incident").</p>
<p align="justify">(b) An incident involving the disconnection of a CVR at Changi Airport on 24

  June 1997 (hereinafter referred to as the "CVR incident").</p>
<p align="justify">(c) An incident involving a return to Changi Airport after having taken off for

  Kunming on 20 November 1997 (hereinafter referred to as the "Kunming flight incident").</p>
<u><i>
</i></u></blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>

  The Manado incident</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">111.    On 3 March 1997, Captain Tsu was the commander of Flight

MI 274, which left Singapore for Manado. As the aircraft approached Manado, it was positioned too

high and was moving too fast to be able to land at the airport. In such circumstances, Captain Tsu

should have proceeded on a "go-around" before attempting to land. His co-pilot on this

flight, F/O Dittmer, testified that instead of taking this course of action, Captain Tsu took the

aircraft on "S turns" in an attempt to bring it down to a much lower altitude in order to

land. He added that there were quick rolls to the left and right and he was scared. Unable to

achieve his purpose, Captain Tsu then took the aircraft on a "go-around" before it landed

at Manado airport. F/O Dittmer said that Captain Tsu had promised to report the

"go-around" to SilkAir but did not do so. It is worth noting that no passenger filed a

complaint about the flight in question and that in his own reports to SilkAir regarding the

incident, F/O Dittmer did not mention that he was frightened by the "S turns".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">112.    Captain Galan said that an "S turn" may,

depending on the circumstances, be acceptable. When questioned by Mr Lok, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. . Can you give us your comments on "S bends" and "S

  turns"?</p>
<p align="justify">A. . If these turns are done in good conditions, like turns done in a normal

  flight, there is no matter that it could be a problem except that in certain airlines, in certain

  airports, it could be not useful for the other aircraft and for navigation. But if there is no

  problem for the other aircraft, why not, you increase your distance without any problem if you

  make safe turns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N pp 1033-1034)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">113.    Captain Galan also thought that F/O Dittmers evidence

on the "S turns" done by Captain Tsu lacked important details. When cross-examined, he

said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Mr Dittmer did not describe anything. He made a sign like that. You see,  I

  am  scientific. If you say to me a turn  was at a bend of 25 or 35 or 60 degrees  at a

  speed which was so and so and the altitude which was so and so, I would say to you if I would do

  that. But you say to me a manoeuvre that was described by Mr Dittmer and you say that if I did not

  describe something  saying it as a strange manoeuvre. I am sorry that I cannot give you an

  answer to something which is so inadequate.<br/>

  (V/N pp 1157-1158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">114.    In para 17 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, SilkAirs

Deputy Chief Pilot, Captain Anthony Leong, said that he and Captain Ganapathy interviewed Captain

Tsu and F/O Dittmer and made the following findings:</p>
<ul xmlns="">
<li>Captain Tsu did not take measures early enough to prevent the aircraft from ending up in a

    position on finals from which a normal landing could not be made. This resulted in a go-around.</li>
<li>Captain Tsu by not reporting the go-around in the voyage report or to Flight Operations

    department acted inappropriately. This resulted in the subsequent erasure of data that could

    have been used for an investigation.</li>
<li>First Officer Dittmer by not reporting the go-around in the voyage report or otherwise to

    Flight Operations department also acted inappropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">115.    As a result of the Manado incident, the Flight Operations

Management recommended that Captain Tsu be given a letter of caution for failing to maintain a

proper profile on the final approach to the airport and for not reporting the "go-around",

which was an unusual occurrence. As for F/O Dittmer, it was recommended that he be counselled on the

implications of not reporting to SilkAir matters that should have been reported. Before the letter

of caution was issued to Captain Tsu, the cockpit voice recorder incident, which is discussed below,

occurred.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The CVR incident</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">116.    On 24 June 1997, Captain Tsu and F/O Dittmer discussed the

Manado incident while they were in the cockpit of a SilkAir aircraft that was about to take off on a

flight from Singapore for Jakarta. Captain Tsu told F/O Dittmer that he was upset by what he had

heard from other crew members about the Manado incident. As a result of something which F/O Dittmer

said, Captain Tsu pulled out the CVRs circuit breaker in order to preserve the recording of the

conversation. As F/O Dittmer made it clear that he was not prepared to fly without the CVR in

operation, Captain Tsu, who wanted to have the CVR tape downloaded, requested for and was given

clearance to move the aircraft back to the gate. Subsequently, he changed his mind and reset the

CVR. After that, the aircraft took off and proceeded to Jakarta without any further incident. In

para 27 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Captain Leong said that he compiled a report of the

incident after consulting Captain Ganapathy. It contained the following findings:</p>
<ul xmlns="">
<li>Captain Tsu acted inappropriately by de-activating the CVR before flight.</li>
<li>Captain Tsus actions compromised the proper operations of the airline and served to

    intimidate F/O Dittmer who would have subsequently been unable to operate the flight in a

    settled state of mind.</li>
<li>Captain Tsus [intention] to return to the gate to download the voice recorder tape at the

    expense of and inconvenience to the passengers [and] delays to schedules  [was] definitely

    not in the interest of the Company .</li>
<li>Captain Tsus assertion that he had F/Os agreement to proceed without the CVR operating

    was denied by F/O Dittmer.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">117.    Captain Leong said that although the flight could have

been performed without a serviceable CVR, the Flight Operations Department took a serious view of

the incident and recommended that Captain Tsu be removed from his Line Instructor Pilot status with

immediate effect.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">118.    On 3 July 1997, Captain Leong wrote to Captain Tsu to

caution him with respect to his failure to act appropriately in the Manado incident. Captain Tsu was

also informed that as a result of the CVR incident, he was reprimanded and removed from his position

as Line Instructor Pilot with immediate effect. Captain Tsu was dissatisfied with the decisions. As

a result, an inquiry was held, at which three charges in relation to the Manado incident and the CVR

incident were made against him. In para 31 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Captain Leong said

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Defendants wrote to Captain Tsu on 15 July 1997, informing him that

  disciplinary proceedings at Company level would be instituted against him for three charges,

  namely:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul xmlns="">
<li>On 3 March 1997, while operating flight MI274, he did fail to take appropriate measures early

    enough to prevent the aircraft from ending up in a position on finals too high for a normal

    landing thereby resulting in a go-around;</li>
<li>Subsequent to the go-around incident involving flight MI274 on 3 March 1997, he did fail to

    report or otherwise disclose to the company the said incident, an unusual occurrence which, in

    the companys interests, should have been reported and documented; and</li>
<li>On 24 June 1997, while operating a public transport flight MI186, he did behave in a manner

    unbecoming of a Commander and contrary to the companys interests by deliberately rendering

    unserviceable equipment essential for the proper conduct of the said flight.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">119.    On 28 July 1997, the Inquiry Panel found that while the

first charge was not proven, the remaining two charges were proven. As such, Captain Tsu was

reprimanded for his actions and removed from the position of Line Instructor Pilot with effect from

28 July 1997.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Kunming flight incident</p></i>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">120.    On 20 November 1997, Captain Tsu was the commander of

Flight MI 916, which was scheduled to fly from Singapore to Kunming. On take-off, one of the

aircrafts engines did not achieve the target thrust. Shortly after taking off, Captain Tsu had

second thoughts about proceeding to Kunming. After discussions with an engineering officer, a joint

decision was made for the aircraft to return to Singapore. The aircraft, a Boeing 737, which had

just taken off, did not have a fuel dumping capability. As such, it exceeded the maximum landing

weight when it returned to Changi Airport. Such an overweight landing should have been recorded in

the Technical Log and Incident Report Form. However, Captain Tsu did not do so. For this

infringement, both he and his co-pilot received a "be more mindful" letter from SilkAir.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">121.    In relation to the overweight landing incident, the

plaintiffs made two points. First, they asserted that Captain Tsu acted recklessly when he took off

from Changi Airport without sufficient thrust. Secondly, they said that Captain Tsus failure to

report the overweight landing was a serious breach of safety regulations.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">122.    While Captain Baston thought that Captain Tsu had taken

off from Changi Airport with insufficient thrust in one of the aircrafts engines, Captain Galan

took a totally different view. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. In this case, we knew that even after fire-walling the engine, pushing the

  thrust completely forward, it was still below its take-off thrust?</p>
<p align="justify">A. It was still below the maximum take-off thrust but above the possible

  take-off thrust.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1159)</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Dont you think something should have been done to remedy this problem

  towards the insufficient thrust?</p>
<p align="justify">A. . You know that I call insufficient thrust a thrust which is

  insufficient. In this case, the thrust was sufficient because it was over the minimum thrust

  acceptable for its take-off. So the thrust was sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1162)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">123.    SilkAirs Chief Pilot, Captain Ganapathy, agreed with

Captain Galan. When cross-examined by Mr Khoo SC, he said as follows:.</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [C]aptain Baston  felt that the take-off which preceded the overweight

  landing incident was operationally flawed. Do you have any comments on that?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No, I dont agree with that at all. The power that was available on the

  engine that had the power shortfall that day was well above what was required as the minimum

  take-off thrust for the flight. And the aircraft was in no way, I would say, at risk. It was

  well within its capabilities of taking off and climbing out satisfactorily.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1499)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">124.    SilkAirs Deputy Chief Pilot, Captain Leong, also agreed

that Captain Tsu did not take off from Changi Airport for Kunming with insufficient thrust in one of

the aircrafts engines.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">125.    As for failing to report the overweight landing, Captain

Tsu said that he did not file a report as he thought that the landing had been smooth. Captain Leong

testified that in his view, this incident did not involve a breach of safety procedures. However,

Captain Baston thought that Captain Tsus failure to report the overweight landing should not be

viewed as an administrative oversight and that a smooth landing is not the criteria for determining

whether or not such a report should be lodged. He said that such a report is required so that an

airworthiness inspection can be conducted.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Effect of disciplinary action on Captain Tsu</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">126.    The effect of the disciplinary action taken by SilkAir in

1997 on Captain Tsus morale ought to be considered. The NTSC took note of Captain Tsus

employment record and said in para 2.14.3 of its Final Report as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">During his professional career at SilkAir, he was involved in a few

  work-related events, which were in general considered minor operational incidents by the

  management. However, in one particular event, for non-technical reasons, [Captain Tsu] infringed a

  standard operating procedure i.e. with the intention to preserve a conversation between [him] and

  his co-pilot, [he] pulled out the CVR circuit breaker, but [he] reset the circuit breaker in its

  original position before the flight. This was considered a serious incident by the management, and

  [he] was relieved of his LIP appointment. [He] was known to have tried through existing company

  procedures to reverse the management decision. Although there were some indications of [Captain

  Tsu] being upset by the outcome of the events, the magnitude of the psychological impact on [his]

  performance could not be determined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">127.    Captain Galan thought that Captain Tsus record should

not have caused him much concern. He said as follows in para 11(b)(iii) of his affidavit of

evidence-in-chief:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The only recorded work problems that concerned [Captain Tsu] were, based on my

  experience as a commercial pilot, minor disciplinary mistakes that should not have affected him

  much. Certainly, they do not appear serious enough for a man to contemplate suicide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">128.    Captain Galan said that those who worked with Captain Tsu

would have known if he was depressed. In para 11(b)(iv) of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he

explained:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">My personal experience with airline pilots is that a pilots nature of work

  brings him in such close contact with his fellow crew members that, if a pilot had been under any

  particular stress or was depressed, it would be impossible that this would go unnoticed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">129.    Captain Tsus recent behaviour was considered by the

NTSC, which stated as follows in para 2.14.3.1 of its Final Report:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[Captain Tsus] recent behaviour was analysed from statements made by family

  members, friends and peers during interviews. [His] family reported no recent changes in his

  behaviour. Work associates who observed [him] on the day of the accident and on his most recent

  flights, reported nothing odd or unusual in his behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">130.    Captain Ganapathy testified that his working relationship

with Captain Tsu remained cordial even after the latter was no longer a Line Instructor Pilot. He

added that after the loss of that position, Captain Tsu had friendly chats with him during

departmental meetings and social events. Referring to a meeting which he had with Captain Tsu a week

before the crash, he said at paras 44 and 45 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">44. . On or about 11 December 1997, Captain Tsu paid me a visit at my office

  as he wanted to discuss the letter sent to him on the overweight landing.</p>
<p align="justify">45. He firstly admitted that it had been an oversight on his part in failing to

  report the overweight landing. The meeting ended on a positive note and I believe that Captain

  Tsu was grateful to be given the opportunity to explain the incident and to receive from me the

  reassurance as stated above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">131.    In its thorough study of the human factors relating to

Captain Tsu, the NTSC considered his financial position at length. It found that Captain Tsus had

a "positive net worth" at the time of the accident. In para 2.14.3 of its Final Report,

the NTSC stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In the independent review of the NTSCs findings concerning financial

  background of [Captain Tsu] by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the available information in regard to the

  assets, liabilities, income, expenditure and share trading were incorporated into a net worth

  analysis. This analysis reveals the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul xmlns="">
<li>[His] net worth (known assets less known liabilities) deteriorated over the period of 1994 to

    1996, however it grew marginally during 1997.</li>
<li>Between 31 December 1994 and 31 December 1996 his known assets declined, while his known

    liabilities increased resulting in a net decline in the value of [his] known net worth.</li>
<li>Between 31 December 1996 and 19 December 1997, [his] known net worth increased again.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Analysis of the net monthly income available for discretionary and general

  out-of-pocket expenses, based on a monthly combined gross income (including [his] and his wifes

  salaries), indicated that [he] had a relatively minor monthly cash shortfall at around the time of

  the accident. This should be considered in [the] light of [his] positive net worth at the time of

  the accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">132.    Captain Tsus liabilities, and especially his losses on

shares, must thus be viewed in the context of his positive net worth at the time of his death. As

for his insurance policies, one included a mortgage insurance policy which was applied for in

December 1997. This is not an unusual policy and Captain Tsu did not know at the time of his death

that his application for the mortgage insurance policy had been approved. As for his other insurance

policies, they were effected many years ago and not under suspicious circumstances.</p>

NTSCs findings on human factors are helpful</p>
</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">133.    The findings of the NTSC on human factors are certainly

helpful. As such, they will be considered together with the evidence from the crash site and

simulation tests in the next part of this judgment in relation to whether or not the plaintiffs

contention that Flight MI 185 was intentionally crashed is justified.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

F. MY FINDINGS ON WHETHER THE AIRCRAFT WAS INTENTIONALLY CRASHED</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">134.    The plaintiffs task of proving that Flight MI 185 was

intentionally crashed is not an easy one in view of the paucity of evidence and the fact that their

case rested on circumstantial evidence. As for the plaintiffs assertion that the irresistible

inference is that the aircraft was intentionally crashed, it should be borne in mind that in <i>Caswell

v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd </i>[1940] AC 152, 169-170, where the precise nature in

which an accident occurred could not be ascertained, Lord Wright said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or speculation. There

  can be no inference unless there are objective facts from which to infer the other facts which it

  is sought to establish. In some cases the other facts can be inferred with as much practical

  certainty as if they had been actually observed. In other cases the inference does not go beyond

  reasonable probability. But if there are no positive proved facts from which the inference can be

  made, the method of inference fails and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">135.    Lord Wrights approach was endorsed by the Court of

Appeal in <i>Singapore Airlines Ltd v Fujitsu Microelectronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=60146&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 1 SLR 241</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">136.    The expert witnesses were sharply divided over the cause

of the accident and the veracity of some of the conclusions of the NTSC and the NTSB. In the face of

the dissenting views of the experts, many of the arguments advanced by Professor Howe and Captain

Galan are not unpersuasive.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">137.    To begin with, for reasons already stated, there is enough

room to question the accuracy of the projected flight trajectory of the aircrafts final descent

and the corrected radar data on which the flight trajectory was based. Both Mr Job and Captain

Baston accepted that with no other available data on the aircrafts descent into the Musi River,

the accuracy of the radar data relied on to reconstruct the flight path of the aircrafts final

descent had to be accurate. During the trial, no one seriously challenged Professor Howes

assertion that the projected flight trajectory of the aircrafts final descent and the corrected

radar points, if accurate, required the aircraft to achieve Mach numbers which are outside anything

that any of the witnesses said could be achieved by it. Only Captain Baston dealt with this issue

when he offered the view that wind flowing on parts of the aircraft could reach a speed of Mach 1 or

more but this did not affect Professor Howes assertion, which is that while the local airspeed

over parts of the aerofoil section could reach Mach 1, the speed of the aircraft would not exceed

Mach 1. (V/N p 1332)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">138.    As has been mentioned, the reliability of the corrected

radar data is being questioned by counsel for some of the plaintiffs in the present case in the

actions initiated by them in the United States against Boeing. Captain Baston was honest enough to

accept that his conclusions on the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185, which were based on the

flight trajectory of the aircraft and the simulation tests, could, depending on the margin of error

of the corrected radar data, change. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    In other words, if the radar data is shown to have been changed or amended

  in any way which subsequently is found to be incorrect, then there would have to be changes to the

  basis or the outcome of your opinion?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 479)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">139.    When questioned by me, Captain Baston confirmed that his

conclusions are only valid if the corrected radar data relied on by him are correct. (V/N p 543)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">140.    As for the simulation tests conducted by Boeing, the fact

that they were based on the controversial corrected radar data ought to be noted. This was made

clear in the NTSCs Final Report, which stated that the objective of the simulation tests

conducted by Boeing was "to explore and understand the various possible combination of one or

more malfunctions of flight controls, aircraft systems and power plants that would result in the

extreme descent flight trajectory as suggested by the radar plots<i>". </i>Apart from this, the

relevance of the simulation tests is debatable because such tests are of limited use when, as in

this case, the aircraft had exceeded its flight envelope.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">141.    There is also sufficient doubt as to what was the final

position of the jackscrew of the horizontal stabilizer before the aircraft started to disintegrate

in mid-air. The NTSC concluded that there is no evidence that intentional pilot input caused the

jackscrew of the horizontal stabilizer to be at its maximum forward trim limit. Furthermore, it was

not established that the pilots did not attempt to recover the aircraft from its unusual attitude.

The fact that the throttle was in a forward thrust position does not, without more, prove that that

the pilots did not attempt to recover the aircraft from its dive. It was also not established that

the CVR and FDR were intentionally disconnected.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">142.    I thus have no doubt that if one looks only at the

evidence from the crash site, the projected flight trajectory of Flight MI 185s final descent and

the simulation studies, the onus of proving that Flight MI 185 was intentionally crashed has not

been discharged.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Human factors</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">143.    In the light of my findings with respect to the evidence

from the crash site, the projected flight trajectory and the simulation tests, the human factors

relevant to the crash of Flight MI 185 have an added significance and will next be considered.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">144.    When considering whether or not Captain Tsu or F/O Ward

intended to commit suicide and kill the passengers and crew on board the aircraft, it must be borne

in mind that a finding that they intended to do so affects their reputation and character. In this

regard, the following words of Morris LJ in <i>Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd</i> [1957] 1 QB 247,

266-267 ought to be noted:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Issues may be raised in a civil action which affect character and reputation,

  and these will not be forgotten by judges and juries when considering the probabilities in regard

  to whatever misconduct is alleged. There will be reluctance to rob any man of his good name: there

  will also be reluctance to make any man pay what is not due or make any man liable who is not or

  not liable who is. A court will not be deterred from a conclusion because of regret at its

  consequences: a court must arrive at such conclusion as is directed by the weight and

  preponderance of the evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">145.    Morris LJ was of course echoing the approach enunciated in

<i>Bater v Bater </i>[1951] P 35, 36-37 by Denning LJ, as he then was, who said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is of course true that by our law a higher standard of proof is required in

  criminal cases than in civil cases. But this is subject to the qualification that there is no

  absolute standard in either case. In criminal cases the charge must be proved beyond reasonable

  doubt, but there may be degrees of proof within that standard.</p>
<p align="justify">As Best CJ and many other great judges have said, in proportion as the crime

  is enormous, so ought the proof to be clear. So also in civil cases, the case may be proved by

  a preponderance of probability, but there may be degrees of probability within that standard. The

  degree depends on the subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will

  naturally require for itself a higher degree of probability than that which it would require when

  asking if negligence is established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even

  when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature; but still it does require a degree of

  probability which is commensurate with the occasion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">146.    The evidence on human factors uncovered by the NTSC

provides no basis for concluding that Captain Tsu or F/O Ward intended to commit suicide and kill

the passengers and crew on board the aircraft. As far as Captain Tsu is concerned, it is important

to note that on the days before the crash and on the day of the crash itself, he showed no signs of

a change in behaviour. The recorded conversation in the CVR before it was disabled revealed that he

and F/O Ward chatted without any hint of tension or any sign that something ominous was to unfold a

few minutes later. The NTSC pointed out that the two hours of CVR information available for analysis

revealed cordial discussions between the two pilots which were unrelated to their work.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">147.    As for Captain Tsus financial problems, it should not

be overlooked that he had, in the NTSCs words, a positive net worth at the time of the accident.

Admittedly, he had some problems with his work but these were not serious enough to push him to take

his own life and the lives of so many other persons. As for the mysterious failure of the black

boxes, the NTSC stated in no uncertain terms that Captain Tsus act of disconnecting the CVR in

Changi Airport in June 1997 to preserve his conversation with F/O Dittmer with respect to the Manado

incident "had no bearing on this accident".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">148.    The NTSC also noted that Captain Tsu had forward planning

and that he was organising his fathers birthday party, which was scheduled for 21 December 1997,

just two days after the crash. It is unlikely that Captain Tsu, a family man who gave up his career

in the RSAF in order to spend more time with his family, and who was planning his fathers

birthday celebrations at the material time, would, without more, deny his wife a husband, his

children a much needed father and his aged father a son. Furthermore, even if it is assumed for one

moment that he wanted to commit suicide, it is unlikely that he would choose to distress his aged

father by killing himself and so many other people just two days before his fathers birthday

celebrations.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">149.    The plaintiffs case was focussed primarily on the

evidence from the crash site, the simulation tests and the disciplinary action taken by SilkAir

against Captain Tsu. Insufficient attention was paid to human factors relevant to the crash. While

Captain Laming and Captain Baston understandably concentrated on the technical aspects of the crash

because of their expertise, it cannot be fathomed why the plaintiffs third witness, Mr Job, an

experienced air crash investigator, did not cast his eyes further afield. After all, during the

trial, he reiterated on several occasions that attention should be paid to the human factors

relevant to the crash of Flight MI 185. Some of his answers during cross-examination are reproduced

below:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    Would [the CID report] be relevant to your consideration whether or not

  the CVR and FDR were intentionally disconnected? .</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes, it would be relevant.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Would [the CID report] be relevant to your consideration whether the cockpit

  crew set the plane on a nose-down trim?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes, it would be relevant.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 778)</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Looking at those [issues regarding other possible reasons for the crash] in

  the light of the CID report, if you were the investigator, would you want to be a little bit more

  careful and look a little bit more closely at those other issues?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes, I would, yes.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 787)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">150.    In view of Mr Jobs position, it is surprising that he

did not give the human factors which were considered at great length in the NTSCs Final Report

much attention. After all, he confirmed that whatever had been uncovered by the Singapore police had

also been considered by the NTSC. (V/N p 803) When cross-examined, he explained why he did not pay

much attention to the NTSCs findings on the issues considered by the Singapore police in the

following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. . Did you read these portions of the NTSC report?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Ive read them. <u><i>I understood that my brief was to concentrate on the

  operational aspects of the report. I didnt give them a great deal of consideration.</i></u></p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 803; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">151.    Mr Jobs admission that his brief was to concentrate on

the "operational aspects" of the report merits attention. What would have been his

conclusion if his brief had been to concentrate on the human factors relevant to the crash of Flight

MI 185? If this had been the case, would he have given scant attention to the evidence from the

crash site? As an expert crash investigator, Mr Jobs role was to look at all the relevant factors

and his testimony was undermined from the very start by his failure to give sufficient attention to

the human factors which he himself thought to be relevant to an investigation into the cause of the

crash of Flight MI 185.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">152.    Earlier on, I stated that the human factors relevant to

the crash of Flight MI 185 have an added significance because of my findings regarding the evidence

from the crash site and the simulation tests. The fact that there is no evidence that Captain Tsu or

F/O Ward intended to commit suicide or murder provides added reason for concluding that it was not

established that Flight MI 185 was intentionally crashed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">153.    In agreeing with the NTSC that there is no evidence that

the crash was intentionally caused by inputs in the cockpit, I have not adopted the NTSBs

conclusions. The NTSB is very experienced in aircraft accident investigation and its views merit

attention. All the same, it is not infallible and it has altered its conclusions on the cause of

some, albeit a limited number, of air crashes in the light of subsequent evidence which showed that

its original conclusions were wrong.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">154.    Captain Galan, who said that he had worked very often with

the NTSBs investigators, noted that he had sharp disagreements with the NTSB on two previous

occasions. He clearly did not agree with the conclusions of the NTSB on the cause of the crash of

Flight MI 185.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">155.    The plaintiffs expert witness, Mr Job, agreed that the

NTSB had been wrong in the past. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Do you agree that in UA Flight 811, [the NTSB] attributed the cause finally

  to something which they initially dismissed as having only remote possibility?</p>
<p>A. That is correct.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. And that similarly in the Colorado Springs incident, something which was

  initially dismissed as having only an extremely low likelihood was subsequently found to be the

  probable cause?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 717)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">156.    Mr Job also conceded that the NTSB could be wrong in the

present case although he thought this to be unlikely. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. . And youll agree that for all the good and best intentions of NTSB,

  they might possibly make mistakes in MI 185 as well?</p>
<p>A. As I have said before, anything is possible.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Do you agree with me that there is a possibility that somewhere out there in

  the wreckage that has still not been recovered, the answer to what actually happened to this crash

  may be found?</p>
<p>A. I can only answer that, again, anything is possible.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. And if that piece of answer is found, or if there is an improvement in

  technology, or if there is some sort of lesson to be learned from other mishaps, and an answer

  emerges a few years from now, the true cause will then be known?</p>
<p>A. It is possible.</p>
<p>(V/N p 717)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">157.    To be fair to the NTSB, its representatives did not

testify in this case. As such, many of the exacting questions posed by SilkAirs expert witnesses

in relation to its findings remained unanswered. On the basis of the evidence before me, the

plaintiffs have clearly not discharged the burden of proving that the aircraft was intentionally

crashed as a result of inputs in the cockpit by Captain Tsu and/or F/O Ward.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

G. WHETHER THE PILOTS WERE RECKLESS</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">158.    Whether or not SilkAir is barred from limiting its

liability in accordance with the provisions of the Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention on

the ground of recklessness on the part of the pilots will next be considered.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Position under the amended Convention</p></i>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">159.    The position under the amended Convention will first be

dealt with. The task which lies ahead of a plaintiff seeking to deny a carrier the right to rely on

the limitation of liability provisions in the amended Convention was outlined by Eveleigh LJ in <i>Goldman

v Thai Airways International Ltd </i>[1983] 3 All ER 693, 698 in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I say at once that, reading art 25 as a whole for the moment and not pausing to

  give an isolated meaning to the word recklessly, the article requires the plaintiff to prove

  the following: (1) that the damage resulted from an act or omission; (2) that it was done with

  intent to cause damage, or (3) that it was done when the doer was aware that damage would probably

  result, but he did so regardless of that probability; (4) that the damage complained of is the

  kind of damage known to be the probable result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">160.    In similar vein, in <i>SS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd v Qantas

Airways Ltd </i>[1991] 1 Lloyds Rep 288,<i> </i>302, Kirby P said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Even proof of reckless conduct is itself, and alone, not enough. It must be

  shown that, at the time of the reckless conduct, the servants or agents of the carrier concerned

  knew that such conduct would cause damage but went ahead regardless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">161.    In Singapore, the approach adopted in <i>Goldman v Thai

Airways International Ltd</i> and<i> SS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd </i>was endorsed

by the Court of Appeal in <i>Singapore Airlines Ltd v Fujitsu Microelectronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=60146&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 1 SLR 241</a>. Chao Hick Tin JA, who delivered the judgment of the court, said at p 251:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In our opinion, it is clear that the knowledge which must be proved is the

  actual knowledge of the wrongdoer, be it an individual or a group of individuals in a company. The

  fact that the amended Convention requires proof of recklessness as well as knowledge that damage

  would probably result, unmistakably indicates that recklessness per se is not sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">162.    The question of recklessness on the part of the pilots

would arise if they took the aircraft for a dangerous joy ride or if they did what Captain Flaming

described as "playing silly" in the sky. There is no proof that Captain Tsu or F/O Ward

did these acts. Whatever inappropriate act Captain Tsu may have done in the sky in the past, he was,

in the main, responding to a situation which required an input from him. He has never been accused

of taking passengers on board an aircraft for a joyride or on a frolic of his own.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">163.    The remaining question is whether or not Captain Tsu

and/or First Officer Ward acted recklessly when dealing with an unexpected situation or what they

perceived to have been a problem faced by the aircraft. Mr Khoo SC, who maintained that an emergency

descent is easy to execute, asserted that unless the pilots were incompetent or reckless, they could

never have got out of the flight envelope. He submitted that competent pilots such as Captain Tsu

and F/O Ward should have executed an emergency descent without difficulty unless they took reckless

steps, which caused the plane to exceed its flight envelope and crash. However, Captain Galan

stressed that there was no question of recklessness in this case. When cross-examined, he said as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [T]he other possibility of how the aircraft got into problems at exceeding

  the flight envelope is that he did it the wrong way.</p>
<p align="justify">A. He did the wrong way because the conditions were [such] that he could not

  do something else maybe.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Reckless? .</p>
<p align="justify">A. Not for me. No, no. No possibility of recklessness in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N pp 1130, 1132)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">164.    Professor Howe also said that the question of recklessness

on the part of the pilots did not arise. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. You see, if either the pilots had acted on instinct rather than act only

  after assessment of a situation, then they would have been wrong in executing the high-dive

  manoeuvre?</p>
<p align="justify">A. They would have been wrong, but not reckless.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. And I have to suggest to you, Professor Howe, that if they did something

  which was contrary to what they had been trained to do, that would be recklessness.</p>
<p align="justify">A. No, definitely not. Recklessness would only be if they were aware of the

  fact that they were doing something which was wrong and would put the aircraft and its occupants

  into danger.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1266)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">165.    Subsequently, Mr Khoo SC returned to the same subject but

Professor Howe, who steadfastly refused to concede that the pilots had been reckless, said as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q.    I would suggest to you  there would not have been this disastrous

  result unless someone had done it all wrong.</p>
<p>A.    Not at all. I would not accept that because we do not know the

  circumstances in the cabin of the aircraft, in the cockpit of the aircraft on the occasion. And

  I think to say at this stage that the pilots or pilot initiated an emergency descent and got it

  all wrong is really a gross assumption which cannot be justified by the evidence.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">166.    SilkAirs chief pilot, Captain Ganapathy, who knew

Captain Tsu quite well, also did not think that the latter would have been as reckless as alleged.

When questioned by Mr Lok, he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Well, it was one of the plaintiffs suggestions in this case that Captain

  Tsu was reckless in his operation of the plane and that somehow this might have led to the plane

  crash on the 19<sup>th</sup> of December, and what are your views on this?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I could not believe that that would be true. I knew him well and I cannot

  believe that he would have done something reckless.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1575)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">167.    When considering whether or not there was recklessness on

the part of either Captain Tsu or F/O Ward, it should not be overlooked that the time within which a

pilot responds to a real emergency may not be that taken during exercises in a simulator. Even

Captain Laming, who said that an emergency descent is not difficult to execute, agreed that

responding to an emergency in a simulator is quite different from dealing with a real emergency

while the aircraft is in the air. When cross-examined, he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Would you be able to replicate in a simulator the psychological pressure

  that a pilot may face in a real life depressurisation situation that the aircraft might crash or

  there might be a loss of lives if the situation is not rectified or would you consider that an

  irrelevant consideration?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I think its a difficult question to answer correctly. What I am saying is

  that in the simulator, there is a lot of --- theres a tense atmosphere. Theres a tense

  atmosphere because usually if you are training, thats fine. If you are under test, there is

  very tense atmosphere indeed or there can be. In terms of say how you are going to die, if you can

  have this dive, you know from prior knowledge, reading, the experience, that they may not recover

  from a certain angle but the simulator has limitations too. Its not a very good reply to you

  but Im trying.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Yes. The only thing I wanted to know is that do you consider that to be

  another difference between a real life emergency situation and a ... situation in a simulator?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes, there is a difference.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. So in addition to the physical changes, the physical differences in a real

  life depressurisation, there is also the psychological stresses which are present in a real life

  situation.</p>
<p>A. There would be.</p>
<p>(V/N pp 313-314)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">168.    Captain Galan agreed that Captain Tsu and F/O Ward had

been trained for an emergency descent but pointed out that while executing such a descent may appear

easy from a text book, the position is quite different when a pilot is faced with a real threat to

the aircraft and its passengers. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. [An] emergency descent was a simple manoeuvre to execute. What are your

  comments on that?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I dont agree at all . Emergency descent is, in fact, something which

  is very, very difficult. We had at the very beginning of the seventies to make an evaluation of

  the different tasks of the pilot in the commercial aircraft . All the tasks from take off to

  landing, all the tasks in normal and abnormal conditions. So we did this job during months and

  months with a subjective means, that means, we used pilots and we asked them how difficult was

  this task  but we also used the objective means in using devices coming from doctors. We used

  the measurement of the breathing, measurement of blood pressure, measurement of the

  electro-cardiogram and after some months, we  took different pilots from different airlines in

  simulators. We have to recognise that the emergency descent was one of the highest workload

  that we could meet in cases of problem in flight.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N pp 1024-1025)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">169.    Captain Galan added that the fact that there were two

pilots in the cockpit does not mean that an emergency descent would have been an easy manoeuvre.

When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. If there were two pilots, there shouldnt be difficulty in managing  a

  high dive, as you say, as opposed to one pilot?</p>
<p align="justify">A.  [I]f there are two pilots, its a heavy difficulty. With one pilot

  around, its an extreme difficulty but with two pilots, it is very difficult anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">(V/N p 1105)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">170.    Captain Baston also accepted that a pilots response to

a real emergency may be different from his response during an exercise. When explaining the element

of surprise and why a co-pilot may not have sufficient time to negate the effects of an errant pilots

deliberate manoeuvres to crash a plane, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">But I am talking about  reaction times. We have quick donning oxygen masks.

  We can just grab the mask, put it on. Now, in a simulated exercise, most people can get those

  masks on fairly quickly, or when you are sitting there checking them prior to flight. The FAA and

  the NTSB did a joint exercise back in the .. early 1980s, where they got normal line crew in a

  simulator, did not brief them, and where everybody was thinking that they have had them on in two

  to five seconds, the average time for an average pilot [in] a surprise event was 17 seconds just

  to get the oxygen mask off and put it on and start breathing oxygen, so that its very difficult

  to make objective assessments of reaction time in a courtroom without doing a full study in the

  aircraft.<br/>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">171.    After taking all circumstances into account, I hold that

it has not been established that Captain Tsu or F/O Ward acted in such a manner as to deprive

SilkAir of its right to limit its liability in accordance with the provisions of the amended

Convention.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Position under the Warsaw Convention</p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">172.    I now turn to the position under the unamended Warsaw

Convention, which requires the plaintiffs to establish that the damage in question was caused by the

wilful misconduct of either Captain Tsu or F/O Ward if SilkAir is to be barred from limiting its

liability.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">173.    In <i>Horabin v British Overseas Airways Corporation </i>[1952] QBD 1016, 1019-1020, Barry J explained the ambit of the term "wilful misconduct" in the

Warsaw Convention in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Wilful misconduct is misconduct to which the will is a party, and it is wholly

  different in kind from mere negligence or carelessness, however gross that negligence or

  carelessness may be .</p>
<p align="justify">In order to establish wilful misconduct, the plaintiff must satisfy you that

  the person who did the act knew at the time that he was doing something wrong and yet did it

  notwithstanding, or, alternatively, that he did it quite recklessly, not caring whether he was

  doing the right thing or the wrong thing, quite regardless of the effects of what he was doing on

  the safety of the aircraft and of the passengers for which and for whom he was responsible. That

  is something quite different from negligence or carelessness or error of judgment, or even

  incompetence, where the wrongful intention is absent. All these human failings  errors of

  judgment, carelessness, negligence or incompetence - may give rise to acts which in the judgment

  of ordinary reasonable people may amount to misconduct, but the element of wilfulness is there

  missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">174.    In similar vein, in <i>Thomas Cook v Air Malta </i>[1997] 1 Lloyds Rep 399, 408, Cresswell J had occasion to observe as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">What does amount to wilful misconduct? A person wilfully misconducts himself if

  he knows and appreciates that it is misconduct on his part in the circumstances to do or to fail

  or omit to do something and yet (a) intentionally does or fails or omits to do it or (b) persists

  in the act, failure or omission regardless of the consequences or (c) acts with reckless

  carelessness, not caring what the results of his carelessness may be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">175.    For reasons already stated in the discussion of proof of

recklessness in relation to the amended Convention, there is no evidence that the crash of Flight MI

185 resulted from wilful misconduct on the part of Captain Tsu or F/O Ward.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

H. CONCLUSION</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">176.    At the end of the trial, it was evident that the cause of

the crash of Flight MI 185 was not proven. In this regard, the following words of Lord Brandon in <i>Rhesa

Shipping Co SA v Edmunds and Another (The Popi M) </i>[1985] 2 All ER 712, 714 are instructive

although that case concerned the loss of a ship:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[I]t is always open to a court, even after the kind of prolonged inquiry with a

  mass of expert evidence which took place in this case, to conclude, at the end of the day, that

  the proximate cause of the ships loss, even on a balance of probabilities, remains in doubt,

  with the consequence that the shipowners have failed to discharge the burden of proof which lay on

  them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">177.    As the plaintiffs did not discharge the burden of proving

their assertions regarding the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185, SilkAir is not barred by the

Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention from limiting its liability with respect to the crash.

The plaintiffs claim against SilkAir is thus dismissed with costs.</p>
