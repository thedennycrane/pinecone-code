        Tan Siong Thye JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Plaintiff, Seow Hock Hin, was the Senior
                    Vice President, Sales, Futures and Options, of the Defendant, MF Global
                    Singapore Pte Ltd, from 2005 to 2011. The Defendant was in the business of
                    providing brokerage and brokerage-related services for customers trading in
                    products such as contracts for differences, leveraged foreign exchange and
                    bullion transactions, futures, options and equities. The Defendant’s
                    business collapsed and this caused widespread panic in the financial markets. On
                    1 November 2011 the Defendant went into voluntary liquidation and provisional
                    liquidators (“the Liquidators”) were appointed for
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff claimed for accrued bonuses
                    totalling US$224,624.19 which he alleged was due to him under his employment
                    contract with the Defendant. The Liquidators, however, rejected his proof of
                    debt on the premise that he was not entitled to these bonuses. The Plaintiff
                    then brought this claim to challenge the Liquidators’ rejection of his
                    proof of debt. I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim at the conclusion of the
                    hearing. He is dissatisfied with this decision and has filed a notice of appeal.
                    I now give my grounds of decision for dismissing the Plaintiff’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff alleged that he was entitled to
                    accrued bonuses under his employment contract with the Defendant. These bonuses
                    were related to the provisions for contingent events which did not take place
                    and had since been returned, <em>ie</em>, written-back, to
                    the Defendant. The Plaintiff sought to claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     US$124,624.19 which he alleged he was
                        entitled to by way of accrued bonus following upon the write-back by the
                        Defendant into its financial accounts of a sum of money which was previously
                        set aside as contingency for its own tax liabilities (“the Tax
                        Provision Claim”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     US$100,000 which he alleged he was entitled to by way of
                        accrued bonus a certain sum set aside by the Defendant as contingency for
                        bad debts (“the Bad Debt Provision
                Claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff submitted that the above sums
                    represented part of the bonuses which were purportedly declared by the Defendant
                    and had accrued in his favour prior to the appointment of the Liquidators on 1
                    November 2011. Hence these sums became due and payable to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Liquidators resisted the Plaintiff’s
                    claims on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Defendant had the sole discretion
                        to declare the amount of bonuses that were due to the Plaintiff. In this
                        case, the sums claimed by the Plaintiff as bonuses had not been declared by
                        the Defendant as the necessary approval by the Defendant’s executive
                        officers prior to declaration was not given; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff and his team were not
                        automatically entitled to such amounts deducted from the calculation of the
                        “net available bonus pool” (see [13] below) as bonuses once
                        such deductions were written-back into the Defendant’s financial
                        accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       These were the issues before the court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the Plaintiff’s employment
                        contract entitle him to the bonuses?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did the Defendant declare the bonuses in the
                        Plaintiff’s favour?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Plaintiff’s employment contract entitle him to the
                bonuses?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff’s claim must be premised on
                    his employment contract entered into with the Defendant on 29 March 2006. Clause
                    5 of his employment contract stipulated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The payment of such bonus is at the <em>sole-discretion of
                            the Company</em> and is only payable provided you are in the
                        employment of the Company on the <em>date it is
                            declared</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Therefore, it is very clear from clause 5 of the
                    Plaintiff’s contract of employment that the payment of bonuses is neither
                    a right nor an entitlement. Bonuses are payable at the “sole discretion
                    of the Company” and “on the date it is declared”. Hence if
                    the bonuses claimed in this case were not declared, the Plaintiff would not be
                    entitled to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There was another letter from the Defendant to
                    the Plaintiff dated 25 August 2011 which further indicated that the payment of
                    bonuses was entirely discretionary. The operative date for the bonus eligibility
                    in that letter was 1 October 2011. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Bonus Eligibility</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Company operates performance related bonus schemes for employees.
                        Under the Bonus Scheme in which you will be eligible to participate,
                            <em>bonuses will be determined on a discretionary
                            basis</em> and paid semi-annually (“Semi-Annual
                        Bonus”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Company <em>reserves the right to pay a portion of any
                            bonus payment</em> (or other incentive award, including the
                        Semi-Annual Bonus), in the form of long-term incentive vehicles (restricted
                        shares, units, options or other), in a manner consistent with Company
                        policies applicable to all similarly-situated employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the Court of Appeal case of <em>Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</em> [2000] 2
                    SLR(R) 30, the employee argued that he was entitled to a certain bonus even when
                    he had been dismissed by the company and the bonus was discretionary. The bonus
                    clause in that employee’s employment contract stated that “a bonus
                    may be paid to you at the end of each calendar year, based on Company
                    profitability and your performance during the year”. The Court of Appeal
                    interpreted this clause to mean that payment of the bonus was entirely at the
                    discretion of the company. The employee was correspondingly not entitled to the
                    bonus as it had not been declared. The Court of Appeal made the following
                    remarks at [71]–[72]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, it would be wrong to allow an employee in Latham’s
                        position to lay claim to a discretionary bonus on a proper construction of
                        his employment contract when his services were terminated even before his
                        bonus was properly declared. In both <em>Walz v Barings
                            Services Ltd</em>, a preliminary hearing before the English
                        Industrial Tribunal, and <em>Bajor v Citibank International
                            plc</em> (Queen’s Bench Division, 19 February 1998,
                        unreported), the plaintiffs were employed in an industry in which the
                        employees operated within a “bonus culture” in which bonuses
                        were very commonly and even invariably paid. However, both plaintiffs were
                        held not to be entitled to claim the bonus as a matter of contractual
                        obligation after being dismissed, even if they were wrongfully dismissed as
                        in the case of <em>Bajor v Citibank International
                            plc</em>. In <em>Walz v Barings Services
                            Ltd</em>, this was so even though the bonus had already been
                        announced by the respondents. It was held there that, as the bonus was
                        totally discretionary, there was simply no obligation to pay. Announcing it
                        did not convert the payment of the bonus into a contractual
                        obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Latham’s situation was akin to the plaintiffs in these two cases.
                            <em>Unless the bonus had been expressed to be guaranteed,
                            an employee in Latham’s position could not claim to be legally
                            entitled to a bonus, the granting and quantum of which are entirely at
                            the discretion of the employer</em>. While he might have hoped for
                        a bonus if he had indeed remained in the employ of CSFB, the fact remained
                        that, even then, he would not have been able to claim to be entitled to a
                        bonus as of right as it was entirely at the discretion of CSFB.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In this case, the Plaintiff also agreed at
                    para 10 of his affidavit dated 12 June 2013 (“the Plaintiff’s
                    Affidavit”) that his bonuses were paid at the “sole
                    discretion” of the Defendant. In the same affidavit, he explained that
                    the finance department would compute the bonus pool based on the percentage of
                    the net profit of his department. He would then allocate the bonus amongst the
                    people in his department including himself. This bonus allocation had to be
                    approved by other senior executive officers of the Defendant. Therefore, the
                    Plaintiff acknowledged that the declaration of a bonus had to go through a
                    system of calculation, allocation and, finally, approval from the Defendant.
                    However, he submitted that the bonuses which he sought had already been declared
                    and that he should, accordingly, be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Defendant declare the bonuses in the Plaintiff’s
                favour?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendant’s procedure for the computation of
                bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The next important issue is to determine
                    whether the bonuses claimed by the Plaintiff had been declared by the Defendant.
                    This would require an understanding of the system of computing bonuses which
                    forms part of the process undertaken for bonuses to be finally declared. The
                    affidavits of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief
                    Financial Officer (Asia Pacific) of the Defendant, Mr Rajendra Bhambhani and Mr
                    Jason Foo, respectively, explained the bonus approval system. They stated that,
                    in the ordinary course of business, the Defendant would consider in its sole
                    discretion whether or not to declare and pay a quarterly bonus to the Plaintiff
                    and/or his team members. This would be at the end of each quarter in a calendar
                    year. The employees had no right or entitlement to such bonuses unless there was
                    a declaration to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     To facilitate the Defendant’s exercise
                    of its discretion, a formula is used as a general guideline. At the end of each
                    quarter, the net profit earned by the Plaintiff's team would be calculated. This
                    would be the “net profit available for payout”. A percentage of
                    this “net profit available for payout” would then be identified as
                    the “gross available bonus pool”. This percentage was not fixed
                    and would vary across the years. From this “gross available bonus
                    pool”, certain deductions would be made to arrive at the “net
                    available bonus pool”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Plaintiff would then submit a proposal as
                    to how the “net available bonus pool” should be allocated between
                    him and his team members. This would be subject to the approval of the
                    Defendant’s Global Head of Futures and Options, Mr Gary Pettit (“Mr
                    Pettit”). However, even after Mr Pettit had approved the
                    Plaintiff’s proposal, the actual declaration of bonuses was subject to the
                    final decision of the Defendant’s CEO. The CEO is not bound by the
                    Plaintiff’s proposal in this regard and the actual bonuses declared may
                    vary from that proposed by the Plaintiff as they would still be subject to the
                    CEO’s approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the bonus of US$124,624.19 relating to the Tax Provision Claim
                declared by the Defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defendant had set aside a contingent sum
                    of US$491,913.95 for its Taiwan Branch for the financial year ending 31 March
                    2007. This sum was to cater for potential fines and withholding taxes which
                    might be imposed by the Taiwanese tax authorities from 2003 to 2006. After a
                    fine of US$76,500 was paid in March 2011, a sum of US$415,413.95 was
                    written-back in 2011 by the Defendant to its financial accounts. The Plaintiff
                    argued that he was entitled to 30% of the write-back which was his bonus of
                    US$124,624.19. He contended that the bonus was declared in his favour but
                    payment was deferred by the Defendant on the basis of potential tax
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, the evidence did not support the
                    Plaintiff’s contention. In fact, the Plaintiff had attempted to seek
                    approval from Mr Pettit and the Defendant’s CEO for the pay out of the
                    bonus in relation to the Tax Provision Claim. In an email to Mr Pettit and the
                    CEO on 26 April 2011, the Plaintiff stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    We paid a fine of USD76,500 in Mar 2011, and
                            because tax authority can only back-track tax delinquencies for up to 5
                            years, we would not be liable for any tax payments or fines for FY2003,
                            FY2004 and FY2005. As such, we have written back the remaining
                            provisions, amounting to USD415,413.95.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Previously, when we made the provisions, it
                            impacted the bonus pool, and the bonus of the Dept was affect [<em>sic</em>]. As such, now as we are writing back the
                            provisions, I am of the opinion that we should add the amount back to
                            the Net Revenue line of the Dept, so that it would benefit the bonus
                            pool for the Dept.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    
              <em>For your kind approval
                                please</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     If it was the Plaintiff’s case that the
                    bonus had been declared, why then did he still attempt to seek approval from Mr
                    Pettit or the CEO? There was no reason to do so unless he was of the belief that
                    the declaration of such a bonus remained subject to the approval of Mr Pettit
                    and the CEO. It is therefore evident that even the Plaintiff himself was of the
                    opinion that he was not entitled to such a bonus in relation to the Tax
                    Provision Claim without the approval of both Mr Pettit and the CEO. No such
                    approval was given in response to the Plaintiff’s email. Furthermore, in
                    an email on 30 October 2011, the Plaintiff requested Mr Pettit to approve the
                    addition of US$106,000 to his bonus pool. This US$106,000 was calculated on the
                    basis of 25.5% of the residual contingent sum in relation to the Tax Provision
                    Claim. Again, no approval was given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff’s foundation for the Tax
                    Provision Claim was that he used the method of calculation of bonuses in the
                    ordinary course of business, <em>ie</em>, the bonus formula
                    described above at [13]. This was his basis to justify his entitlement to the
                    bonus notwithstanding the fact that there was no approval given by the Defendant
                    and, correspondingly, no declaration. It must be emphasised that the declaration
                    of bonuses is at the sole discretion of a company unless guaranteed under a
                    contract of employment. In many instances, a company may adopt a general
                    guideline as to how to compute the quantum of bonuses to be declared in the
                    ordinary course of business. However, a company should not in any way be
                    fettered and bound by such guidelines. The economic climate is always changing.
                    Sometimes a company may experience a windfall and sometimes it may face a lack
                    of business. At other times, a company, such as the Defendant here, may even
                    face financial difficulties of such an extent that it eventually has to enter
                    into liquidation—a situation which cannot be described as being in the
                    ordinary course of business. The amount of bonuses declared by a company would
                    thus inevitably be based on a consideration of the economic climate and other
                    relevant factors and vary in the light of such changing circumstances.
                    Therefore, although a guideline as to bonus computation grants the employee a
                    degree of certainty as to the quantum of bonus he may receive, it should not tie
                    the hands of the company such that it can no longer depart from such a guideline
                    if the economic circumstances demand that it does so. If the company faces a
                    tightening budget it should be allowed to depart from such a guideline, even to
                    the extent of not declaring a bonus if necessary. Even if the sums in question
                    were part of the profits generated by an employee, such as in the case of the
                    Plaintiff here, it must be remembered that a company declares bonuses based on
                    the performance of the company as a whole and not the employee individually.
                    Hence, in this scenario, there was no declaration of the bonus as there was no
                    approval from the Defendant. Ultimately, while it is possible to calculate the
                    bonus in accordance with the bonus formula this exercise is fruitless without
                    the Defendant’s approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As for the Plaintiff’s calculation of
                    the bonus accrued under the Tax Provision Claim, this was derived as a
                    percentage of the “net available bonus pool”. This percentage was
                    not fixed and was determined by the Defendant. In fact, in his email to Mr
                    Pettit, he indicated the percentage as 25.5% of US$415,413.95 which is
                    US$106,000 for his team while his claim in court of US$124,624.19 is premised on
                    30%. Hence he was not certain of the percentage himself as the Defendant did not
                    have a fixed percentage. As the Plaintiff stated at para 18 of the
                    Plaintiff’s Affidavit:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Throughout my employment, my bonus was calculated as a percentage of the
                        net profit of my department. For the earlier period, the bonus was set at
                        20% of the net profit whilst in later years my bonus was set at 25% or 30%
                        of the net profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Thus when the Plaintiff calculated his bonus for the Tax
                        Provision Claim he was unsure as to whether it was to be calculated on the
                        basis of 25.5% or 30%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The very fact that the percentage in question
                    was not fixed and was to be determined at the discretion of the Defendant is
                    further evidence that the amount claimed by the Plaintiff under the Tax
                    Provision Claim cannot automatically accrue upon a write-back. It remained for
                    the Defendant to determine the exact percentage of the residual contingent sum
                    to be included in the “gross available bonus pool”. There was no
                    such determination in this case and this explains why even the Plaintiff
                    deviated in his position as to what percentage of the residual contingent sum he
                    intended to claim. This again indicated that no bonus had been declared by the
                    Defendant. Thus there was no basis for the Plaintiff to claim the sum of
                    US$124,624.19 under the Tax Provision Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the bonus of US$100,000 relating to the Bad Debt Provision
                declared by the Defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Plaintiff argued that the Bad Debt
                    Provision Claim had been previously declared by the Defendant in his favour.
                    However, the payment was held back by the Defendant to provide for potential bad
                    debts. The only evidence referred to by the Plaintiff was the Quarterly Payout
                    for October 2008 which showed a bad debt reserve of US$100,000. This does not
                    indicate whether this sum was declared as a bonus by the Defendant upon the
                    Defendant’s approval. The Defendant, on the other hand, submitted that
                    this sum was not declared in the Plaintiff’s favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As explained by the Defendant’s CEO in
                    the procedure above at [13], during the computation of the bonus to be declared,
                    certain deductions would be made from the “gross available bonus
                    pool” to arrive at the “net available bonus pool”. One such
                    deduction would be the sum required for maintaining a bad debt reserve. The
                    Defendant had a practice of having a bad debt reserve for each team. In
                    computing the “net available bonus pool” for each team, 15% of
                    each team’s “gross available bonus pool” in each quarter was
                    deducted over the years to arrive at the “net available bonus
                    pool” for that quarter. Once the bad debt reserve reached US$100,000, no
                    further deductions were made unless the Defendant decided to increase the
                    provision beyond this sum. When declaring the respective bonuses, the Defendant
                    only considered the “net available bonus pool” after the deduction
                    of amounts to be used for contribution into the bad debt reserve and not the
                    “gross available bonus pool”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Hence, the sums set aside for bad debt cannot
                    be considered as accruing automatically or as having been declared in the
                    absence of approval. Furthermore, the affidavit of one of the Liquidators, Mr
                    Bob Yap, dated 18 July 2013 at para 15(d) also stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t was never a policy or practice of the Company nor was there
                        any agreement between the Company and the Plaintiff (and his team members)
                        that amounts which were deducted by way of “bad debt reserve”
                        in arriving at the “net available bonus pool” would vest in or
                        be paid to any of them at any time (including, in particular, if such
                        “bad debt reserve” turns out to be unutilised) or treat any
                        part of such “bad debt reserve” as prospective or contingent
                        bonuses vested in them …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Both claims were not declared by the Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There was no evidence to suggest that the
                    bonuses relating to the Tax Provision Claim and the Bad Debt Provision Claim
                    were declared by the Defendant. No approvals were given by Mr Pettit or the CEO.
                    Their approvals were necessary for bonuses to be declared. The Plaintiff has
                    failed to prove these vital facts on a balance of probabilities. In <em>Tan Hup Thye v Refco (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in members’
                        voluntary liquidation)</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1069, the managing director
                    in that case claimed for his bonus accrued to him after the voluntary winding up
                    of the company. The company refuted the claim. Judith Prakash J decided against
                    the managing director and said at [64]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence also showed that far from simply determining what bonus was
                        payable according to the Bonus Formula and paying that sum out after the end
                        of each financial year, the plaintiff invariably sought Mr Bennett’s
                        approval. At trial, the plaintiff admitted that he sought such approval from
                        Mr Bennett in the latter’s capacity as the representative of Refco
                        Inc. At the end of each financial year, the plaintiff would write to Mr
                        Bennett seeking his approval before the specific bonus amounts were paid
                        out. The plaintiff also admitted that over the period from 1996 to 2005, he
                        had consistently sought approval from the defendant’s shareholders to
                        pay bonus<em>. If the plaintiff and the other employees of
                            the defendant had been contractually entitled to bonus, there would have
                            been no need to seek approval for payment of the same.</em> This
                        evidence also established that the amount of bonus to be paid by the
                        defendant had to be approved, ultimately by Mr Bennett; it was not fixed by
                        the Bonus Formula. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Similarly, in this case, the Plaintiff had to
                    show that the bonuses were declared by the Defendant. Such declaration must be
                    premised on the approvals of Mr Pettit and the CEO in order for the Plaintiff to
                    succeed in his claim. This was not proven and, as explained, there was no reason
                    why the bonuses claimed by the Plaintiff could accrue automatically as a result
                    of the bonus formula only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claimed amounts did not solely represent the Plaintiff’s
                bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is, therefore, clear that the Plaintiff was
                    not entitled to the bonuses under both the Tax Provision Claim and the Bad Debt
                    Provision Claim. However, I further noted that the sums claimed by the Plaintiff
                    did not solely represent his bonuses. Rather, they were his entire team’s
                    “net available bonus pool” which was to be distributed amongst him
                    and his team members. This was admitted by the Plaintiff. As described by the
                    Plaintiff at para 20 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit, he was to provide the
                    proposed final allocation of such sums to Mr Pettit for approval. In this case,
                    no such proposal was provided and no allocation was approved by Mr Pettit. The
                    Plaintiff adduced no breakdown as to the allocation of the bonuses claimed by
                    him between him and the other members of his team. Furthermore, in his email
                    dated 26 April 2011 to Mr Pettit and the Defendant’s CEO in relation to
                    the Tax Provision Claim, he stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Previously, when we made the provisions, it impacted the bonus pool, and
                        the bonus of the Dept was affect [<em>sic</em>]. As
                        such, now as we are writing back the provisions, I am of the opinion that we
                        should add the amount back to the Net Revenue line of the Dept, so that it
                            <em>would benefit the bonus pool for the Dept</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is apparent that by referring to his
                    department instead of himself, and by viewing the benefit to be for the entire
                    department instead of himself, the Plaintiff was aware that the sum claimed
                    under the Tax Provision Claim was intended for his whole team and not just
                    himself only. Likewise, the bad debt reserve was maintained via deductions from
                    the entire team’s “gross available bonus pool”. Hence the
                    Bad Debt Provision Claim should also not accrue to the Plaintiff
                alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This was an action taken out by the Plaintiff.
                    He should have indicated his share of the bonuses. Instead, he claimed for the
                    entire amount including bonuses which, assuming that they had accrued, should
                    have been paid out to his team members who were not parties to the action. This
                    crucial information was not disclosed in any of his affidavits. Even the
                    Plaintiff’s lawyer stated at the hearing that he was unaware that the sums
                    claimed were for the whole team and that he was instead under the impression
                    that these sums belonged solely to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had in fact
                    attempted to claim for a large sum of money when he should have done so only for
                    a smaller sum, the difference of which did not belong to the Plaintiff but to
                    his team members.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In summary, the payment of bonuses was at the
                    sole discretion of the Defendant. The Plaintiff did not have an automatic or
                    contractual entitlement to the bonuses. The Plaintiff had failed to prove on the
                    balance of probabilities that the bonuses were declared by the Defendant. I
                    therefore dismissed his claim with fixed costs.</p>
