At the time of the offences, the Victim was between 11 and 13 years old. The Prosecution relied heavily on the Victim’s testimony, which it argued was consistent with the evidence of her mother (who is the ex-wife of the Accused, hereinafter “the Mother”) and of the medical experts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Accused wholly denied the occurrence of these incidents. Counsel for the Accused submitted that the Victim’s and the Mother’s testimonies were inconsistent in several material aspects, and their purported evasiveness on the stand suggested the possibility of fabrication. Further, at the material time of the offences, the Accused suffered from a penile deformity as a result of botched penile enlargement procedures, which made sexual intercourse painful and difficult for him. The Prosecution’s case was thus said to be inherently improbable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having considered the evidence, I found the Victim’s testimony to be unusually convincing and largely unshaken in court. I also preferred the evidence of the Victim and the Mother in relation to the appearance and condition of the Accused’s sexual organ during the material period. Accordingly, the Accused was convicted on all ten charges and sentenced to a global term of 23 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, and 24 strokes of the cane. The Accused has appealed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Accused is a 43-year-old male who has been engaged in various odd jobs since 2002. He married his ex-wife (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Mother) in September 1999. At the time of the offences, he was residing with the Mother, their three children, and a domestic helper in a flat located at Choa Chu Kang. The Victim is their eldest daughter, and is 16 years old as at the date of these grounds (date of birth: 24 November 2000). She was between 11 and 13 years of age at the time of the offences between the end of 2011 and April 2014.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Accused claimed trial to all ten charges brought against him for a series of alleged sexual offences committed against the Victim: </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">First Charge </div></td><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">… sometime at the end of 2011, at [address], did commit an indecent act with [the Victim], a child who was then about 11 years old, to wit, by taking her hand and swiping her hand across your penis, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38, 2001 Rev.

The Prosecution also applied for a gag order under s 8(3) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) in relation to the Victim’s identity, and for the Victim’s evidence to be given <span class="font-italic">in camera</span> under ss 153(1) and/or (3) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed).

</div> According to the Victim, the Accused would beckon her over to the toilet of the master bedroom, ask her to kneel, and then insert his penis into her mouth. This occurred about ten times in that year, with the first incident happening when she was in early Primary 6, and the last of them a year later before she started Secondary school. For most of these incidents, the Accused did not ejaculate into the Victim’s mouth. The Victim would, however, observe a white colour liquid, which she believed was his sperm, coming out from his penis after the oral penetration.

The Defence posited that the entire account had been a fabrication by the Mother and the Victim, motivated by the Mother’s desire to get a divorce from the Accused and/or because the Accused had harshly scolded the Victim and the Mother prior to the disclosure.

</div>
</div> There were various other inconsistencies in the Victim’s testimony which warranted the Court disbelieving her evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Having scrutinised her evidence, I found the Victim’s evidence detailed, coherent, and largely consistent both internally and externally. She was not shaken on the stand and was able to give an account that was cogent in respect of the main particulars of the charges. There may have been inconsistencies between her testimony and the medical reports, but taken in context those were not material and were explicable on grounds not related to her credibility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In particular, I preferred the Victim’s evidence, as corroborated by the Mother, as to the state of the Accused’s penis during the material period. Sufficient opportunities existed for the offences to have been committed in the family residence, and to have remained undetected, during the material period. I was also not persuaded that the Mother and the Victim had been in cahoots to frame the Accused because of their deteriorating marital relationship or because he had scolded them harshly. The Mother’s reaction to the Victim’s disclosure and her delay in reporting the abuse to the authorities were explicable on grounds that did not detract from the Victim’s credibility. Accordingly, I found the Victim’s evidence to be unusually convincing, and the Accused was convicted on all ten charges at the conclusion of the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As for sentencing, the Accused was sentenced to a global term of 23 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. This consisted of three sentences consecutively run: the fourth and sixth charges under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) (on sexual assault by penetration of a minor under the age of 14) for 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes each (these would have been 15 years’ and 12 strokes but for the totality principles), and the tenth charge under s 354(2) of the PC (on outrage of modesty of a minor under the age of 14) for 3 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes. Caning was capped at the maximum of 24 strokes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The commission of the offences </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The legal standard</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 There was no objective evidence available in the present case; all turned on the Victim’s testimony as against that of the Accused, taken in the context of the surrounding circumstances, including what was disclosed by the Victim to the Mother eventually, and the circumstances of the household. In these circumstances, I should not convict unless I find on a close scrutiny that the complainant’s evidence is unusually convincing (see <span class="font-italic">AOF v PP </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]). Relevant considerations include (i) the complainant’s demeanour in court, (ii) the internal consistency of his or her evidence, and (iii) its external consistency when assessed against extrinsic evidence such as the evidence of other witnesses or documentary evidence or exhibits (see <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [115]; <span class="font-italic">Farida Begam d/o</span><span class="font-italic"> Mohd Arthan v PP</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 592 at [9]), although the modern judicial tendency appears to lean in favour of relying more heavily on the last two inquiries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 If the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, a conviction would be unsafe unless there is adequate corroboration of the complainant’s story (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]). Subsequent statements by the complainant herself constitute corroboration so long as that statement implicating the accused was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence (see <span class="font-italic">PP v Mardai</span> [1950] MLJ 33 at 33; <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [173]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the present case, the Victim was generally able to give details of the various incidents, indicating what had allegedly been done by the Accused. Although there was a lack of clear particulars about the date and time of the incidents, this is commonplace where the alleged offences span a period of time, which is, unfortunately, the norm in many instances where similar allegations of sexual abuse are made in the familial context. Further, despite her young age, the Victim could give age-inappropriate descriptions of an entire range of sexual acts, and could further testify as to the Accused’s habitual use of olive oil as a lubricant in his various sexual acts.

</div> The Defence questioned Dr Pathy’s report on the ground that it referenced only the Victim’s nightmares of the Accused asking her to perform fellatio on him, and not any nightmare of her physically fighting back against the Accused, to which the Victim had testified in court.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I accepted that there were some inconsistencies between the Victim’s evidence and the contents of the two reports. In particular, unlike the discrepancy highlighted <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Dr Pathy’s report, the omissions and inaccuracies in Dr Krishnamoorthy’s report could not be said to be immaterial as they related to the constituting facts of several charges. For ease of reference, Dr Pathy and Dr Krishnamoorthy are hereinafter referred to as “the assessors”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 However, these reports must be taken in their proper context. First, the primary purposes of the reports had been to determine the Victim’s physical and mental states and her fitness to give testimony, rather than to obtain a full and complete set of facts surrounding each of the offences. This would naturally render the focus and content of their reports different from that of the Victim’s statements and testimony. Secondly, I accepted the Victim’s explanation that she had predominantly been responding to the assessors’ questions and prompts. Some discrepancies between the reports must thus be anticipated given that different assessors may ask questions of different issues and with different nuances; they may also choose to reflect in their reports different aspects of the information obtained and focus on different facts. Thirdly, I found persuasive the Victim’s explanation that she had not considered it necessary to recount the factual particulars of the abuse in exacting detail to the assessors, given that she had already given several statements about the same to the police.

For instance, in relation to the reference to penile-anal penetration on 15 April 2015 in Dr Krishnamoorthy’s report which was not captured elsewhere, the Victim responded that this was likely a miscommunication. She had intended to convey that the Accused had <span class="font-italic">attempted</span> penile-anal penetration <span class="font-italic">on that particular day</span>; any impression that the Accused had <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> effected such penetration was inadvertent.

</div> As for Dr Krishnamoorthy’s statement in the report that the Victim “denied any finger penetration or other forms of sex”, the Victim explained that this was likely to have been based on her response to Dr Krishnamoorthy’s question which was not generally framed, but rather, focussed specifically on the events that occurred on 15 April 2014.

Nevertheless, based on the evidence that was before me, I did not consider that the discrepancies and omissions in either medical report were so inexplicable or significant as to detract from the Victim’s credibility. Indeed, the context in which these discrepancies and omissions arose must be considered: these were reports prepared based on responses given by a 13-year-old to questions concerning a protracted series of abusive conduct that were put to her by stranger-assessors approaching the matter with different perspectives. When viewed against this backdrop, it was clear that the discrepancies between the reports and the Victim’s own evidence were better explicated on grounds other than the Victim’s deliberate fabrication or lack of credibility. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Opportunity for undetected abuse </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Victim gave evidence that there was opportunity for the offences to have been committed in the family residence undetected over the material period.

In this regard, the Victim and the Mother had given sufficient evidence of the family’s habits and practices, and these were such that the Victim and the Accused would ordinarily be left alone if they were in the master bedroom or any other room of the residence and the door was closed.

Therefore, taking the established familial culture into consideration, it was not in any sense incredible for the family not to have suspected anything untoward based on the fact that the Victim and the Accused were alone in a locked room. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">State of the Accused’s penis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Defence, relying on photographs of the Accused’s penis taken in October 2016, described the state of the Accused’s penis as “deformed” and relied on it for two reasons. First, it sought to argue that the large penile circumference measuring around 25cm at the maximum rendered it highly improbable for the Accused to have had penile intercourse with the Victim.

</div> I did not find that this sequence meant that her evidence should be rejected or given less weight; her testimony was consistent throughout. Indeed, there remained substantial differences between the Victim’s drawings and the Accused’s photographs in relation to the critical issues of the penile length and the relative size of the bulbous growth. If the Victim had intended to tailor her evidence, her drawings would not have assisted her fabrication. It should also be noted that the Victim’s drawings were produced after questions had been asked of her on whether she had seen the Accused’s penis in an erect state;

That left his testimony, which I found to be inconsistent, unreliable, and incapable of belief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 First, the Accused’s account of his ability to have sex after the enlargement procedures was wholly different at trial as compared to his initial statements. At trial, the Accused testified that after the third penile enlargement procedure in 2009, sexual intercourse between him and the Mother decreased in frequency as his penis had become extremely large and started swelling and collecting pus. During this time, the penis also became “deformed” and out of shape, and the penile skin started peeling off.

We discussed and I even went to Johore to enlarge my penis. After the treatment, [the Mother] told me that she enjoyed the sexual session with me. She ever told me that before the treatment she did not feel anything. I did the penis enlargement for 3 times where collagen was injected on my penis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Secondly, the Accused could not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why he had not sought corrective procedures or medical attention after his penile deformity arose in 2008 or 2009.

The Accused’s consistent evidence in his statements and in court had been that his three penile enlargement procedures were collagen-based.

</div> These collagen-based procedures could not have given rise to permanent results due to the natural reabsorption of the injectable; they thus deflated time and again after the first and second procedures. However, the Accused claimed that his third procedure enlarged the circumference of the proximal penile shaft to 25cm and resulted in a lasting deformity of at least seven years. This was contradictory to his own experience and Dr Lee’s testimony that a collagen insertion in 2009 could not possibly have caused the Accused’s penis to swell to a circumference of 25cm without resolution, and was unlikely to have resulted in the state of his penis as photographed in October 2016.

His penile deformity, and the implausibility and difficulty of penile intercourse as a result thereof, were raised in none of these statements. Rather, the first instance of the Accused raising the issue of his penile deformity was on 15 April 2016, some two years after his first statement was taken, when his Case for the Defence was filed.

This was particularly so given that the cautioned statements under s 23 of the CPC had been taken in September 2015, which was a year and a half after his first statement was taken on 15 May 2014. The Accused had, since that very first statement, been explicitly informed of the Victim’s serious allegations of sexual assault against him, which he described as “a big slap” to him.

</div> The intervening period thus gave him ample time to reflect on the facts and defences that should be raised to the investigation officers, and whether he had inadvertently missed any salient issues in his earlier interviews.

</div> I was not persuaded. The Accused had given several statements detailing sensitive and personal aspects of his life. For instance, in the further statement dated 25 November 2014, the Accused unabashedly elaborated on the Mother’s varying willingness to have sexual intercourse with him at different periods, and explicitly referred to his going to Johore three times for penile enlargement procedures in order to boost their sexual experience. Further, the Accused knew that the allegations were serious. His penile deformity was clearly relevant and would have undermined those serious allegations. Taking into account these considerations, I could not accept the Accused’s explanation that the mere fear of embarrassment had caused him to delay mention of his penile deformity.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Accused’s second explanation was that he thought his initial disclosure of his penile enlargement procedures to an investigating officer sometime in May 2014 meant that the police would know it was improbable for him to effect penile penetration of the Victim.

</div> I did not accept this. Even accepting his account of this initial disclosure, it did not follow that anyone would have been able to anticipate the fact of his penile deformity, or his submission on the implausibility of ordinary intercourse. Indeed, if he had genuinely believed that the police already knew of his penile deformity, it would be more than curious that his later statements, including the ten cautioned statements, made no mention at all of this deformity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For these reasons, I did not accept the Accused’s explanations for his belated disclosure of the exculpatory fact of his penile deformity. Accordingly, an adverse inference was drawn against him, and his account as to the state of his penis during the material period of the offences was disbelieved. In this regard, the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 157, which was decided in the context of s 123(1) of the former CPC (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), remains applicable to the new s 261(1) of the CPC (at [19]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If… the fact or circumstance that is withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or circumstance. This accords with common sense – if an accused believes he is not guilty of an offence that he might be charged with, he would be expected to disclose why he has such a belief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 A final clarification must be made. As a matter of law, there appear to remain some debate as to whether an adverse inference under s 261(1) of the CPC could be drawn from omissions in statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC that were not preceded by any caution or notice under s 23 of the CPC (see <span class="font-italic">Pinsler</span><span class="font-italic"> on Evidence</span> at para 5.058). As this issue does not arise squarely on our facts, and was not argued by the parties, it should be dealt with in a more appropriate case. For the avoidance of doubt, in this present case, the adverse inference was drawn from the omission of reference to the penile deformity in the ten cautioned statements taken under s 23 of the CPC on 4 September 2015, and not the prior long and further statements taken under s 22 of the CPC. The content and context of these prior s 22 statements, however, remained relevant to the extent that they influenced the persuasiveness of the Accused’s explanations for his omissions in the s 23 cautioned statements.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Other arguments</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Defence argued that it was a gap in the Prosecution’s case that the state of the Accused’s penis had not been ascertained as at the time of his arrest.

</div> I did not accept this. It would perhaps have made it easier for the Prosecution if they had done such an assessment and obtained incontrovertible evidence regarding the state of the Accused’s penis at that time, but the Prosecution was not under an obligation to do so, and no inference can be drawn against the Prosecution for not pursuing every potential defensive argument however fanciful or inconceivable they may be. It was the Accused who belatedly put the state of his penis in issue. The Defence’s own evidence of the Accused’s penile deformity was a set of photographs taken in October 2016, more than two years after the Accused had given his first statement in relation to the case. At the end of the day, both the Prosecution and the Defence had to take the evidence as it stood at trial and make their best possible case, even if that was made more difficult by the lack of contemporaneous evidence as to the state of the Accused’s penis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Finally, the Defence pointed out that the Victim had testified in court that around 2.5 inches of the Accused’s penis had penetrated her mouth.

</div> I was not persuaded. For the avoidance of doubt, the ruler used by the Victim was a standard-issue commonly used in the High Court and the ruler’s reference to “tenths” was, in fact, a reference to one-tenth of an inch. In that context, it was not at all surprising that one may confuse the units of “tenths” and “inches” as represented on that ruler. Further, if one closely examined the trial transcript, it would be clear that the response of “inches” did not come entirely from the Victim.

No case of implausibility or difficulty would thus arise in respect of the acts complained of in the charges. Indeed, even on the Accused’s own account of his deformed penis, Dr Bhutia’s and Dr Lee’s consistent evidence was that it remained possible for the lower distal portion of the Accused’s penis to penetrate the Victim’s anus, and that such penetration would be made even easier if a lubricant such as olive oil had been used.

In particular, Dr Pathy’s report included fairly detailed references to the Victim’s emotional state during and immediately after the period of the offences.

Further elaboration on the Victim’s emotional state was simply not called for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As for the Victim’s emotional state <span class="font-italic">as at the time of the </span><span class="font-italic">interviews by the assessors</span>, I did not consider the fact that she had not cried or appeared outwardly distressed during these assessments relevant to her credibility. Indeed, her composure could equally have stood testament to her tenacity, rather than as evidence that she had been lying. There is no default archetype of how a genuine victim of sexual abuse should react when recounting the abuse, however traumatic it may have been. As Dr Pathy explained in court, there may be several reasons why the Victim could remain calm during the assessments, including that a rapport had been built between the Victim and the assessor, or that it was the Victim’s defence mechanism to detach her emotions from the content of a painful memory in her recount of that memory.

</div> All of the above indicated that the Mother was trying to determine the best course of action in a difficult situation. Accordingly, I could not conclude that there was any delay by the Mother in reporting the abuse that would cast doubt on her evidence or that of the Victim.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I add an observation in this regard. In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan </span>[2017] SGHC 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Ariffan</span>”), the High Court acquitted the accused of charges in rape and sexual penetration on the basis that the complainant’s evidence was neither unusually convincing nor sufficiently corroborated. In particular, the High Court suggested that a delay in reporting the abuse may in some circumstances have adverse implications on the Prosecution’s case (at [39]-[42]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 Strictly speaking, the girl’s evidence did not stand alone. There was the evidence of her mother, brother, sister and boyfriend, who she told about the accused’s actions. The corroborative effect of such evidence is stated in s 159 of the Evidence Act… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 However this provision must be applied with caution as Yong CJ had pointed out <span class="font-italic">in Khoo Kwan Hain v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 … although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>corroboration by <span class="font-italic">independent</span> evidence. It would be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The focus on a complaint made “at or about the time when the fact took place”, or a “recent complaint” is apposite. Good sense dictates that a complaint should be made within a reasonable time after the event. Where a person remains silent, and only complains after a long delay, that delay must be scrutinised. In the present case, the girl was not at all prompt in her complaints although she had every opportunity to complain. There were no reasons for her not to confide in members for [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] her family or her boyfriend. She had ample time to recover from any distress or embarrassment that she may had experienced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 Someone so abused and humiliated would be expected to seek help and redress when she breaks her silence. In her case, however, she was still reluctant to make a police report. Furthermore, when she did speak, what she said was contradictory and inconsistent, with allegation of touching (and no rape) to the mother, and rape (and no digital penetration) to the brother, sister and boyfriend. With the passage of time, the girl should not have difficulty to recount accurately the forms of abuse she was put through.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 However, the context in which the Court analysed the implications of a delay in reporting must be considered: it was dealing with the law on corroboration. In that regard, the current position is that subsequent statements by the victim must have been made at the <span class="font-italic">first reasonable opportunity</span> after the commission of the offence in order to constitute corroboration (see <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [173]). This is a liberal approach adopted in Singapore as regards the use of the victim’s own statements as corroboration. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Ariffan</span>, the victim’s delay in her disclosure of the sexual assault was considered relevant in determining whether the requirements of corroboration had been satisfied. I did not read that case to import a general requirement or evidential duty of explanation for every instance of delay of disclosure or reporting even as regards the assessment of credibility and whether the victim’s evidence was unusually convincing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Indeed, as a general proposition, in respect of sexual offences, a mere delay in disclosure or reporting of the assault should not ordinarily be held against the victim, or in this case the parent of the victim, as evidence of a lack of credibility in the victim’s account. In the nature of things, a multitude of reasons may influence one’s decision as to whether and when to make such a report. It may make for a more compelling case theory if reasons were given for the delay, but the court should be slow to adjudge these reasons according to its own notion of how a reasonable victim should have reacted: reasonableness in this particular instance is inevitably personalised and contextual. Exceptionally, delay in reporting may be material if it causes prejudice to the accused’s defence, but that would be a distinct issue which did not arise on our facts.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Possibility of fabrication</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The Defence submitted that the Victim and Mother had fabricated the allegations (i) in order to help the Mother secure a divorce from the Accused, and/or (ii) because the Accused had harshly scolded the Victim and the Mother earlier for separate matters. To this end, he testified that the Mother had repeatedly requested for a divorce between 2009 and 2014, when marital problems arose between the Mother and him due to financial, sexual, and work-related disputes;

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Apart from the Victim’s testimony, I also considered the WhatsApp conversation between her and the Mother, and the medical report by Dr Pathy, to be corroboration of the Victim’s account of the series of sexual abuse within the liberal sense of that term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Two points are notable in this regard. First, the requirement of contemporaneity was satisfied in the present case. The WhatsApp messages were dated one day after the last incident in the series of abuse, and Dr Pathy’s interview with the Victim was done within two months thereafter. These thus fell within the scope of the phrase “at or about the time when the fact took place” in s 159 of the EA, and could be distinguished from the delays of several months in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng</span> <span class="font-italic">v Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 569 (at [80]) and between three and five years in <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> (at [194]) which led to the complaints in those cases being disqualified as corroborative evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Second, I observed that the WhatsApp conversation and Dr Pathy’s medical report covered some, but not all, of the facts constituting the charges. This was perhaps inevitable due to the nature of the allegations and the extensive amount of particulars to which they relate. On the Court of Appeal’s guidance that “[w]hat is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate” (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]; <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [173]), I did not consider the lack of entire coincidence <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>preclusive of the corroborative effect of the conversation and report. In fact, the call to focus on substance and relevance applies <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>in the present case, since the crux of the Defence’s case was an outright denial of <span class="font-italic">the occurrence of</span><span class="font-italic"> all the acts of abuse</span>. Therefore, even if the conversation and report corroborated only parts of the Victim’s testimony as to the occurrence of the abusive acts, they would be confirmative of the Prosecution’s case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Prosecution submitted that the operative sentencing principles in the present case were general and specific deterrence, as well as retributive justice. Further, the Court was urged to calibrate the appropriate sentence taking into consideration the following aggravating factors: (i) the Accused’s abuse of his position of trust, (ii) the high degree of planning and premeditation involved, (iii) the Victim’s young age, (iv) the degrading acts performed on the Victim in a campaign of abuse, and (v) the harm to the Victim. In this regard, the Prosecution also adduced an impact statement from the Victim under s 228(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC for its sentencing submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The submissions on sentence were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The four offences under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC for sexual assault by penetration of a minor under the age of 14: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Prosecution urged the Court to impose a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

On that premise, the present case fell within Category 2 of the <span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span> framework, which deals with offences concerning the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim and attracted a benchmark sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The offence under s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CYPA”) for sexual exploitation of a child or young person: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Prosecution cited the case of <span class="font-italic">AQW v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] 4 SLR 150 (“<span class="font-italic">AQW v PP</span>”) for the benchmark sentence of 6 to 8 months, but urged the Court to give a significant uplift in the present case and impose a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment in light of several aggravating factors. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The five offences under s 354(2) of the PC for outrage of modesty against a minor under the age of 14: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Prosecution submitted variously for sentences between 2 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes, and 4 years’ imprisonment with 9 strokes.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As for the global sentence, the Prosecution sought a total term of 24 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. This involved running two of the s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) sentences (each being a lowered sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in recognition of the totality principle) and the sentence for the tenth charge under s 354(2) of the PC (being 4 years’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane) consecutively. The Prosecution submitted that this was in line with the sentences meted out in other cases concerning sexual abuse by a family member over an extended period (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v BNN </span>[2014] SGHC 7 (“<span class="font-italic">PP v BNN</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">BMD v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] SGCA 70).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defence’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Defence submitted that that the appropriate global sentence would be 18 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. In relation to the s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) offences, in recognition of the enhanced framework adopted by Parliament in relation to minors, he urged the Court to impose 8 years’ imprisonment for each of the charges. As for the five offences under s 354(2) of the PC and the one offence under the s 7 of the CYPA, the Defence broadly agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of around 2 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate. The Defence also agreed with the Prosecution in relation to the sentences that should be run consecutively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 However, the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution in several other aspects. First, it disagreed that the tenth charge – which concerned the last incident in the series of abuse – should attract a higher sentence merely because it was the incident that led to the disclosure of the offences. Secondly, it argued that the Accused’s claiming trial (which necessitated the Victim being called as a witness) should not be an aggravating factor because no trial over allegations of sexual abuse could be pleasant and it remains a critical aspect of justice to allow an accused person to have his day in court. Thirdly, it disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused had deliberately deformed his penis to evade justice, and that the sentence should reflect the Accused’s malice and cunningness. Fourth, the Defence urged the Court to consider as neutral the factor of victim impact, as the Victim appeared to be living a normal life and continued to excel in school. Further, any alleged impact on her was not borne out by the medical reports. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In addition, the Defence submitted that the Court should consider as mitigating the fact that the Accused was untraced, and that he was cooperative throughout the investigations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sentencing principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In the present case, the primary sentencing considerations were retribution for the heinous conduct of the Accused, as well as the general deterrence of similar acts. As noted by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">V Murugesan </span>[2005] SGHC 160: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55        Perpetrators are punished not just for the physical harm they inflict but also for the life-long trauma, debilitating emotional distress and anguish they callously and cruelly inflict and sentence their victims to suffer in silence. In the circumstances, draconian sentences which primarily encapsulate the principles of both retribution and deterrence are ineluctably required and will be invariably meted out to all such offenders. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 This applies not only to rape cases but also to other analogous situations involving serious sexual assault. In the context of inter-familial sexual abuse, general deterrence is of particular concern because of the difficulty in the detection of the offences and the considerable barriers faced by the victims in reporting them (see <span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span> at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Aggravating and mitigating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In <span class="font-italic">AQW v PP</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ sitting in the High Court established two key considerations in the sentencing of accused persons convicted of sexual offences against minors: “the twin notions of (a) the vulnerability of the minor and (b) the degree to which the accused has exploited the minor constitute the key considerations in sentencing for these offences” (at [13]). That case dealt with s 376A(1) of the PC and s 7 of the CYPA, but the principles are of general application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In the present case, turning first to the vulnerability of the Victim, there had clearly been an abuse of the position of trust and authority by the Accused of the highest order, because of his position as the Victim’s father and because of the familial culture which gave him significant power and moral authority in the family. As observed in <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">NF</span>, “abusing a relationship or a position of authority in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal consequence” (at [42]). With regard to several charges, in particular the third and fourth charges in relation to penile-oral penetration, some degree of force had also been used by the Accused against the Victim in abuse of their disparity in strength. Further, the Accused leveraged on the Victim’s hesitation and confusion over the situation to step up with increasingly intrusive sexual acts. The acts of abuse were also committed in the family home, the very place which should otherwise have been a safe sanctuary for the Victim, and from where the Victim had no other place to seek refuge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Here, the Victim’s young age was also an aggravating factor (see <span class="font-italic">AQW </span><span class="font-italic">v PP </span>at [16]). The Defence argued that because the charges themselves dealt with offences against minors and hence carried an enhanced punishment, the youth of the victim should not be factored in as an aggravating factor. I did not agree. The enhanced offences framework took a general position that offences against minors should be dealt with more seriously than those against non-minors, but there was nothing to suggest that this framework was intended to treat equally <span class="font-italic">all</span><span class="font-italic"> offences</span> committed against minors. Further, the framework, by creating a broadly-tiered sentencing regime, did not suggest that the sentencing court would hence be precluded from making a specific finding into the extent of the victim’s vulnerability. There would be no double counting to the prejudice of the accused person, since the aggravating factor of young age would, in relation to such enhanced offences, only apply if the victim concerned was materially younger than the stipulated age-ceiling, and even then, in a graduated manner depending on how much younger the victim was. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In relation to the harm caused to the Victim, the victim impact statement clearly showed the emotional turmoil and trauma caused by the offences. In her statement, the Victim referenced the paranoia, flashbacks, nightmares, and pent up anger that she had gone through. She also described her constant battle with fear of the Accused and of being disbelieved. This was corroborated by Dr Pathy’s report, in which the Victim similarly explained the flashbacks and nightmares that she suffered as a result of the abuse. The Defence argued that the Victim had been able to recover as shown by her good performance in school, but that cannot take away the trauma and lasting damage that would be caused by acts of this nature, particularly given the betrayal by someone in authority. The Victim may very well go on to excel in other aspects of her life in spite of what had happened, as she admirably committed herself to at the end of her impact statement, but that would not be evidence that she suffered no harm; indeed, it may stand as a testament to her tenacity and resilience.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As for the Accused’s culpability and his degree of exploitation, those were also highly significant factors to be taken into account. The Accused here had committed an entire array of penetrative acts established to be the most egregious forms of sexual contact: “Singapore… legislation… differentiate[s] between various forms of sexual contact, the most egregious being penile penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth, and non-penile penetration of the vagina or anus” (see <span class="font-italic">AQW v PP </span>at [19]). The degree of planning and premeditation, as well as the extended duration of time over which the offences were committed, must also be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 That being said, contrary to the Prosecution’s submissions, I agreed with the Defence that even in relation to sexual offences, an accused person’s claiming trial does not in itself expose him to any additional uplift or increase in sentence, but rather connotes merely that he does not qualify for a discount for pleading guilty. There may be situations where the conduct of the defence goes beyond the pale, but that was not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In the circumstances, I did not find any significant mitigating factor operating in favour of the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Taking the above into consideration, the Victim had clearly suffered great harm at the hands of her father over several years, with all the offences occurring in the family home. The punishment imposed must be commensurate with the damage caused and the threat such acts pose in society. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Section 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In relation to the first charge under s 7 of the CYPA, the sentencing benchmark was set out by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">AQW v PP</span> (at [50]) as 6 to 8 months assuming four conditions: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, a sentence of between six and eight months’ imprisonment would be appropriate where (a) the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor involved touching of naked genitalia, regardless of whose genitalia it was, (b) the minor is 14 years old or above, and does not appear to be particularly vulnerable, (c) the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act, and (d) there was no element of abuse of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Apart from the first condition, none of the other conditions apply in the present case; rather, this case was significantly more aggravated. Particular regard should be had to the fact that the Victim was only 11 years old at the time of the offence, that there was an absence of consent by the Victim, and that the Accused had abused his position of authority of the highest order. In the circumstances, a 2-year imprisonment term was warranted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Section 354(2) of the Penal Code </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In relation to the five s 354(2) offences, I observed that the sentencing benchmark in relation to outrage of modesty simpliciter under s 354(1) of the PC, where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs had been intruded upon, is 9 months’ imprisonment with caning (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze </span>[2011] 1 SLR 481 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze</span>”) at [9]). A significant uplift was necessary in this case to take into account the fact that the Victim was young and that the charge was brought under s 354(2) of the PC for aggravated outrage of modesty against a minor below the age of 14. In this regard, the enhanced offence of s 354(2) was introduced by way of amendments to the PC in 2008, and was statutorily prescribed with a sentencing ceiling of around 2.5 times the imprisonment term provided under s 354(1) of the PC for outrage of modesty simpliciter. Precedents from the State Courts cited by the Prosecution were not on all fours with the present facts, but indicated that the offences under s 354(2) of the PC attracted sentences in the range of around 2 to 3 years’ imprisonment with 4 to 9 strokes of the cane.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Accordingly, the difference between this sentencing range and the <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>benchmark was congruous with the difference between the statutory ceilings for sentences under ss 354(2) and 354(1) of the PC. In the circumstances, I considered a 2-year imprisonment term with caning the appropriate starting point for offences under s 354(2) of the PC for aggravated outrage of modesty against a minor below the age of 14, where the victim’s private parts or sexual organs had been intruded upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Specifically, the following s 354(2) offences warranted a sentence of more than 2 years’ imprisonment: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The second charge was framed around the Accused rubbing his penis against the Victim’s face, while she was on the floor. The Accused asked the Victim to sit on the master bedroom floor, then lifted his sarong and pulled it over her head before rubbing his penis on her face. There was some degree of coercion involved in this charge, and the Victim testified that the Accused’s conduct caused her fear. In the circumstances, a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The ninth charge was framed around the Accused’s touching and rubbing the area outside, and attempting to digitally penetrate, the Victim’s vagina. The attempt to effect digital penetration was an intrusive act and caused clear pain and discomfort to the Victim. It thus distinguished the present case from <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v BNN</span>, in which a 37-year-old accused was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for outraging the modesty of his then 13-year-old stepdaughter by groping her breasts and nipples and touching her vulva. A sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The tenth charge was framed around the Accused’s rubbing his penis against both the Victim’s vagina and her anus. In this regard, the Accused had forcefully pulled the Victim down onto the bed and made her lie face up even though she had refused to do so. Further, despite the Victim’s turning her body away to stop and prevent the discomforting contact between the Accused and herself, the Accused persisted in his conduct with some degree of force. However, I did not accept the Prosecution’s submission that this charge warranted a higher sentence merely because it constituted the “straw that broke the camel’s back”. Insofar as it referred to the tenth charge being the last incident in a series of abuse, the mere fact that an offence was the last in time in a series of incidents would not in itself justify a heavier punishment. If the Prosecution meant that the tenth charge was of such severity as to have persuaded the Victim to disclose the whole chain of abusive conduct, this has been given direct effect to by my analysis above. In the circumstances, a sentence of 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Section 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As for the four offences under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC, I agreed with the Prosecution that the benchmarks with respect to Category 2 of the sentencing framework established in <span class="font-italic">PP v NF </span>for rape offences ought to apply. Indeed, the analogy between aggravated sexual assault by penetration and aggravated rape had been drawn by both Parliament and the Courts. In the explanatory statement to clause 68 of the <span class="font-italic">Penal Code </span><span class="font-italic">(Amendment) Bill </span>(Bill 38 of 2007), which introduced the current s 376 of the PC, it was stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The new section 376 provides for a new offence of sexual assault by penetration… The section also provides for an enhanced penalty for aggravated forms of sexual assault by penetration which is analogous to aggravated forms of rape. The enhanced penalty is a mandatory term of imprisonment of not less than 8 years and not more than 20 years, and mandatory caning of not less than 12 strokes. The enhanced penalty is the same as the enhanced penalty for aggravated rape.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Similarly, Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) had in <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">AUB </span>held that “[v]ictims of sexual penetration experience the same emotional scars as rape victims. The sentencing considerations that apply to rape should therefore be applied to victims of sexual penetration as well” (at [7]). Accordingly, a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane was the starting point, and also the appropriate sentence in the present case, taking into considering the general aggravating factors identified above (at [131]-[134]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 After my decisions on conviction and sentence were given, the Court of Appeal handed down its decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGCA 37 recalibrating the sentencing framework for rape offences. That would, however, not have changed the outcome in the present case. In my view, under the first step of the new framework, the present case would have fallen in line with the Band 2 offences – attracting 13 to 17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane – given the presence of several offence-specific aggravating factors such as the Accused’s abuse of position and breach of trust, the presence of some degree of violence, and the young age of the Victim (at [44]). I note that several other cases involving protracted sexual abuse in the familial context, such as <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOM </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1057 and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AHB </span>[2010] SGHC 138, were also listed as illustrations in this Band (at [54]). Thereafter, the second step of the framework requires the Court to calibrate the sentence having regard to offender-specific factors (at [62]). In that regard, the Accused’s persistence in the assault over a protracted period and despite the Victim’s protestations, and his willingness to abuse their disparity in strength and influence, were all factors weighing against the Accused. In the circumstances, even under the new sentencing framework, 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane would have been broadly appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Taking into consideration all the above, the sentences imposed were as follows: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Charge </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offence</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remarks</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 7(a) CYPA</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2 years</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 354(2) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3 years; 6 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 376(4)(b) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">10 years; 12 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">4</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 376(4)(b) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">10 years; 12 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Consecutive</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">5 </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 376(4)(b) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">10 years; 12 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">6</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 376(4)(b) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">10 years; 12 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Consecutive</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">7</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 354(2) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2 years; 6 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">8</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 354(2) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2 years; 6 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">9</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 354(2) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3 years; 6 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">10</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">S 354(2) PC</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3 years 6 months; 6 strokes</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Consecutive</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total sentence</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">23 years and 6 months; 24 strokes </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 It must be clarified that in relation to each of the offences under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane would ordinarily have been warranted. The sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was imposed only in light of the totality principle, which requires the Court at the final stage of sentencing to consider “what would be a proportionate and adequate aggregate sentence having regard to the totality of the criminal behaviour of the accused person” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Finally, although the total number of strokes came to more than the maximum that could be imposed, in view of the substantial imprisonment term, I declined to impose any additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning under s 328(2) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Marital communications privilege </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In the course of cross-examination of the Mother, an issue arose as regards s 124 of the EA and its interaction with s 134(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the EA. The former provision deals with marital communications privilege and provides that no spouse shall be compelled or permitted to disclose any communications made by the other spouse to him during marriage unless that other spouse consents, or in specific situations such as suits between spouses or proceedings where one spouse is prosecuted for a crime against the other spouse. The latter provision precludes the spouse of an accused person from refusing to give evidence in criminal proceedings on the ground that it would tend to prove the commission by the accused of the offence charged. In closing, the Defence tendered written submissions and cited a case commentary by the learned Professor Ho Hock Lai (see<span class="font-italic"> </span>“Spousal Testimony on Marital Communication as Incriminating Evidence – <span class="font-italic">Lim Lye Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> v PP</span>” [1995] Sing JLS 236), but both parties ultimately agreed that this issue did not arise in the present case. In the circumstances, I agreed that neither s 124 nor s 134(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the EA was engaged on the facts; the proper interaction of these two provisions was thus left to be resolved in the appropriate case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lost in translation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Lastly, as I conveyed to the Prosecution during the trial,

</div> the Court would be slow to allow questioning on the nuances of certain words and phrasing in a document that captured only the product of an interpretation rather than the original language. It would generally not be enough to call the interpreter to the stand, unless comprehensive contemporaneous records of the original language used had been kept by him. In the absence of evidence, the interpreter would not be expected to remember the actual words used in the original language.
