</div> Mr Dawkins was not a trained accountant like Mr Grendus. Indeed, one theme running through Mr Grendus’ case is that Mr Dawkins should have been able to read financial statements like Mr Grendus could, to the extent of appreciating the significance of cashflow projections and headcount figures, and being able to quote figures from financial statements without referring to them. That is unfounded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At trial, Mr Dawkins was cross-examined on a mistaken premise: that he had received the Pitch Document (when he had not) by the time of the 24 May 2016 Meeting and so he provided Mr Grendus with information from it (see [59] above). Mr Dawkins did not realise that this was erroneous until after he was off the stand, when he checked the documents he had actually received and found that they did <span class="font-underline">not</span> include the Pitch Document – instead he had an earlier version of the <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> financial statements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the May <span class="font-italic">Pro Forma</span>), with materially different figures.

The work opportunity with DataCore (which Mr Dawkins spoke to Mr Grendus about), and the potential investment in DataCore (which Mr Lynch spoke to Mr Grendus about), were both premised on DataCore being a going concern. In undertaking recruitment work for DataCore in the first place, Mr Dawkins too assumed DataCore to be a going concern that could subsequently pay fees to Aryan Search.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the circumstances, notwithstanding that this representation was not expressly made at the 24 May 2016 Meeting, I accept that Mr Grendus was given the impression that DataCore was a going concern.

</div> I do not agree with this characterisation. I will deal with the differences between the figures for financing, headcount, and also revenue, when I discuss the representations they pertain to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The simple point is: Mr Dawkins had not received the Pitch Document, and so he could not have quoted figures from it, or affirmed that the figures in the Pitch Document were accurate.

</div>
</div> I reject this. I also accept Mr Dawkins’ evidence that he had not quoted figures to Mr Grendus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Indeed, it is not Mr Grendus’ pleaded case that Mr Dawkins had quoted revenue or headcount figures. Mr Grendus says it was Mr Lynch who said DataCore had a pre-Financing head count of nine, and that Mr Dawkins affirmed that by not contradicting Mr Lynch (Representation (g), as particularised: see [77(c)] above). Mr Grendus also says that Mr Lynch said US$965,000 total sales were expected by end-of-year 2016, but critically, he <span class="font-italic">does not</span> say that Mr Dawkins affirmed that (Representation (h), as particularised: see [77(a)] above). Had Mr Dawkins quoted revenue or headcount figures from the Pitch Document at the 24 May 2016 Meeting, Mr Grendus would not have limited Mr Dawkins’ role in relation to Representations (g) and (h) in the way he did in his pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Furthermore, Mr Grendus’ pleaded case is that Representation (a) was made by Mr Lynch, and affirmed by Mr Dawkins not contradicting him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Lynch said the figures in the Pitch Document are accurate, and Mr Dawkins did not say otherwise (see [77(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 By now saying that Mr Dawkins (rather than Mr Lynch) was quoting figures from the Pitch Document, Mr Grendus is departing from his pleaded case (except in relation to representations relating to DataCore’s Financing, in the context of the Shanda Financing, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Representations (d) and (e)). As Denning LJ (as he then was) said in <span class="font-italic">Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley</span> [1956] 1 QB 702: “The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved” (at 712). It would not be right to allow Mr Grendus to now allege that Mr Dawkins quoted figures from the Pitch Document, when that is not his pleaded case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Mr Grendus’ case thus reduces to this: Mr Lynch orally said things about DataCore at the 24 May 2016 Meeting which seemed to match what Mr Grendus <span class="font-italic">later</span> saw in the Pitch Document, and Mr Dawkins did not contradict Mr Lynch <span class="font-italic">at the time</span> of the 24 May 2016 Meeting. However, Mr Grendus can only sue Mr Dawkins for not contradicting Mr Lynch, in circumstances where one would expect Mr Dawkins to contradict Mr Lynch. That is not the case here. Mr Lynch was an insider to DataCore, Mr Dawkins was not. Mr Dawkins had no reason to believe that what Mr Lynch was saying about DataCore was untrue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 If there is no duty to speak (and there was none in the present case), silence is not actionable as a misrepresentation: <span class="font-italic">Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another</span> [2019] SGHC 284 (“<span class="font-italic">Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaopu</span>”) at [59]–[60]; <span class="font-italic">EA Apartments Pte Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Bek and others</span> [2017] 3 SLR 559 (“<span class="font-italic">EA Apartments</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]–[30].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 At trial, Mr Grendus’ counsel told Mr Dawkins that the Pitch Document had been sent to him on 17 May 2016.

It was a possibility. Mr Dawkins expressed confidence that the Shanda Financing would come through, in response to Mr Lynch’s update on the situation, but Mr Dawkins also recognised the possibility that the Shanda Financing might not come through, and so he indicated that he could introduce two other venture capitalists in that event. Mr Lynch acknowledged that it might take another one to two more months for Shanda to reach a decision on financing. Mr Dawkins’ evidence at trial on his understanding of how Series A financing for start-ups generally worked was also consistent with that.

</div> However, DataCore did not owe Aryan Search $120,000 (or any sum). The first $60,000 represented recruitment fees that Aryan Search might have earned for the placement of Paul Szego (“Mr Szego”) with DataCore, but DataCore never hired Mr Szego. As such, strictly speaking, no recruitment fees were payable by DataCore. Mr Dawkins mentioned that he might claim $60,000 nevertheless, but that was not pursued.

There is nothing unusual about DataCore, a start-up, not taking on additional hires unless it had the means to support those hires. In Mr Lynch’s further email to Mr Dawkins (also part of the April 2016 Email Exchange), he said “[it’s] not that we are tight but to be honest with you it may take Shanda 1-2 more months and then we get tight and it does restrict me [bringing] on [Mr Szego]”. Mr Lynch was only talking about whether the additional hire of Mr Szego might be restricted by finances in one to two months’ time, because of the time it was taking to close financing from Shanda. There was no indication that DataCore would be insolvent, or would cease to be a going concern, by 24 May 2016 or 24 June 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Fourth, Mr Grendus relies on Mr Dawkins’ acknowledgement that on 23 May 2016 he had offered for Aryan Search to payroll Mr Szego upfront on behalf of DataCore.

Purported evidence that Mr Dawkins was in the habit of cheating others on other occasions, is irrelevant to whether Mr Dawkins cheated Mr Grendus in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 Section 15 of the EA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.  When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional or done with a particular knowledge or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 Illustration (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to s 15 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">A</span> is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is insured. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The facts that <span class="font-italic">A</span> lived in several houses successively, each of which he insured, in each of which a fire occurred, and after each of which fires <span class="font-italic">A</span> received payment from a different insurance office, are relevant as tending to show that the fire was not accidental. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 For similar fact evidence to be admissible under s 15 of the EA, it must constitute a “series” of similar occurrences that are unlikely to have been produced by accident or inadvertence (see <span class="font-italic">Mas Swan </span>at [110]; <span class="font-italic">Pinsler</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 3.017). A “series” of similar occurrences connotes a recurring pattern which would ordinarily require proof of more than one other similar act (<span class="font-italic">Hin Hup </span>([228] above) at [37]). A significant similarity as to <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> may amount to striking resemblances or unusual features such that the court should find there was a series of similar occurrences involving the person in question (<span class="font-italic">Hin Hup</span> at [36]). In <span class="font-italic">Hin Hup</span>, the driver had been involved in seven other similar road accidents within a period of ten months prior to the accident that was the subject of the suit; the driver would also ask about insurance coverage whenever he applied for a job. The court found that the eight similar road accidents constituted a systemic course of conduct (at [29]) and so evidence relating to the seven previous accidents were admissible as similar fact evidence (at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 The present case is quite different.

Nothing is said about offences committed <span class="font-italic">after</span> the one for which the accused is charged. In so far as Mr Grendus seeks to rely on Mr Lee-Simion’s evidence to show that Mr Dawkins, by virtue of having made the alleged representations to Mr Lee-Simion on a subsequent occasion, must also have made similar representations to him at the 24 May 2016 Meeting, such evidence relates to what Mr Dawkins supposedly had done and not his intentions at the time of the 24 May 2016 Meeting.

Therefore, if Mr Lee-Simion’s evidence is inadmissible under ss 14 and 15 of the EA, it cannot then become admissible under s 11(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) for it relates to an incident other than that involving Mr Grendus, and so is not specifically connected to the facts in issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What happened between Mr Dawkins and Mr Lee-Simion?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 As between Mr Dawkins and Mr Lee-Simion, I accept Mr Dawkins’ account of their interaction.

</div> Mr Dawkins did not tell Mr Lee-Simion that his money would be held in escrow, or that DataCore’s principals were independently wealthy, or what his money would be used for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Indeed, Mr Lee-Simion’s evidence (which I reject) is that Mr Dawkins had already represented to him at the Boat Quay Bar Meeting with Mr Lynch that DataCore’s principals were independently wealthy, and that his money would be held in escrow (see [253] above). Had this been said pursuant to some conspiracy, one would expect Mr Dale to know, in which case he would not be asking Mr Lynch on 3 July 2016 to get Mr Dawkins to say these things. If Mr Dale did not know that had already been represented, one would expect a reply from Mr Lynch to Mr Dale’s final email on 3 July 2016 to apprise him of this – but there is no evidence of that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 The fact that Mr Dawkins was not a recipient of any of these emails between Mr Lynch and Mr Dale points to Mr Dawkins <span class="font-underline">not</span> being a conspirator. There would have been no need for Mr Lynch to say he would have a word with Mr Dawkins, no need for Mr Dale to tell Mr Lynch to get Mr Dawkins to say certain things – either Mr Lynch or Mr Dale could simply have copied Mr Dawkins in those emails. After all, they both had Mr Dawkins’ email address – they had sent him emails previously (see, <span class="font-italic">eg </span>[29] and [43] above). Mr Dawkins was not put in the loop, because he was <span class="font-underline">not</span> part of what was discussed and agreed between Mr Lynch and Mr Dale. Instead, the only recipients Mr Dale added were Mr Douady, and for one of Mr Dale’s two emails, the Law Firm as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Mr Dale’s 3 July 2016 email at 9.22pm about him and Mr Douady personally needing the money, says nothing about DataCore’s financial situation. Moreover, this was on 3 July 2016, after Mr Grendus had already invested on 24 June 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 Mr Grendus’ real grievance is not so much that DataCore was already in a poor financial state (if that were even the case), but rather that Mr Dale improperly took away investment monies received by DataCore. Thus, Mr Grendus says Mr Dale withdrew the funds injected by investors like him shortly after receipt without proper account; and that he believes that Mr Dale effectively ran DataCore and CorePlus as his personal bank account and misappropriated investor monies by deception for his personal pecuniary gain.

</div> Curiously, Mr Grendus does not plead that Mr Lynch withdrew investor funds, although Mr Lynch was a representative of DataCore and Mr Dawkins was not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 There was no basis for Mr Grendus to make that accusation against Mr Dawkins. When asked in cross-examination how Mr Dawkins could possibly have withdrawn investor funds from DataCore, Mr Grendus sought to explain his accusation against Mr Dawkins as “verbiage”, in this convoluted answer:
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-7a279410-7391-41d3-9124-5ad93662f8ff" data-toggle="modal" type="button">249</button></sup>

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The verbiage is they would be withdrawn as it was indicated that they would either be paid out to [Mr Dawkins] and the term ‘and/or’ was used here. So in this particular case, the withdrawing of funds happened via [Mr Dale] who then paid [Mr Lynch] and potentially could have paid [Mr Dawkins] and did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 That answer is somewhat incomprehensible. If Mr Dale withdrew money and could have paid Mr Dawkins but did not, that is no basis to say there was a conspiracy that Mr Dale and/or Mr Dawkins would withdraw investor funds. Mr Dawkins was just a recruiter for DataCore – he had no means to withdraw any funds from DataCore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 Mr Dawkins was not part of any conspiracy to defraud. As Mr Dawkins’ email to Mr Lynch from the April 2016 Email Exchange shows, Mr Dawkins himself was interested to invest in DataCore (see [37] above). He did not know that DataCore and CorePlus were just a scheme to defraud investors (if that were the case). If Mr Grendus is right about that scheme, had Mr Dawkins invested, he would have found himself in the same boat as Mr Grendus. The fact that Mr Dawkins proceeded to lend S$10,000 to Mr Lynch in June 2017 (see [191] above) (which was never repaid, with Mr Lynch then going bankrupt) is a further indication that, even until then (more than a year after the 24 May 2016 Meeting), Mr Dawkins did not think that Mr Lynch was a fraudster cheating people of their money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 Mr Grendus’ claim in conspiracy fails, and with it, all of Mr Grendus’ claims against Mr Dawkins.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Vicarious liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 As I find Mr Dawkins not liable to Mr Grendus in any way, it follows that there is no vicarious liability on the part of Aryan Search.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 In any event, I accept Aryan Search’s contention that even if Mr Dawkins were liable in some way, Aryan Search should not be held vicariously liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng and another v Munib Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Madni and another</span> [2017] 2 SLR 1074, the Court of Appeal indicated that even if there were an employment or equivalent relationship, a second stage consideration is whether there is a sufficient connection between the relationship on the one hand, and the commission of the tort on the other – that relationship must have created or significantly enhanced, the very risk of the tort being committed (see [44] and [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 In the present case, there was an employment relationship between Aryan Search and Mr Dawkins. But Mr Dawkins was employed as a recruiter, he was not employed to solicit investments. Mr Dawkins says that as part of his job, or incidental to it, he would make introductions that could lead to investments – as he did with Shanda, Mr Grendus, and Mr Lee-Simion; he saw that as part of networking, providing value to clients and potential clients. In that regard, he told Mr Grendus that DataCore was looking for investors, and he also mentioned that he had introduced Shanda for DataCore’s Financing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 But those introductions are not what Mr Grendus is suing about. Mr Grendus’ case is centred on a discussion with Mr Dawkins at a cigar bar, when they were no longer talking about job opportunities, but only investment. He does not say he was continuing to interact with Mr Dawkins <span class="font-italic">because he was a recruiter</span>. Indeed, Mr Grendus’ evidence is that he only agreed to meet Mr Dawkins because he heard that DataCore was looking for investors.

It would not be fair, just, and reasonable to impose liability on Aryan Search for the conduct complained of.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relief claimed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 In his SOC, Mr Grendus claimed a declaration that the DataCore Subscription and the CorePlus Debenture have been validly rescinded; alternatively, rescission of the DataCore Subscription and the CorePlus Debenture. These are properly matters as between Mr Grendus, on the one hand, and DataCore and CorePlus on the other hand. Neither DataCore nor CorePlus were parties to these proceedings, and in the circumstances, I make no orders on those prayers for relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 Mr Grendus then claimed, jointly and severally against each of the four defendants:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the sum of US$200,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) damages;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) interest at the rate of 12% per annum or such other rate as ordered by the Court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) costs; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) further or other relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 I dismiss all of Mr Grendus’ claims against Mr Dawkins and Aryan Search.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 I would add that Mr Grendus’ claim for interest at the rate of 12% per annum was based on the return he was to receive from the CorePlus Debenture. He did not, however, prove that he would have obtained a return of 12% per annum had he instead put his US$200,000 to some other use. If I had found him entitled to any sum, I would not have awarded him interest at 12% per annum, but only at the usual rate of 5.33% per annum. But I have found that he is not entitled to recover anything from Mr Dawkins or Aryan Search.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 In any event, the effective interest rate under the CorePlus Debenture was not 12% per annum – there was an interest-free period from 24 June 2016 (when Mr Grendus made the Investments) until but not including 8 September 2016, and interest only ran from 8 September 2016 till maturity on 8 June 2017.
