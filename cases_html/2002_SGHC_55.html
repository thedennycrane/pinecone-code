</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<b xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>The facts</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1 In this summons the Applicant ("Sia") applies to set aside

the statutory demand ("SD") of the Respondent, ("Ko") in respect of

the sum of US$2,197,260.27. On 6 February I allowed Sia’s application and set aside

the SD. Ko has since appealed and I now give my grounds of decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The SD is based on a promissory note dated 4 January 2001 made by Sia

and Michael John Shone as attorney-in-fact for Ko. Under the promissory note, Sia

acknowledged that he was indebted to Ko in the sum of US$2 million and undertook to pay a

sum of US$166,666.67 on the first of each month from May 2001 to May 2002 in full and

final settlement of the debt. Clause 3 of the promissory note states that, as collateral

for the debt, Sia has pledged 50 membership certificates of the Blue Canyon Country Club

("BCCC"). In the promissory note Sia authorised Ko, in the event of default of

any instalment payment, to sell the memberships and apply the proceeds to reduce the

outstanding amount of the debt.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 Sia submits the SD is in breach of r 94(5)(b) of the Bankruptcy Rules

and seeks an order of the court to set aside the SD under r 8(2)(c). Rule 94(5) provides

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">If the creditor holds any property of the debtor or any security for

  the debt, there shall be specified in the demand-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the full amount of the debt; and<br/>

    (b) the nature and value of the security or the assets.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I set out below, r 98(2)(c). I set out also r 98(2)(e) which is the

ground upon which I set aside the SD. They provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The court shall set aside the statutory demand if —</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">(c) it appears that the creditor holds assets of the debtor or security

    in respect of the debt claimed by the demand, and either rule 94 (5) has not been complied

    with, or the court is satisfied that the value of the assets or security is equivalent to

    or exceeds the full amount of the debt;</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">(e) the court is satisfied, on other grounds, that the demand ought to

    be set aside.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The content of the SD is not in dispute. Under the "Demand"

section of the SD, the following statement is made:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Creditor claims that you owe at 31 August 2001 the sum of

  US$2,197,260.27 and interest accruing at US$21.91 full particulars of which are set out in

  Part A of this demand, and that it is payable immediately and, to the extent of the sum

  demanded, is secured to the value of the US$NIL. (The Company providing security has been

  placed in Bankruptcy Re-Organisation by its creditors under Thai Law. This renders the

  security of no or negligible value.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">And under the "Particulars of Debt" section, the following

statement is made:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The creditor holds no valuable security on your estate, or part thereof

  for the payment of the abovementioned amount or any part thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 Mr Mulani, counsel for Sia, submits that the SD did not specify the

nature and value of the security and therefore is not in compliance with r 94(5)(b). In

his affidavit in support of this application, Sia stated that pursuant to the promissory

note, he had pledged as security for the debt, the 50 membership certificates in the BCCC

which were assets belonging to him personally. He said that the debt owing to him should

have been offset by the said amount.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 Ms Leong, counsel for Ko, submits that the SD is in compliance with

the said rules as the pledged membership certificates are worthless. A Thai lawyer,

Amornwat Thirakrittaporn, had filed an affidavit on 29 October 2001 in which he stated

that the BCCC was owned by a Thai company, Murex Company Limited ("Murex"),

which is also the co-issuer of the membership certificates. Pursuant to the petition of

Siam City Bank plc, Murex was placed under a "Restructuring Proceeding" by order

of the Central Bankruptcy Court on 26 April 2001. That court has since appointed managers

– called Planners - to take control of the business and assets of Murex and under

Thai law these are protected against any action by any other creditor. He was of the

opinion that any sale of memberships from that date would require the Planners’

consent and <i>"clearly, such consent will not be forthcoming until the Planers and

the court have been able to ascertain whether the project can be restructured as a viable

golf course operation, or, alternatively, must be sold."</i> Consequently, he

concluded:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The Membership Certificates are rendered effectively worthless,

  as they cannot be sold in the manner described in the promissory note or at all and,

  therefore, have no value. As such, they cannot be regarded as security for the debt of the

  Applicant."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 Sia’s response to this was that the membership certificates

belonged to him and not to Murex. An affidavit was filed in his behalf by Nuthavuth

Chatlertpipat, another Thai lawyer, giving the opinion that there was no applicable

provision in the Bankruptcy Act of Thailand which allows or entitles the Planners or

official receiver to manage the assets belonging to a third party. He therefore disagreed

with the opinion of Mr Thirakrittaporn that any proposed sale of the club membership

belonging to Sia would require the approval of the Planners.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 In the SD, it was asserted that:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(i) the security was provided by a company, presumably Murex;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(ii) Murex had been placed in "Bankruptcy Re-Organisation" by

its creditors under Thai law; and</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(iii) this has rendered the security of no or negligible value.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Sia does not dispute assertion (ii). However he disputes (i) and (iii).

Sia’s position is that the security was provided by him and that the re-organisation

of Murex does not affect the value of the security given. In respect of (i), the

promissory note does not mention Murex at all. It states that Sia had pledged the 50

membership certificates. Therefore on the face of the note, which is an agreement with Ko,

Sia is the owner of the 50 membership certificates pledged. Therefore, to the extent that

Ko is asserting in the SD that the basis upon which he is saying that the security is

worthless because the company that provided the security had been placed in Bankruptcy

Re-organisation, this is incorrect.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 In reality, the true value of any asset is the sum that it will fetch

in the open market. If there are persons prepared to pay money for each membership

certificate notwithstanding that Murex is under Bankruptcy re-organisation, then the value

of the 50 membership certificates would be the total sum that can be raised by their sale

in the open market. There has been no evidence in this regard. Although there were

affidavits filed in Ko’s behalf attesting to the impossibility of the sale of those

membership certificates, there were also affidavits filed in Sia’s behalf asserting

the converse. In order to determine the truth of the matter, it would be necessary to

cross-examine the deponents.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 Section 61(1) of the Bankruptcy Act prescribes four conditions to

the presentation of a bankruptcy petition:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(a) the debt is not less than $10,000;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) the debt is for a liquidated sum payable to the petitioning

creditor immediately;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) the debtor is unable to pay the debt; and</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) where the debt is incurred outside Singapore, such debt is payable

by the debtor to the petitioning creditor by virtue of a judgment or award which is

enforceable by execution in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The issue in the present petition pertains to limb (c), i.e. whether

the debtor is unable to pay the debt. Section 62 of the Act provides that a debtor shall

be presumed to be unable to pay any such debt that is immediately payable under three

situations. The present case concerns the first one, viz. where an SD has been served on

the debtor in the prescribed manner, at least 21 days have elapsed since service, and the

debtor has neither complied with the SD nor applied to court to set it aside.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 Section 2 of the Act defines "statutory demand" as:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"a demand in the prescribed which requires the person to whom it

  is addressed to pay, secure or compound to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor

  making the demand, any debt owed by him to the creditor"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The form of the SD is prescribed in rule 94 of the Bankruptcy Rules.

The bone of contention, r 94(5) which is set out above, provides that if the creditor

holds any security for the debt, the SD shall specify the full amount of the debt and the

nature and value of the security. Ko concedes that he holds the 50 membership certificates

as security. But he has valued the security as "nil". I accept that the

realisable value of the security may well be substantially lower than the US$2 million

stated in the promissory note, or it may even be worthless. But Ko has not only misstated

in the SD the basis for his conclusion as to its zero value, he has not provided any

cogent evidence for this valuation in the affidavits filed on his behalf. Ms Leong had

submitted that this did not prejudice Sia because in any event, the debt was clearly

greater than the value of the security. While I accept that the debt would in all

probability be higher than the value of the security and it was only a matter of how much,

I was of the view that the circumstances of the present case justify setting aside the SD

for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 Firstly, r 94(6) of the Bankruptcy Rules provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(6) The debt of which payment is claimed shall be the full amount of

  the debt less the amount specified as the value of the security or assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">And s 62(a) of the Act provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">For the purposes of a creditor’s petition, a debtor shall, until

  he proves to the contrary, be presumed to be unable to pay any debt within the meaning of

  section 61(1)(c) if the debt is immediately payable and –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) (i) the petitioning creditor to whom the debt is owed has served on

    him in the prescribed manner, a statutory demand;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) at least 21 days have elapsed since the statutory demand was

    served; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the debtor has neither complied with it nor applied to the court

    to set it aside; …</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Read together, this means that the SD is complied with if payment is

made within 21 days of the amount of the debt claimed less the amount specified as the

value of the security.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 In the present case, Ko has valued the security as "nil".

This means that in order to comply with the SD, Sia would have to pay the full sum of the

debt claimed. On the one hand, Ko has held, and is holding, on to the security which was

valued at US$2 million in the promissory note. And on the other hand he has valued it as

"nil", without providing reasonable evidence thereof. Further, although pursuant

to the promissory note, he is entitled to sell the memberships in the event of default, he

has not done so. It would appear that Ko: (a) does not wish to sell the memberships to

reduce the amount owed; (b) values them in the SD to be of zero value; (c) has not

produced any cogent evidence for the basis of this valuation; and (d) yet does not wish to

return the membership certificates to Sia so that the latter can sell them to raise money

to repay at least part of the debt. It does not seem fair to me that Ko can have his cake

and eat it in this manner. Rule 98(2)(c) requires the court to set aside the SD if r 94(5)

has not been complied with. Even if it can be argued that there has been compliance, r

98(2)(e) gives the court the discretion to set aside the SD on other grounds. If Ko had in

the SD given a value to the security that Sia had considered reasonable, the latter might

have elected, or been placed in a position, to pay the balance to satisfy the debt. If Ko

had considered the security to be worthless, he ought to have returned them to Sia so that

the latter would be given the opportunity to use them to raise funds to repay the debt or

part of it. For Ko to hold on to them in the present circumstances is, in my view, unfair

and justifies the court exercising its discretion under r 98(2)(e) to set aside the SD.</p>
