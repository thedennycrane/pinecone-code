<p>FACTS</p>
<p align="justify"></p></b>The appellants appealed against a summary judgment given by the

High Court which adjudged that the appellants had infringed the copyright of the

respondents in a certain artistic work when they published a notice containing the work

and granted an injunction to restrain the appellants. 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">The appellants raised the defences of honest practices under section

27(6) of the Trademarks Act (‘s 26(6) TMA’) and fair dealing under section 37 of

the Copyright Act (‘s 37 CRA’).<b></b></p>
<p xmlns="">HELD, ALLOWING THE APPEAL:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">For the first defence, if any party wished to read more into or

attribute a motive to the notice which contained the copyright work, then the alleged

infringer must be permitted to explain and to call his witnesses and be subject to

cross-examination. It is not inconceivable that s 27(6) TMA could apply to the situation.

Moreover, it could not be the intention of Parliament to authorise the doing of an act

which would infringe a related right, so s 27(6) TMA could well apply to copyright

infringement actions. The issues surrounding the applicability of this section are of some

complexity and require more mature consideration (See [16] – [19]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As for the second defence, s 37 CRA specifically provides for the

defence of fair dealing to apply to an "artistic" work. One of the events relied

upon by the appellants to show that there was confusion occurred a month before the

alleged infringement act, so the question of whether the event was a current one was not

clear cut. The questions of whether there was confusion and whether the event reported was

current raised issues of fact and law which should not be determined summarily (See [25]

– [26], [29]).</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1        This

was an appeal against a summary judgment given by the High Court which adjudged that the

appellants, Bee Cheng Hiang Hup Chong Foodstuff Pte Ltd (BCH), had infringed the copyright

of the respondents, Fragrance Foodstuff Pte Ltd (Fragrance), in a certain artistic work

and granted an injunction to restrain BCH. After hearing the parties on the appeal, we set

aside the summary judgment and gave BCH unconditional leave to defend the claim. We now

give our reasons.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2        BCH

and Fragrance are both in the business of manufacturing and selling, among others, a type

of sweet barbecue meat which is known here as "Bakwa". The business of BCH

started earlier in 1930 while Fragrance were only incorporated in April 1990. BCH have

been selling their products under a trade mark which consisted of the Chinese character

"Xiang" written in a calligraphic form (hereinafter referred to as mark

"X"). This mark appears on the left at Annex A.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3        

Fragrance sell their products under a trade mark which also consists of the Chinese

character "Xiang" but represented in a graphical/stylized manner in an oval

frame, with a flicking tongue coming out of a mouth and licking lips and with the English

word "FRAGRANCE" set out below that frame (hereinafter referred to as mark

"Y"). This mark appears on the right side of Annex A.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4        Mark

"Y" was created in late 1994 by one Chionh Cher Tin (Chionh) who was specially

commissioned by Fragrance to produce such a mark (the work). On 5 February 2002, shortly

before the institution of the present action, Chionh formally assigned his copyright in

the work to Fragrance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5        In

July 1995, Fragrance registered the work as a trade mark under class 30 covering biscuits,

cakes, pastry and confectionery. At the same time, they also applied to register the work

as a trade mark under class 29 for dried minced pork, pork floss, chicken floss, snack

foods, etc. However, this application is still pending because of opposition by BCH.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6        The

event which gave rise to the action was an advertisement of a half-page dimension

appearing over two days, on 2 and 3 February 2002, in the local English and Chinese

newspapers which set out the two marks and stated that BCH and Fragrance are not related

companies (the notice). The advertisement is shown at Annex A.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7        When

the advertisements first appeared in the newspapers, the Lunar New Year (LNY) of 2002 was

just ten days away, falling on 12 February 2002. It was common ground that during the

period before the LNY, demand by the public for Bakwa was extremely high, as it was an

essential delicacy for the festivities.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8        

Concurrently with the publication of the advertisements, BCH also distributed to the

public pamphlets containing the same notice. Furthermore, on 3 February 2002 the Lianhe

Zaobao ran a news report on the notice where it was stated that BCH might continue to

publish the notice to dispel confusion. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9        BCH

explained that the move to issue the notice was prompted by the fact that there was

evidence of confusion on the part of the public. BCH referred to two incidents to

substantiate that. First, in 1998, Bloomdale (S) Pte Ltd, a gift and hamper company,

mistakenly advertised in its LNY catalogue the pork and fish floss of Fragrance as those

of BCH. On demand by BCH, Bloomdale had to apologise and make a correction. Secondly, in

the February 2002 issue of <i>Singapore Women’s Weekly</i> where there was a write up

on Fragrance, BCH’s telephone number was given as the telephone number of Fragrance.

The publisher of the magazine apologised for the mistake stating that the intern who had

done the write-up had checked the telephone number of Fragrance using the Chinese

character "Xiang" not realizing that BCH used a similar logo. The intern wrongly

assumed that BCH’s telephone number was that of Fragrance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10        

Following the publication of the notice, correspondence ensued between the parties’

solicitors, with Fragrance seeking an apology and asking for damages for the infringement

of the copyright in the work. BCH’s solicitors replied explaining why the notice was

published and rejected the claim of Fragrance. This led to the institution of the present

action by Fragrance, both for copyright and trade mark infringements.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11        At

the same time the suit was filed, Fragrance applied for an <i>ex parte</i> interim

injunction against BCH in respect of both the alleged copyright and trade mark

infringements. The application was adjourned to be heard <i>inter-partes</i>. In the

meantime, after BCH entered appearance to the action, Fragrance applied for summary

judgment against BCH in respect of the alleged copyright infringement. Both applications

came before the judge-in-chambers who granted summary judgment in favour of Fragrance by

the issue of an injunction restraining BCH from infringing Fragrance’s copyright in

the work, with a caveat that until the trial of the action, Fragrance would not take any

further steps or execution proceedings. In the light of BCH’s undertaking that they

would not further publish the notice until trial, no order for an interim injunction was

made by the court in respect of the alleged trade mark infringement.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Issues</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12        It

was not disputed that BCH did, without the consent of Fragrance, reproduce and publish

Fragrance’s trade mark in the notice which BCH issued. By so publishing the trade

mark of Fragrance, there was <i>prima facie</i> infringement of Fragrance’s copyright

in the work. Before us, BCH raised two main defences, which were also raised in the court

below.</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) Section 27(6) of the

    Trademarks Act;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) Section 37 of the Copyright

    Act</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Section 27(6)</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13        We

shall deal with the two defences in turn. Section 27(6) of the Trade Marks Act provides:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Nothing in subsections (1) to (5)

    shall be construed as preventing the use of a registered trade mark by any person for the

    purpose of identifying goods or services as those of the proprietor or a licensee, but any

    such use otherwise than in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial

    matters shall be treated as infringing the registered trade mark if the use without due

    cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute

    of the trade mark.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14        BCH

argued that the reproduction of mark Y in the notice was for the purpose of identifying

goods or services as those of Fragrance. However, this was not accepted by the judge below

who held that (at 37):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"I accepted

    (Fragrance’s) interpretation of the advertisements/notices as containing a subtle

    suggestion that the defendants’ goods had been confused with those of the

    plaintiffs’ which were inferior to the defendants’, that the plaintiffs were

    responsible for such confusion and, that the plaintiffs copied the defendants’ logo.

    The situation was aggravated by Wong’s subsequent press statements."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15        The

judge went on to remark that what was objectionable about the notice was the fact that BCH

did not disclose therein that in registering their trade mark they had disclaimed the

exclusive use of the Chinese word "Xiang", except in the form in which that word

appeared in their mark. The judge seemed to indicate that she was unable to accept the

argument that s 27(6) applied because the motive of BCH was wrong.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16        On

our part, we would like to make three observations on the defence based on s 27(6).

Firstly, and with respect, we thought the judge read more into the notice than is

warranted. As is clear from the notice which appeared at Annex A, the notice merely stated

that mark ‘X’ belonged to BCH and mark ‘Y’ belonged to Fragrance, and

it also informed the public that the two marks are not the same and that the two companies

are not related. If any party wished to read more into it or to attribute a motive to the

notice, then the alleged infringer must be permitted to explain and to call his witnesses

and be subject to cross-examination. On a disputed question such as this, it should not be

resolved on the basis of affidavit evidence, without the benefit of cross-examination.

This was where we found some difficulties with the approach of the judge.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17        

Second, we did not think it was possible to contend, just from the manner in which mark

‘Y’ was depicted in the notice, that s 27(6) could not conceivably apply to the

situation. On the face of it, it is certainly open to BCH to argue that mark ‘Y’

was reproduced to identify the goods of Fragrance. The two marks were given equal

prominence. The purpose of it all was to inform the public that the two marks are

different and the two companies are not related. We would hasten to add that, at this

juncture, it would not be appropriate for us to say more, as the entire case will be

proceeding to trial and this question has to be determined by the trial judge in the light

of the evidence adduced before him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18        

Thirdly, and assuming s 27(6) is applicable to the situation in hand, BCH contended that

their act of reproducing mark ‘Y’ for the purposes approved under that section

could not conceivably be in infringement of the copyright in the work forming mark

‘Y’. There must be an implied permission, in so far as copyright is concerned.

It could not be the intention of Parliament to authorize the doing of an act which would

infringe a related right. We should also add that BCH had also put the argument in this

alternative way: in electing to use the work as a trade mark, Fragrance must be taken to

have granted an implied licence for other traders to deal with that work in a manner that

is not inconsistent with its status as a trade mark.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19        In

our opinion, the issues surrounding the applicability of s 27(6) are certainly of some

complexity and require more mature consideration. It is true that in <i>RA &amp; A Bailey

&amp; Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</i> 6 IPR 279 (<i>Bailey’s case</i>), a

case which did not involve the consideration of a provision similar to that of s 27(6),

Young J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, said at 290:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Apart from the <i>British

    Leyland</i> case there has not been as far as I know any judicial indication of any policy

    of the law that where a person has more than one industrial property right, it can only

    avail it of the protection afforded to one of those rights and where there is a conflict

    it is copyright which is disregarded."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20        But

it seems to us that these views may have to be confined to the material facts of that

case. There, the plaintiff, a manufacturer of the "Bailey’s Original Irish

Cream", made arrangement with third parties to import and distribute the product in

Australia in bottles with an elaborate pictorial label (Australian label), part of which

was registered as a trade mark. The defendant imported the same product bearing an almost

identical label which was distributed by the plaintiff in the Netherlands. It was admitted

that the Australian label was an artistic work which enjoyed copyright. Young J held that

the importation and sale of the Dutch bottle by the defendants did not infringe the

Australian trade mark but it constituted infringement of the plaintiff’s copyright.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21        As

indicated before, Young J declined to follow the House of Lords’ decision in <i>British

Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd &amp; Ors v Armstrong Patents Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i> (1986) 6

IPR 102, where the House held that it was not a breach of copyright for the defendants to

produce parts to repair vehicles by producing a copy of the relevant exhaust pipe. Some of

the judgments of their Lordships would appear to be based on the principle of

non-derogation from the grant rather than implied licence. In the words of Lord Templemen

(at p. 129):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"BL own the car and the

    copyright in a drawing of an exhaust pipe fitted to the car. BL sell the car and retain

    the copyright. The exercise by BL of their copyright in the drawing will render the car

    unfit for the purpose for which the car is held. BL cannot exercise their copyright so as

    to prevent the car being repaired by replacement of the exhaust pipe.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A purchaser of a patented article

    may carry out repairs to it without being held liable for infringement."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22        Of

course, the situation in <i>British Leyland</i> is quite different from that prevailing in

the present case which concerns the scope of s 27(6). The position in <i>Bailey’s

case</i> is also dissimilar. The general principles might well be as stated by Young J

that "a person who has both a trade mark and copyright is <i>generally</i> entitled

to protection against both." But could it really be the intention of Parliament in

enacting s 27(6) that while Parliament sanctioned the reproduction of a trade mark for the

purposes of identifying the goods or services of the owner of the trade mark, it

nevertheless leaves the defendant open to an action on a related ground of infringement of

copyright? No authority from any other jurisdictions was cited to us which touched on the

application or interpretation of an equivalent provision. Thus, in our opinion, the point

deserves fuller ventilation.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Fair dealing</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23        We

now turn to consider the second defence of fair dealing, which is set out in section 37 of

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24        As

is implicit from the wording of the provision, fair dealing can only apply where there is

an element of public interest. On this, the judge held that, first, the matter was only of

interest to the parties and not to the general public. Second, she felt that the question

of confusion between the two marks could not be qualified as current events, as the two

incidents of confusion occurred some time ago. Third, in reliance on a passage of Lord

Denning MR in <i>Hubbard v Vosper</i> [1972] 2 QB 84 at 94-95, she said that this defence

under s 37 is not available to an artistic work.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25        It

seems to us that the third point made by the judge could hardly be sustained. Section 37

specifically provides for a "fair dealing with a literary … <u>artistic</u>

work". To say that there cannot be "fair dealing" with an artistic work

would be contrary to what is plainly provided for in the section itself. We should mention

that in <i>Hubbard v Vosper </i>(at p.98),<i> </i>Megaw LJ even contemplated a case in

which the quotation of an entire short work might be fair dealing.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26        As

regards the first and second points made by the judge relating to the questions of

confusion and whether it was a current event, we think these are questions which require

more in depth exploration, with evidence to be adduced before the court. Both parties

operate numerous retail outlets throughout Singapore, with BCH having 22 outlets and

Fragrance, 16. If there was, in fact, confusion in the mind of some members of the public,

that could conceivably constitute a "current event". The fact that Lianhe Zaobao

carried a news report on 3 February 2002 on the alleged confusion is some evidence of the

matter being a "current event" and it being a matter of some public interest.

The judge also seemed to think that the events was dated. But one of the event relied upon

by BCH to show that there was confusion occurred in January/February 2002, the February

2002 issue of <i>Singapore Women’s Weekly</i>. So the question, of whether the event

was dated, was not clear-cut. Besides, the Copyright Act does not define what is a

"current event".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27        In <i>Pro

Sieben Media AG v Carlton UK Television Ltd</i> [1998] FSR 43 Laddie J said that the

defence was concerned with "allowing fair use of copyright material for the purpose

of reporting matters of current, as opposed to historical, interest or concern." This

case went on appeal where Walker LJ said (at [1999] FSR 610 at 620) that ‘reporting

current events’ was an expression of wide and indefinite scope. "Any attempt to

plot their precise boundaries is doomed to failure … (it) should be interpreted

liberally."</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28        In <i>BBC

v British Sky</i> <i>Broadcasting Ltd</i> [1991] 21 IPR 503, two points made by Scott J

were pertinent. First, there was no justification for limiting the defence so as to apply

only to reporting current events in a general news programme. Second, the fact that the

alleged infringer was a commercial rival of the copyright owner did not, <i>ipso facto</i>,

take the case outside fair dealing. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29        We

must stress that this court is not, at this stage, offering any definitive views on the

defence under s 37. What was uppermost in our mind was that both the points,

‘confusion’ and ‘current event’, raised issues of fact and law which

should not be determined summarily. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30        The

judge below said that she did not believe that consumers were actually confused by the two

trade marks. She expressed scepticism on the instance of confusion cited by BCH where a

Fragrance’s customer attempted to exchange product at a BCH outlet as she could not

"imagine how customers of perishable products like barbecued pork would be allowed to

exchange what they had purchased unless the packing contained expiry dates and their

purchases had indeed expired at the time they bought the same". It should be

remembered that besides Bakwa, the parties also sold other products. Some of the products

sold could well have been properly sealed. In the particular instance mentioned, it was

vacuum packed sausage. It is possible that a customer may want to change what he has

bought not because of any expiry date but because he has changed his mind as to what he

wants. It seems to us these are matters which should be gone into. It is true that a mere

assertion does not, <i>ipso facto</i>, give a party a right to defend an action. Much

would depend on the nature of the assertion and the circumstances relating thereto. But in

relation to this matter, we thought the judge should have heard the evidence before she

made the finding that the allegation of BCH that a customer who bought Fragrance’s

product had come to make an exchange at a BCH outlet could not be true. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Conclusion</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31        For

the above reasons, we came to the conclusion that it was not appropriate to grant summary

judgment in this case. We agree that if the suggested defence in a case is on a point of

law and the court can see that the point is misconceived or unsustainable, judgment should

be given. But this is not such a case. There are factual matters here which have to be

gone into and difficult questions of law which require mature consideration. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32        

However, there is one other circumstance which we think also suggest that this is a case

which ought to go for trial. The main object of summary judgment is to prevent delay and

to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment where there is plainly no defence to the

claim: see <i>Thompson v Marshall</i> (1880) 41 LTR 720, <i>European Asian Bank AG v

Pubjab and Sind Bank (No.2) </i>[1983] 1 WLR 642 at 654 per Robert Goff LJ and <i>Home and

Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (In Liquidation</i>) [1990] 1 WLR

153 at 158 per Parker LJ. Here, the summary judgment granted by the court below was only

in respect of a part of the action. There will still have to be a trial in respect of the

trade mark infringement claim. As the claim in copyright is so closely linked with the

claim in trade mark, there is really little advantage in granting summary judgment for the

copyright claim alone. There will hardly be any saving in terms of time and effort. The

fact that the judge below in granting the summary judgment added a rider that there be no

execution until trial and had refused to grant an order as to damages for the infringement

is clear indication of the close connection between the two claims. Moreover, it also

seems to us that the claim for copyright infringement was viewed very much by the judge

below as incidental to the main claim for trade mark infringement, as she did not grant an

order for an inquiry as to damages in respect of the copyright infringement.</font></p>
