Two of the containers were 40 feet long by eight feet wide and the other two were 20 feet long by eight feet wide.

</div> The defendant claimed $1.20 per square foot as a reasonable rental to charge in this case. How the plaintiff used the space was not relevant. I noted also that it was clear from the evidence that the defendant had permitted the plaintiff to operate from the Pioneer premises for all of its work including work for other customers. Third, the proposed increase of 14% was based on nothing more than an assumption that the plaintiff spent at least one day per week doing work for other customers,

In his testimony, Balan explained that the figure of $2,500 per month was computed based on 30% of the average expenses incurred by the defendant per month at the Pioneer premises for electricity, water, diesel, and yard maintenance (which included sewerage and clearing of drains). Balan admitted that 30% was his own estimate based on what he claimed he knew.

</div> No other details were given to substantiate his claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my view, the defendant’s claim of $2,500 per month was at best, speculative. There was no basis upon which I could reasonably attribute to the plaintiff a 30% share of the defendant’s utilities expenses. In fact, the evidence also raised serious doubts about the reliability of Balan’s estimate of 30%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 First, even based on the defendant’s case, the total area occupied by the plaintiff at the Pioneer premises was a mere 1.2% of the total area of the Pioneer premises. This was of course not in itself evidence of what the plaintiff’s share of the utility charges should be. However, in my view, it was some indication as to the speculative nature of Balan’s estimate of 30%. Further, it was clear that the defendant itself accepted that it was reasonable to pro-rate expenses based on the area occupied. The defendant’s financial statements showed its total expenses for water and electricity for the Pioneer premises as well as the defendant’s other premises at the Benoi Sector depot.

</div>
</div> Based on Balan’s evidence, assuming three drums of diesel per week, the amount of diesel used by the plaintiff per month would have been about 432 litres, which was less than 4% of the tank capacity. Of course, the relevant comparison is not against the capacity of the tank but the total volume of diesel used. However, no evidence was produced as to the total volume of diesel used at the Pioneer premises although the defendant had to have had that information. For example, the average amount of diesel purchased periodically to fill the tank could have given some indication of the total average volume of diesel used monthly. However, the defendant chose simply to attribute 30% to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Fourth, the defendant could also have adduced evidence of the utility bills incurred by the defendant at the Pioneer premises after the plaintiff left the premises. Assuming no other changes in circumstances, that could have given some indication at least of the amount that should be attributed to the plaintiff. Inexplicably, no such evidence was adduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The burden of proof was again squarely on the defendant. The defendant failed to discharge this burden. In my view, the allocation of 30% of the defendant’s expenses for utilities to the plaintiff, was completely arbitrary. I decided that the appropriate order was for the plaintiff to pay for his use of utilities at a nominal rate of $100 per month. As the counterclaim for utilities charges was again based on contract, it was subject to the six-year limitation period under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act. The defendant’s counterclaim for utilities charges was thus limited to the period from January 2011 until November 2016, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 70 months. The total amount that the plaintiff had to pay therefore worked out to $7,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Accordingly, I entered judgment for the defendant on its counterclaim in the sum of $69,784 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ until judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unjust enrichment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As stated at [27] above, the defendant pleaded an alternative claim for rental and utilities charged based on unjust enrichment. In my view, the alternative claim based on unjust enrichment must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 There is no freestanding claim in unjust enrichment on the abstract basis that the retention of the benefit is “unjust” – there must be a particular recognised unjust factor or event which gives rise to a claim: <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another</span> [2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [134]. It is not sufficient simply to assert that the retention of the benefit is unjust: <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span> at [136]. Yet, this was precisely all that the defendant pleaded with respect to its alternative claim in unjust enrichment. It was only in its closing submissions that the defendant raised an alleged lack of consent as the unjust factor in support of its unjust enrichment claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The defendant referred me to <span class="font-italic">AAHG, LLC v Hong Hin Kay Albert</span> [2017] 3 SLR 636 in which I expressed the view (at [74]) that lack of consent should be recognised as an unjust factor. The Court of Appeal has not ruled on this point.<span class="font-italic"> </span>However, what is more important in the present case is that the defendant did not plead lack of consent as the unjust factor that it was relying on.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In any event, the findings that I have made clearly do not support any lack of consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In its closing submissions, the defendant made two other submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the defendant referred to <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal </span>[2016] 4 SLR 728 (“<span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35] for the proposition that a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> claim exists as part of the law of unjust enrichment and that recovery of compensation for work done where there is no express contract may be made on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis.

There was no need to resort to the law of unjust enrichment. As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong</span> at [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there are two alternative approaches toward the award of a reasonable sum for work done.

The second is premised on <span class="font-italic">restitution or </span><span class="font-italic">unjust enrichment</span> (the more historical basis being that of <span class="font-italic">quasi-contract</span>).

The amount awarded to the defendant was larger than that awarded to the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s claim was relatively straightforward whereas the defendant’s counterclaim involved more issues. All other things being equal, it would be reasonable to expect that any costs awarded to the defendant in respect of its counterclaim would be higher than the costs awarded to the plaintiff on its claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 However, the defendant failed to prove many of its allegations. The defendant failed to prove the agreement which it alleged existed. Instead, it was Deen’s evidence (given as witness for the plaintiff) that provided the basis for the plaintiff’s liability to pay rent for the additional space occupied by it and for its use of utilities. The defendant also failed to prove the area which it alleged was occupied by the plaintiff, and the share of utilities charges which it alleged should be borne by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendant had scant regard for its obligation to produce evidence to substantiate its allegations. It came to court without making the effort to produce relevant evidence. The defendant cannot expect this court to simply accept Balan’s estimates which were arbitrary and unsubstantiated. The defendant’s conduct of this case has in my view caused unnecessary effort and time to be spent by all involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Taking the above circumstances into consideration, in my judgment, this was an appropriate case for an order that each party should bear its own costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For the above reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I entered judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $17.632.50 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I entered judgment for the defendant on its counterclaim in the sum of $69,784 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I ordered each party to bear its own costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nadiah Li Feng binte Mahmood (Kim &amp; Co.) for the plaintiff <br/>by original action and defendant in the counterclaim;<br/>Mohamed Nawaz Kamil and Wong Joon Wee <br/>(Providence Law Asia LLC) for the defendant<br/> by original action and plaintiff in counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
