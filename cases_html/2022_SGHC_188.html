</div>
</div> He therefore accepts that the plaintiff complied with all of the applicable provisions of the Rules in applying for and entering the Judgment. There is therefore no basis to set this judgment aside under O 2 r 1(2) on grounds of procedural irregularity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, the Judgment is a final judgment. I entered the Judgment under O 27 r 3. That rule gives the court the power to enter judgment summarily (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without a trial) upon a party’s “clear admission of facts in the face of which it is impossible for the party making it to succeed” (<span class="font-italic">Ellis v Allen</span> [1914] 1 Ch D 904 at 909). Order 27 r 3 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judgment on admission of facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. Where admissions of fact are made by a party to a cause or matter either by his pleadings or otherwise, any other party to the cause or matter may apply to the Court for such judgment or order as upon those admissions he may be entitled to, without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties, and the Court may give such judgment, or make such order, on the application as it thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Judgment is entered under O 27 r 3 on the basis that the defendant has admitted that the facts relating to his liability are not in issue. The court is therefore entitled to enter judgment without having to make any findings of fact (<span class="font-italic">Shunmugam</span><span class="font-italic"> Jayakumar and others v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and others</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 658 at [35]). The purpose of allowing a plaintiff to enter judgment on admission of facts is to save time and costs (<span class="font-italic">Cove Development Pte Ltd v Ideal Accommodation (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2009] SGHC 167 at [13]; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 27/0/2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, the Judgment is a judgment on the merits. It is true that the Defendants failed to file a defence to the plaintiff’s claim. It is also true that the Defendants were absent at the hearing of the plaintiff’s O 27 application. But it would be wrong to characterise a judgment under O 27 r 3 as a default judgment. A default judgment is one entered purely by reason of a procedural default such as a failure to file a defence. A judgment entered under O 27 r 3 is entered after a consideration of the merits of the plaintiff’s case in light of the defendant’s admission of facts. I put it to the first defendant’s counsel in the course of arguments that O 27 r 3 requires the court to consider the merits of the plaintiff’s claim before it enters judgment. Counsel quite rightly conceded that that is correct.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Indeed, on an application under O 27 r 3, the plaintiff must satisfy the court that the facts which the defendant has admitted establish all the elements of the plaintiff’s pleaded cause of action, failing which the court will refuse to enter judgment under O 27 r 3 (<span class="font-italic">Mycitydeal</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Villas International Property Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 1077 at [69]). It is thus open to the court to decline to enter judgment under O 27 r 3 on the basis that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment, even on the facts as admitted by the defendant. Furthermore, it is open to a court hearing an application under O 27 r 3 to enter judgment in the plaintiff’s favour on the basis of the admissions, but to reject or modify some of the heads of relief which the plaintiff claims. The court has that power whether the admissions are historical admissions or are made in the course of the proceedings. It also has that power whether the admissions are made expressly or are deemed by the Rules to have been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The admissions on which the plaintiff relied on its O 27 application were deemed admissions. Under O 18 r 13, the Defendants’ failure to traverse the facts alleged in the plaintiff’s statement of claim constituted a deemed admission of those facts (see <span class="font-italic">Zulkifli</span><span class="font-italic"> Baharudin v Koh Lam Son</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 369). I entered the Judgment because, in light of those deemed admissions, the plaintiff satisfied me that it had established all of the elements of the causes of action it had pleaded against the Defendants and that it was entitled to enter judgment against the Defendants in terms of the prayers in its O 27 application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I reiterate that the Judgment was a regular judgment, a final judgment and a judgment entered against the first defendant on the merits. It was not a judgment entered upon a default, nor was it in any sense a judgment entered only provisionally. The Judgment adjudicated the plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants and rendered the subject matter of this action <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, at least in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Neptune Capital Group Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1177 at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The application to set aside the Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In August 2021, the first defendant applied to set the Judgment aside as against him. That was over 16 months after I had entered the Judgment and after the first defendant had become aware of the Judgment (see [159]–[160] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The second and fourth defendants have not applied to set aside the Judgment as against them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The first defendant’s submissions in support of his setting aside application make three principal points. First, the court has the power under O 32 r 6, alternatively under the inherent power of the court preserved by O 92 r 4, to set the Judgment aside. Second, all of the first defendant’s procedural lapses in this action – failing to file a defence in December 2019, failing to attend the hearing of the plaintiff’s O 27 application in March 2020 and failing to bring this setting aside application as soon as he became aware of the Judgment – are due to significant financial difficulties he experienced from 2016 to 2021

</div> Second, that a judgment or order made at a hearing conducted in the absence of a party is “made ex parte” within the meaning of O 32, r 6 even if that party was duly served with the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I reject both propositions. For the reasons which follow, I hold that within the meaning of O 32 r 6: (a) a judgment is not an “order”; and (b) the Judgment was not “made ex parte”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A judgment is not an “order”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 A judgment and an order do, of course, have several common features. They are both a formal adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in the course of litigation which carries the force of law. Thus, both represent the court’s ruling or determination on a matter in dispute (<span class="font-italic">Woo Koon Chee v Scandinavian Boiler Service (Asia) Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1213 at [26] and [28]). Both establish legal consequences. And, in both cases, those legal consequences may be enforced through the coercive power of the state.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Despite these common features, there remains a fundamental distinction between a judgment and an order. At common law, a judgment is an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction upon a cause of action, which: (a) terminates the litigation or a defined part of it in relation to that cause of action; and (b) determines the cause of action or a defined part of it conclusively as between the parties to the litigation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> in a manner which the parties cannot thereafter dispute or reopen before that court. An order is any formal adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction which is not a judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As a result of this fundamental distinction, judgments have certain legal consequences which orders do not. Only a judgment can give rise to merger. When a court of record enters judgment in litigation before it in favour of a plaintiff, the cause of action which was the subject matter of the litigation merges into the judgment, <span class="font-italic">transit in rem </span><span class="font-italic">judicatam</span> (<span class="font-italic">Republic of India v India Steamship Co</span> [1993] AC 410 at 417H). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The result of a merger is that the inferior rights comprised in a cause of action thereby cease to have any independent existence and are merged into and replaced by the higher rights conferred by the judgment (<span class="font-italic">King v Hoare</span> (1844) 13 M&amp;W 494 at 504; <span class="font-italic">Blair v Curran</span> (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532; <span class="font-italic">Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd</span> [2014] AC 160 at [17]). The rights conferred by the judgment are higher rights because they have vindicated the plaintiff’s cause of action with certainty and in a manner which carries the force of law. The rights merged into the judgment were inferior rights because they were merely private rights, and which carried no certainty that they would be vindicated. A mere order cannot and does not give rise to any form of merger.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Only a judgment can render its subject-matter <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. A <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> gives rise to both cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel. Those two estoppels preclude re-litigation of the rights which have merged into the judgment and also relitigation of the issues necessary for the court’s adjudication upon those rights. It is true that a future attempt to relitigate the subject matter of an order may be an abuse of process, particularly if there has been no change in the relevant underlying circumstances. But it remains the fact that a mere order cannot and does not give rise to any form of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Only a judgment can give rise to an implied obligation under the general civil law to comply with its terms. This implied obligation amounts to a new and freestanding cause of action in the civil law, arising from the judgment itself (<span class="font-italic">Williams v Jones</span> (1845) 13 M&amp;W 627 at 633). A judgment can therefore be enforced by commencing an action on the judgment in another court (typically but not necessarily a foreign court) in addition to the more common mode of levying execution upon it in the same court. An order can be enforced only by levying execution upon it. A mere order cannot and does not give rise to any form of implied obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Even though the Rules do not define the terms “judgment”<br/> and “order” expressly, the Rules do observe the distinction I have drawn. The Rules use the word “judgment” only in the sense I have defined it (see [40] above): see O 13 rr 7 and 8, O 19 r 8A and 9, O 70 r 20, O 73 r 7, O 79 r 4 and O 83 r 4 (judgment in default); O 14 rr 3, 5 and 11 and O 73 r 5 (summary judgment); O 15 r 16 (declaratory judgment); O 16 r 7 (judgment between defendant and third party); O 27 r 3 (judgment on admission of facts); O 29 r 17 (adjustment of interim payments on final judgment); O 35 r 2 (setting aside judgment given at trial in the absence of a party); O 35 r 6 (death of a party before court gives judgment), O 37 r 3 (assessment of damages in default of appearance or defence); O 48 r 2 (examination of party liable to satisfy judgment); O 55C r 3 and O 55D r 18 (enforcement of judgments which have been the subject-matter of appeal); O 56A r 22 and O 57 r 19 (judgment of an appellate court); O 59 r 10 (signing judgment for costs without order); O 67 (reciprocal enforcement of judgments); O 74 r 5 (arrest of debtor before judgment); O 74 r 8 (mode of seizure before judgment); O 74 rr 13 and 14 (judgment notice); O 95 r 3 (setting aside judgment under the Building And Construction Industry Security Of Payment Act) and O 111 (proceedings under the Choice of Courts Agreement Act 2016). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Rules also recognise that judgments are distinct from orders: see O 42 rr 1 to 6 and O 45 (dealing only with judgments), O 42 r 9 (dealing only with orders) and O 42 rr 7, 8, 10 and 11 (dealing with both judgments and orders).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Further, where the Rules intend the word “order” to encompass judgments in a particular context, express provision is made to that effect. Examples are O 73 r 1(2) and O 90 r 1. These rules set out for the purposes of O 73 and O 90 respectively an extended definition of “order” which includes a judgment. These extended definitions would not have been necessary if the Rules intended the word “order” to encompass a judgment by default. To put it another way, for the first defendant’s argument to succeed, there would have to be an extended definition of “order” in O 32 equivalent to those found in O 73 r 1(2) and O 90 r 1. But there is none.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is true that, in at least one specific case, the context of a rule compels the conclusion that the word “order” was intended to encompass a judgment. As the first defendant points out, O 34A r 6(1) empowers a court to enter judgment or make such order as the court thinks fit if one or more parties fails to attend a pre-trial conference. The express power in the very next subrule, O 34A r 6(2), refers only to the court’s power to set aside an order and not a judgment. But this power must necessarily extend to a judgment entered under O 34A r 6(1). No doubt, in that specific case, the word “order” in O 34A r 6(2) must be construed as encompassing a judgment entered under O 34A r 6(1). But that is only because the direct relationship between O 34A r 6(1) and its companion rule in O 34A r 6(2) compels that construction. That does not detract from the distinction which the Rules draw consistently between these two terms everywhere else, as I have set out at [46] to [48] above. Unlike O 34A r 6, there is no companion rule to O 32 r 6, or any other legislative context within O 32, which compels the word “order” in O 32 r 6 to be construed as encompassing a judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The first defendant also points out that, like O 27 r 3, the following rules allow a court to enter judgment against a party but make no express provision for any such judgment to be set aside: O 18 r 19, O 24 r 16(1), O 25 r 3(2), O 26 r 6(1) and O 33 r 5. The first defendant’s submission is that, unless the word “order” in O 32 r 6 is interpreted as encompassing a judgment, an appeal is the only avenue of recourse for a party who suffers a judgment under any of these rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I accept that that is the consequence of the distinction I have drawn between judgments and orders. But there is nothing onerous about that consequence. Where a party enters judgment under any of these rules without giving the opposing party reasonable notice of the hearing at which the judgment was entered, the judgment would be irregular and would be liable to be set aside on that ground alone under O 2 r 1(2). But if a party enters a regular judgment against an opposing party under any of these rules, an appeal against the judgment is the natural and only recourse as it would be for any other type of judgment entered <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The first defendant cites <span class="font-italic">BSD v Attorney General</span> [2019] SGHC 118 (“<span class="font-italic">BSD</span>”) (at [52]) and the title of O 32 – “Applications and Proceedings in Chambers” – as support for his submission that O 32 r 6 is a provision of general application, applying to both judgments and orders. Order 32 r 6 is indeed a provision of general application, but only in the sense that it applies <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> to all orders made in chambers in all proceedings of all types, not in the sense that it applies to both judgments and orders. In <span class="font-italic">BSD</span>, Chua Lee Ming J held that O 32 r 6 – being a provision of general application – did not govern who may apply to set aside a production order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (Cap 190A, 2001 Ed) because there was a specific provision in O 89B r 2(2) which governed that issue. That does not assist the first defendant in his argument that the word “order” in O 32 r 6 was intended to encompass a judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The first defendant cites the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Damai</span><span class="font-italic"> Laut Golf Resort Sdn Bhd v Sim Mee Yong (t/a Messrs Kantan Jaya)</span> [2000] 6 MLJ 487 as authority for the proposition that O 32 r 6 applies to judgments.

</div>
</div> A close reading of that case shows that the submission is misconceived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In that case, on a striking out application by the defendant, a deputy registrar of the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur ordered that the action be transferred to the lower courts. The plaintiff appealed against the transfer order to a judge in chambers. At the hearing of the appeal, the plaintiff’s counsel was present, but the defendants’ counsel was absent. The judge proceeded in the absence of the defendant’s counsel and allowed the appeal. Although the report of this case refers to the judge giving “judgment” in favour of the plaintiff on the merits, that clearly means in context that he allowed the registrar’s appeal on the merits of the appeal and set aside the transfer order. It does not mean that he entered judgment for the plaintiff on the merits of the action, thereby bringing the action to an end with finality and with a <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> in favour of the plaintiff. The real dispute in that case was whether the Malaysian equivalent of O 32 r 6 applied only to proceedings in chambers before a deputy registrar or whether it also applied to proceedings in chambers before a judge, such as a registrar’s appeal. This case does not assist the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For these reasons, I hold that the word “order” in O 32 r 6 cannot be construed as encompassing a judgment. To that extent, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the subject matter of O 32 r 6 is any order made in proceedings apart from a final judgment on the merits.

The architecture of the Rules demonstrates that an order is “made ex parte” within the meaning of O 32 r 6 if the order is made on an application: (a) which the Rules expressly permit the applicant to make <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>; or (b) which was not served on a non-party affected by the order made on the application. An order which is made on an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> application which is duly served on all of the parties to the application and on all of the non-parties affected by the order is not an order “made ex parte” within the meaning of O 32 r 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 An application under O 27 r 3 is not one of the classes of applications which the Rules expressly permit to be made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>. These are typically applications: (a) made at an early stage before the court has taken jurisdiction over a defendant (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> O 11 r 2(1) and O 16 r 2(1)); (b) made in circumstances where service is impracticable (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> O 10 r 4); (c) made in circumstances of urgency or where proceeding <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> would defeat the purpose of the application (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> O 29 r 1(2)); (d) made in circumstances where the opposing party’s substantive rights have already been determined and therefore the applying party can be taken <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> to be entitled to the relief it seeks (O 46 r 3(1), O 69 r 3(3) and O 69A r 3(3); or (e) which are non-controversial or administrative in nature (O 67 r 13).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Because the Rules do not permit an application under O 27 r 3 to be made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>, an application to enter judgment under O 27 r 3 must be made <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span>. A party who seeks to enter judgment under O 27 r 3 must therefore take out an application seeking that relief under O 32 r 1, set out the evidential basis for the application in the supporting affidavit and serve both on the opposing party as prescribed by O 32 r 3. This procedure is designed to give reasonable notice to the opposing party: (a) of the date fixed for the hearing of the O 27 application; and (b) of the case the opposing party has to meet in order to avoid judgment being entered against it at that hearing. This is simply an implementation of the <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span> rule of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The first defendant accepts that the plaintiff complied with these requirements in relation to its O 27 application.

</div> The principle of <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span> did not require the plaintiff to go beyond that and to ensure that the Defendants actually attended and opposed the O 27 application on 4 March 2020 in person or by counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The first defendant was not deprived of a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the O 27 application. The plaintiff afforded him that reasonable opportunity. The first defendant simply failed to grasp that opportunity, even if only to ask for an adjournment. His failure to grasp the opportunity did not turn the hearing of the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> O 27 application into an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application let alone make the Judgment one which was “made ex parte” within the meaning of O 32 r 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In support of his submission, the first defendant cites the decision of the Federal Court on appeal from the High Court of Malaya at Singapore in <span class="font-italic">United </span><span class="font-italic">Overseas Bank Ltd v Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</span> [1968-1970] SLR(R) 194 (“<span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span>”). The first defendant relies on this decision as authority for the proposition that an order made on an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> application which is duly served on the respondent to the application, but which is heard in the respondent’s absence, is an order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order within the meaning of O 32 r 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I do not accept this submission. To explain why, it is necessary to consider the facts of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> in greater detail. The issue before the Federal Court in <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> was which of two banks had a prior interest over the other in certain real property owned by a defendant as a result of two orders made in the two sets of proceedings against the same defendant in respect of the same real property. The first set of proceedings was commenced by United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”). The second set of proceedings was commenced by Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd (“CKB”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The chronology of the two sets of proceedings is important and is as follows. In June 1966, in the first set of proceedings, UOB entered final judgment against the defendant for over $370,000 (<span class="font-italic">UOB </span><span class="font-italic">v CKB</span> at [2]). In October 1966, UOB secured an order attaching certain real property owned by the defendant in satisfaction of the judgment debt. The very next day, UOB duly registered the attachment against the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Meanwhile, in September 1966, CKB commenced the second set of proceedings by way of originating summons seeking a declaration that CKB was the legal mortgagee of the same real property that UOB would go on to attach in October 1966 (<span class="font-italic">UOB </span><span class="font-italic">v CKB</span> at [3] and [5]). CKB duly served the originating summons on the defendant. The defendant failed to enter an appearance. In November 1966, CKB’s originating summons came up for hearing (<span class="font-italic">UOB </span><span class="font-italic">v CKB</span> at [3]). The defendant was absent. UOB, not being a party to CKB’s application, had no notice of the hearing at all. At that hearing, CKB entered judgment against the defendant (<span class="font-italic">UOB </span><span class="font-italic">v CKB</span> at [5]). In January 1967, CKB duly registered its judgment against the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The two banks discovered each other’s competing claims but were unable to come to any agreement as to priority. As a result, UOB applied in CKB’s originating summons to set aside CKB’s judgment against the debtor (<span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB </span>at [11(c)]). UOB brought this application under O LIII r 4(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1934 (“the 1934 Rules”) as a <span class="font-italic">non-party</span> affected by the judgment in favour of CKB. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Order LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> may be varied or set aside on application, by any person affected by it, to a judge, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as to the judge seem fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Order LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules is quite obviously the precursor of O 32 r 6 of the current Rules. Although the two provisions are not identically worded, I accept them to be <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> for present purposes (see also <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien v Chan Shwe Ching </span>[2018] 4 SLR 208 at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 At first instance in <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> (reported <span class="font-italic">sub nom</span> <span class="font-italic">Chung </span><span class="font-italic">Khiaw Bank Ltd v Tay Soo Tong (United Overseas Bank Ltd, applicant</span>) [1968-1970] SLR(R) 68), Winslow J dismissed UOB’s application. He did so for two principal reasons. First, the judgment which CKB had entered against the defendant was not an order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> within the meaning of O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules because the defendant had been duly served. It was instead a judgment in default of appearance, and therefore had a bespoke regime for setting aside governed by O XIII of the 1934 Rules. Second, UOB was not a “person affected by” the judgment within the meaning of O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules. UOB had suffered no injury directly under CKB’s judgment. UOB therefore had no standing to apply to set CKB’s judgment aside under O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On UOB’s appeal, the Federal Court reversed Winslow J’s decision and set aside CKB’s judgment. The Federal Court did so for two reasons. First, it held that an order is “made ex parte” within the meaning of under O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules if a party fails to appear at the hearing of the application on which the order was made, even if that party was duly served with the application (at [21]). Second, UOB was a “person affected by” CKB’s judgment within the meaning of the rule because UOB had already registered its attachment when CKB’s originating summons came on for hearing. UOB therefore had acquired priority over CKB’s as-yet unregistered mortgage (at [28]). As such, UOB was “an essential party to [CKB’s] originating summons and clearly were persons affected by the order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> within the meaning of” the rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> does not assist the first defendant. The two most important points to note about the case are that: (a) the defendant was duly served with CKB’s originating summons; and (b) it was UOB who applied to set aside CKB’s judgment, not the defendant. <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> is therefore authority as to the status of CKB’s judgment <span class="font-italic">as against</span><span class="font-italic"> UOB</span>, as a non-party to the proceedings affected by the judgment. That is not the issue before me now. The issue before me now is the status of a judgment entered against a duly served but absent defendant. <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> is not authority on that issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 UOB succeeded in its application because the Federal Court accepted that UOB was a non-party affected by CKB’s judgment, but who had had no notice of CKB’s application. That is the basis on which the Federal Court held that UOB had a right to apply in CKB’s proceedings to set CKB’s judgment aside under O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules. Indeed, the Federal Court went so far as to hold that that CKB’s judgment could not stand <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> debito justitiae</span> (at [29]) <span class="font-italic">as against UOB</span>. The Federal Court did not have to consider, and did not therefore consider, whether CKB’s judgment could or should stand <span class="font-italic">as against the defendant</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 To put it another way, I have no doubt that the application to set aside CKB’s judgment under Order LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules would have failed in either of the following two situations: (a) if it had been the defendant applying to set the judgment aside instead of UOB; or (b) if UOB had been given an opportunity to appear and present arguments when CKB secured its judgment against the defendant. In both those cases, there would be no grounds for setting the judgment aside under O LIII r 4(1) of the Rules, even if there were other grounds under O XIII or some other provision of the Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I therefore do not consider <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> to be authority for the proposition that an order made at the hearing of an application which takes place in the absence of a party who has been duly served with the application is an order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> within the meaning of O 32 r 6. I concede that that is what the Federal Court appears to say in the following <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> (<span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> at [21]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 It is clear then that a judge may proceed <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> to hear an application where a party duly served fails to appear at the time appointed for the hearing. An application so heard in the absence of a party is not an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application. It is the hearing which is <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> and an order made on such a hearing is an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order within the terms of O LIII r 4(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">But I make two points about this <span class="font-italic">dictum</span>. First, reading it in the context of the facts of <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span>, the substance of the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> is that the hearing of CKB’s application to enter judgment against the defendant was <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> <span class="font-italic">as against UOB</span>, not that it was <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> <span class="font-italic">as against the defendant</span>. Second, in so far as the Federal Court did intend to characterise the hearing of CKB’s application as being <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> as against the defendant, that characterisation was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> and does not, with respect, bind me. As I have said, the issue before the Federal Court was whether a <span class="font-italic">non-party</span> to the proceedings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> UOB, who was <span class="font-italic">not</span> served with CKB’s originating summons could apply in CKB’s proceedings to have CKB’s judgment set aside under the precursor of O 32 r 6. The issue before the Federal Court was not<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">the defendant’s</span> right to set aside CKB’s judgment under that rule. That is the issue which is now before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 This is a significant point. An order made on an application which the Rules permit the applicant to make <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> is completely different from an order made on an application which the Rules require the applicant to make <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> and which is duly served on the respondent to the application, even if the respondent fails to attend the hearing of the application. Order 32 r 6 is intended to cater for the former situation, not the latter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 An applicant who secures an order on an application which the Rules permit him to make <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> secures that order even though the respondent has been deprived of his right to be heard. The purpose of O 32 r 6 in that context is to restore to the respondent his right to be heard, albeit after the order is made rather than before. As Sir John Donaldson MR made clear in <span class="font-italic">WEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd</span> [1983] 1 WLR 721 (“<span class="font-italic">WEA Records Ltd</span>”), the conceptual basis for a right to apply to set aside an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order is because that order was made by the court with the benefit of only one party’s evidence and submissions (at 727):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As I have said, ex parte orders are essentially provisional in nature. <span class="font-italic">They are made by the judge </span><span class="font-italic">on the basis of evidence and submissions emanating from one side only</span>. Despite the fact that the applicant is under a duty to make full disclosure of all relevant information in his possession, whether or not it assists his application, this is no basis for making a definitive order and every judge knows this. <span class="font-italic">He expects at a later stage to be given an opportunity to review his provisional order in the light of evidence and argument adduced by the other side</span> and, in so doing, he is not hearing an appeal from himself and in no way feels inhibited from discharging or varying his original order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In that sense, and only in that sense, an order made on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application can be said to be provisional and not final: because it is made subject to the respondent’s right to be heard in opposition to it and may, when that right is exercised, be set aside by the same court which made it. Until and unless the order is set aside, however, it has the force of law. But the respondent is allowed a right to apply to the same court to set aside the order because his right to be heard, albeit postponed, still prevails over the interest in finality in litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On the other hand, an applicant who secures an order on an application which the Rules require him to make <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> and who duly serves the application on the respondent does not deprive the respondent of his right to be heard. If the respondent chooses, for whatever reason, to be absent at the hearing and not to exercise that right, that does not in any way put him in the same position as the respondent to an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application. In this situation, the respondent’s right to be heard is not engaged. The interest in finality in litigation simply prevails over the defendant’s failure to exercise a right to be heard which was afforded to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Sundaresh Menon JC (as the Chief Justice then was) captured this point in <span class="font-italic">Karaha</span><span class="font-italic"> Bodas Co LLC v Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 345 (at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 Order 32 r 6 simply provides that the court may set aside an order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> … In the case of the usual order of court, the interest of finality in litigation mandates that the only way in which such an order may be challenged is by an appeal. However the nature of an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order is such that it is provisional in nature. … <span class="font-italic">this provisional nature derives from the fact that the court has moved upon hearing one party only</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 If the first defendant’s submission were correct, every order made on an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> application would be liable to be set aside under O 32 r 6 simply because the respondent to the application absented himself from the hearing despite being served with it. That would be a recipe for procedural chaos. That cannot have been the intention and cannot be the effect of O 32 r 6.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the foregoing reasons, I hold that I have no power to set aside the Judgment under O 32 r 6. To read O 32 r 6 as applying to the Judgment would be wholly contradictory to the sharp distinction which the Rules draw between judgments and orders and also between orders made <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> and orders made <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I should also add that I do not accept that <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span> is authority for the proposition that a judgment is an “order” within the meaning of O 32 r 6. I say that for two reasons. First, for the reasons I have already given, it is clear that the architecture of the Rules as they stand today draws a sharp distinction between an “order” and a “judgment”. That is so whatever may have been the position under the 1934 Rules. Second, the scope of the word “order” was not a point on which the Federal Court heard argument in <span class="font-italic">UOB v CKB</span>. The Federal Court therefore merely assumed that a judgment was an “order” within the meaning of O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Judgment is a final determination on the merits of the parties’ substantive rights. It renders those rights <span class="font-italic">res judicat</span><span class="font-italic">a</span> in Singapore. It can be dissolved only by an appellate court, not by the court which made it (<span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy</span><span class="font-italic"> Asad v Aw Cheok Huat Mick and others</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 99 at [7]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">No inherent power to set aside the Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The first defendant’s next submission is that I have an inherent power preserved by O 92 r 4 to set the Judgment aside. I do not accept this submission either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In my view, the architecture of the Rules excludes any such inherent power. Where the Rules wish to confer a right on a respondent to an application to apply to set aside a regular judgment or order made on that application on the ground that the respondent was absent or failed to appear at the hearing of the application, the Rules do so by an express provision to that effect. Examples of these express provisions are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Order 14 rule 11, permitting a party who did not appear at the hearing of an application for summary judgment to apply to set aside the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Order 28 rule 4(1), permitting a defendant who did not appear at the hearing of an originating summons to apply to have the originating summons reheard. This necessarily requires that the judgment entered by the court on the first hearing of the originating summons be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Order 34A rule 1(4), permitting a party who did not appear when directed to do so at a pre-trial conference to apply to have any judgment, order or direction given at the pre-trial conference set aside or varied. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Order 35 rule 2, permitting a party who did not appear when a trial of an action is called on to apply to set aside any judgment or order made at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Order 55D rule 15(3), O 56A r 21(3) and O 57 r 18(3) permitting a party who did not appear when an appeal was heard to apply to have the appeal reheard. This necessarily requires that the judgment entered by the appellate court on the first hearing of the appeal be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Order 70 rule 18(6), permitting a defendant who did not appear on a plaintiff’s application for judgment in default of filing a preliminary act in admiralty proceedings to set aside a judgment entered on that application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 If the defendant’s submission were correct, none of these express provisions would be necessary. In each case covered by these express provisions, the party who was absent or who failed to appear could simply invoke the court’s inherent power to set aside the regular judgment or order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I should also note in passing that these express provisions are another reason for rejecting the first defendant’s submission that “order” in O 32 r 6 is capable of encompassing a judgment and that an order is “made ex parte” within the meaning of O 32 r 6 so long as the respondent to the application is absent when the application is heard, whether or not the respondent was duly served. If that were true, there would equally be no need for these express provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The architecture of the Rules, in my view, leaves no room for an inherent power to set aside a judgment or order on the ground that the respondent was absent when the application was heard despite having been duly served with the application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The first defendant submits that there is a lacuna in O 27 because it does not contain an express provision allowing a defendant to set aside a judgment under O 27 r 3 on the grounds that the defendant was absent at the hearing, whether or not duly served.

</div> He submits, further, that this <span class="font-italic">lacuna</span> ought to be remedied by recognising an inherent power to set aside a judgment which is entered under O 27 r 3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I do not accept this submission for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 First, the existence of the express provisions I have listed at [84] above indicates to me that the omission of an equivalent express provision in O 27 must have been deliberate. Given that deliberate omission, recognising an inherent power to set such a judgment aside would, it appears to me, subvert the legislative intent of the Rules. Further, my interpretation of the Rules does not leave a respondent in that situation without recourse. It simply means that the respondent’s only recourse is by way of appeal to an appellate court and not to the court which entered the judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, the first defendant’s submission is circular in that it assumes what it seeks to establish. It assumes that there must be a power to set aside a judgment under O 27 r 3 and then characterises the absence of that power as a lacuna to be filled by recognising the court’s inherent power to do so. That is not the correct approach. If that were the correct approach, it would have the capacity to subvert the Rules entirely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For all of these reasons, it appears to me that it is not possible to recognise the inherent power which the first defendant advocates without subverting the architecture and legislative intent of the Rules.

Any such countervailing factors would necessarily have to be very compelling to tilt the balance in favour of setting aside the judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I gratefully adopt this synthesis of these principles for the purposes of the application before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Chua J speaks in his synthesis of two classes of judgments: one class entered without a trial (at [59]) and the other class entered after a trial (at [60]). The question then is whether the Judgment falls into the framework set out in [59] or in [60] of <span class="font-italic">First Property</span>. In my view, the Judgment falls into the framework set out in [60]. That is so even though the Judgment is not one which was entered against the first defendant after a trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I arrive at this conclusion because I do not read the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> or <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">u Sh-Hsyu</span> and Chua J’s synthesis at [59] and [60] of <span class="font-italic">First Property</span> as drawing a dividing line between judgments entered without a trial and judgments entered after a trial. If that were the true dividing line, judgments entered in a writ action under O 13 rr 1 to 6, O 14 r 3, O 18 r 19(1), O 19 rr 2 to 7, O 24 r 6(1), O 27 r 3 and judgments entered on an originating summons or upon breach of an unless order would all fall within the framework set out in [59] of <span class="font-italic">First Property</span> simply because they would have all been entered with no trial of the plaintiff’s claim.

</div>
</div> In the former class of cases, the merits of the defence are the dominant feature (see <span class="font-italic">Su </span><span class="font-italic">Sh-Hsyu</span> at [43]). That is simply because the court did not consider those merits before entering judgment against the defendant. Where the court did consider the merits before entering judgment, the merits recede into the background and the predominant consideration is the interest in finality in litigation, bringing to the fore the reasons for the defendant’s delay, absence or default when judgment was entered (<span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">u Sh-Hsyu</span> at [44]). That is because the merits have already been considered once.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 On this basis, judgments entered under O 13 rr 1 to 6, O 19 rr 2 to 7, O 24 r 16(1) and an unless order come within the framework set out in [59] of <span class="font-italic">First Property</span>. And judgments entered under O 14 r 3, O 18 r 19(1), O 27 r 3, O 35 r 1(2) and on an originating summons come within the framework set out in [60] of <span class="font-italic">First Property</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I therefore consider that the appropriate framework for the first defendant’s application to set aside the Judgment is that set out in [60] of <span class="font-italic">First Property</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Su </span><span class="font-italic">Sh-Hsyu</span> (at [44]), the considerations in this class of judgments are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 …[W]here judgment has been entered after a trial in the defendant’s absence, the predominant consideration in deciding whether to set aside the judgment is the reason for the defendant’s absence. In <span class="font-italic">Shocked</span>, Leggatt LJ itemised (at 381) the other relevant factors that the court should take into consideration:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) prejudice – whether the successful party would be prejudiced by the judgment being set aside, especially if the prejudice was irremediable by an order of costs;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) applicant’s delay – whether there was any undue delay by the absent party in applying to set aside the judgment, especially if during the period of delay the successful party acted on the judgment, or third parties acquired rights by reference to it; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) whether complete retrial required – whether the setting aside of a judgment would entail a complete retrial on matters of fact which have already been investigated by the court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) prospects of success – whether the applicant enjoyed a real prospect of success; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) public interest – whether the public interest in finality in litigation would be compromised.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To these broad-ranging factors we would also add the overriding consideration of whether there is a likelihood that a real miscarriage of justice has occurred. This will be discussed in greater detail below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Further, where a party deliberately absents itself and thereby allows a judgment on the merits to be entered against it, the court’s discretion generally weighs heavily in favour of the interest in finality in litigation, despite the weight of the countervailing factors (<span class="font-italic">Su </span><span class="font-italic">Sh-Hsyu</span> at [45]). That is simply because a party who has eschewed one opportunity afforded to it to address the court on the merits of its case will not easily persuade the court to undermine the principle of finality in litigation by affording it another such opportunity.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 To all of these factors, I add only this gloss. <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>, <span class="font-italic">Su </span><span class="font-italic">Sh-Hsyu</span> and <span class="font-italic">First Property</span> were all cases applying an express power conferred by the Rules to set aside a judgment. On this branch of my analysis, I am assuming in the first defendant’s favour, and contrary to my finding, that I have an inherent power to set aside a judgment under O 27 r 3 even though the Rules provide no express power to do so and even though the Rules provide express powers to set aside other types of judgments. That feature of this branch of the analysis, in my view, tilts the balance even further in favour of upholding the interest in finality in litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The touchstone when it comes to exercising the court’s inherent powers is always one of necessity (<span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27]). The starting point is that, even when an inherent power exists, it “should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands” (see <span class="font-italic">Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 353 at [16]–[17]). In my view, therefore, the nature of an inherent power adds significantly on this branch of the analysis to the first defendant’s burden in bringing himself within the framework in [60] of <span class="font-italic">First </span><span class="font-italic">Property</span> and in satisfying each of the factors set out at [44] of<span class="font-italic"> Su </span><span class="font-italic">Sh-Hsyu</span> (see [101] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 All of this means that the starting point in the exercise this hypothetical inherent power is the sufficiency of the first defendant’s reasons for: (a) his absence at the hearing of the plaintiff’s O 27 application; and (b) his failure to apply to set aside the Judgment when he learned of it in March 2020 and, in any event, earlier than August 2021. These are the predominant considerations on the exercise of an inherent power to set aside the Judgment. The first defendant’s counsel accepts this.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Bearing all of this in mind, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the first defendant’s application is an abuse of the process of the court. My findings are as follows. The first defendant was given more than a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the plaintiff’s O 27 application. He learnt of the Judgment very shortly after it was entered. He therefore also had every opportunity to appeal against the Judgment within the stipulated time and even to apply for an extension of time to do so after that deadline expired. I am prepared to infer from the procedural chronology that the first defendant made a deliberate and considered decision to let this action proceed to judgment in Singapore in his absence and to let the Judgment stand without challenging it on appeal in order to take his chances resisting enforcement of that judgment outside Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The result is that the first defendant has failed to discharge the burden that rests on him to persuade a court to exercise an inherent power in his favour and to subvert the interest in finality in litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In order to explain why I am prepared to draw this inference against the first defendant, it is necessary to describe the procedural chronology of this matter in more detail.

For that period of almost two years, therefore, the available evidence established that the second defendant was taking a position on the merits of the plaintiff’s claims which not only contradicted the first defendant’s position but was hostile to his position. The second defendant was accusing the first defendant of perjuring himself in his own affidavit and, at worst, of forging the second defendant’s signature on her affidavit or, at best, of suborning her perjury in the affidavit. All of that obviously raised the issue of whether a single firm of solicitors could continue to represent the Defendants collectively without facing an irreconcilable conflict of interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Eldan applies to discharge itself</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 On 1 July 2019, Eldan applied to discharge itself from acting for the Defendants.

My reasons for that finding are as follow. Dentons continued to keep the first defendant informed of developments in the appeal. Yet, the first defendant took no steps to appoint new counsel or to represent himself to resist the plaintiff’s appeal. He saw no need to do so because, at this point, he had succeeded in having service against him set aside. He knew that the second defendant’s social media post would make it difficult for him to find counsel in Singapore to represent him. He knew that R&amp;T were representing the remaining defendants on the plaintiff’s appeal. He believed that R&amp;T’s submissions for the remaining defendants would suffice to persuade the court to dismiss the plaintiff’s appeals as against all six defendants, including himself.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The registrar’s appeals on jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On 21 August 2019, in anticipation of the hearing of the plaintiff’s registrar’s appeals on jurisdiction and <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> on 26 August 2019 (see [112] above), Dentons took it upon itself to send a letter to the first defendant: (a) reminding him and Mr Ovia that the hearing would take place on 26 August 2019; (b) asking if the first defendant had appointed Singapore solicitors to act for him in the appeal; and (c) to invite the first defendant to exchange written submissions for the appeal.

</div>
</div> It was therefore almost certain that enforcement would have to take place outside Singapore, most likely Papua New Guinea. In that sense, I did not want the Singapore courts to enter a judgment against the Defendants in vain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In addition, although I did not express this third concern to counsel, I was not comfortable granting leave to enter judgment against the Defendants on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application. I thought it more appropriate that any application to enter judgment against the Defendants should proceed <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span>. I was of that view for three reasons. First, the Defendants had entered an appearance and had thereby indicated, at least initially, an intention to defend the plaintiff’s claim in this action. Second, they had filed affidavits in support of their application to set aside service. While the evidence in those affidavits was primarily relevant to jurisdiction and <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> and even though the Defendants had defaulted in filing formal defences to the plaintiff’s claim, I thought that the Defendants should have the opportunity, if they wished, to rely on the evidence in those affidavits to resist judgment being entered against them by default. Third, there was no express provision in O 19 permitting an application for leave to enter judgment under O 19 r 7(1) to be brought <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>. And, because the Defendants had entered an appearance in this action, O 62 r 10 did not operate to release the plaintiff from its obligation to serve the O 19 application on them. I therefore thought that the plaintiff should proceed under O 19 r 7(1) <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I could have addressed all of these concerns simply by directing the plaintiff to file an application for summary judgment under O 14. That would have required the plaintiff to establish on the merits and on the balance of probabilities that there was no issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried and that there was no other reason for a trial within the meaning of O 14 r 3(1). That would also have required the plaintiff to give notice of the application to the Defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 But that procedural option is not now available. Order 14 r 1 as amended now stipulates that the defendant filing a defence is a condition precedent to an application to enter summary judgment. And the Rules gave the court no discretion to dispense with that condition precedent and to allow an application for summary judgment to be brought without the defendant having filed a defence. An application for summary judgment brought in circumstances where any of the stipulated conditions precedent is not fulfilled is therefore liable to be dismissed (see White Book 2022 at 14/1/4).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Given that the option of proceeding to a judgment on the merits under O 14 was no longer available, I considered whether I should direct the plaintiff to proceed to have its claim adjudicated at trial. That was one option for ensuring that the plaintiff’s claim was adjudicated on the merits and with notice to the Defendants. But I rejected this option. I considered the time and costs involved in having the plaintiff’s claim tried were wholly unnecessary and wholly disproportionate given that the Defendants had given no indication either through Dentons or directly to the court following the pre-trial conference on 26 November 2019 that their initial intention to defend, indicated by entering an appearance, continued to be their intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 It appeared to me that the only procedural route available by which to consider the plaintiff’s application to enter judgment against the Defendants with the ability to look beyond the defendant’s procedural default and without incurring unnecessary and disproportionate time and costs was an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> application for judgment on admissions under O 27 r 3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 At my suggestion, therefore, counsel for the plaintiff agreed to make an application under O 27 r 3 praying for judgment to be entered against the Defendants on the deemed admission of facts arising under O 18 r 13 from the Defendants’ failure to file a defence.

PRP wrote to Dentons asking for the applications to be adjourned four weeks to enable the Defendants to file their defences. In response, Dentons asked PRP to clarify whether PRP felt it could act jointly for the Defendants in light of the very serious allegations the second defendant had ostensibly made in the social media post (see [116]–[122] above). The first and second defendants had, from July 2019 until then, maintained a studious silence on the veracity or otherwise of the very serious allegations made against the first defendant in the post. They had never alleged by counsel or on affidavit that the second defendant was not the author of the post or that its contents were false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 When the O 19 and O 27 applications came on for hearing before me on 28 February 2020, Dentons informed me that they could agree only to a short adjournment to allow PRP to take instructions and consider its position on the issue of an actual or potential conflict of interest. I therefore adjourned the applications to 4 March 2020.

Second, a week had elapsed since the first hearing of the O 27 application on 28 February 2020.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 It was only now, in August 2021, that the first defendant applied to set the Judgment aside as against him. That was over 16 months after the first defendant had become aware of the Judgment. I have no hesitation in drawing the inference that he did so, not because he considers that he has any merits in his defence, but only in order to cause delay in the enforcement of the Judgment against him in those jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Impecuniosity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The first defendant submits that the true reason for his failure to engage solicitors to represent him is his impecuniosity. I reject this submission. The burden of establishing impecuniosity rests on the first defendant. He has adduced insufficient evidence of impecuniosity to discharge that burden. In any event, he would have to establish impecuniosity that persisted uninterrupted throughout the period from March 2020 to August 2021. The available evidence suggests that he was not impecunious, at least in March 2020 when he engaged PRP.  It is significant to me that PRP withdrew as the first defendant’s solicitors not because of his impecuniosity but because of a conflict in acting for both the first defendant and the second defendant at the same time. I do not consider it a coincidence that the first defendant was somehow able to find the means to engage Singapore counsel only when the risk of the Judgment actually being enforced against him became a reality and he needed to delay the enforcement proceedings against him outside Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Further, even if the first defendant were impecunious without interruption from March 2020 to August 2021, he could at any time have acted in this action in person. He could have filed a defence simply setting out the factual basis on which he resisted the plaintiff’s claim. That would have sufficed to prevent the deemed admissions on which the plaintiff relied from arising. He could have asked the plaintiff or asked the court by correspondence for an adjournment of the O 27 application, just as he asked the plaintiff’s solicitors for an adjournment of the pre-trial conference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 It is also significant that the period of his delay occurred during the Covid 19 pandemic. Our courts were able throughout these proceedings, and despite the pandemic, to hear from him by video link, even though he was outside the jurisdiction and may have been unable to travel. There was nothing to prevent him from appearing at the O 27 application and seeking an adjournment by video link. Indeed, there was nothing to prevent him appearing at the O 27 application and presenting his case on the merits by video link. Our courts often hear from litigants in person. And if those litigants in person are able to present sufficient facts to the court to make out a claim or a defence, our courts do not punish them for being unschooled in the law. The first defendant took no such steps. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on inherent power</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 From the chronology of events, it is clear to me that the first defendant took a deliberate decision from the time PRP discharged itself that he would ignore this action, allow judgment to be entered against him in this action and ignore the judgment. He did all this because he knew that he had no assets in Singapore. That is quite obviously not a good reason for his absence at the O 27 hearing or for his delay in seeking to set the Judgment aside. This is the predominant consideration in this setting aside application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The defendant had every opportunity to be heard at every critical juncture in this case. His decision not to take advantage of that opportunity was deliberate. His decision to leave the Judgment unchallenged, whether by an appeal or by a setting aside application, for over 16 months was also deliberate. It was only when the plaintiff secured registration of the judgment in Papua New Guinea, New South Wales and Queensland, where the first defendant is either present or has assets, that he belatedly decided to take this action and the Judgment seriously. Even then, he failed to bring an application to extend time for appealing against the Judgment despite indicating that that was his intention. That was the proper procedural course for him to have taken. The public interest in finality in litigation dictates that the proper procedural avenue by which a judgment can be dissolved, subject to any contrary express provision in the Rules, is by a higher court reversing the judgment on appeal and not by the very court which entered the judgment setting it aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 All of this suggests to me that the only reason the first defendant now brings this setting aside application is to delay the enforcement proceedings in those jurisdictions and not because he believes that his defence has any merits. The first defendant has failed to discharge his burden to secure the benefit of the exercise of any inherent power to set aside the judgment. The interest in finality in litigation prevails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170  In the words of Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Vallipuram</span><span class="font-italic"> Gireesa Venkit Eswaran v Scanply International Wood Product (S) Pte Ltd (Kim Yew Trading Co, third party)</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 507:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 It was obvious from the chronology of events, however, that the third party had only decided to make the present application when the defendants had obtained a hearing date for the registration in Malaysia of their judgment. In the absence of any reason for the delay and any other explanation for the timing of the application, I had very serious doubts as to the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of the third party. It appeared to me that it was simply trying to further delay the enforcement of the judgment without any good cause to do so. In these circumstances I saw no reason why I should examine the “merits” of the third party’s case and set aside the judgment if I found such merits to exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Indeed, on my findings, I have no hesitation in characterising the first defendant’s application as an abuse of the process of the court. The application ought to be dismissed even if I were to assume in the first defendant’s favour that he has an arguable defence on the merits to the plaintiff’s claim (see <span class="font-italic">First Property</span> at [105]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Judgment cannot be set aside under O 35 r 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I conclude by rejecting an argument advanced by the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s argument turns on O 35 rr 1(2) and 2. Those rules provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Failure to appear by both parties or one of them (O. 35, r. 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) If, when the trial of an action is called on, one party does not appear, the Judge may proceed with the trial of the action or any counterclaim in the absence of that party, or may without trial give judgment or dismiss the action, or make any other order as he thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judgment, etc., given in absence of party may be set aside (O. 35, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.—(1) Any judgment or order made under Rule 1 may be set aside by the Court on the application of any party on such terms as the Court thinks just. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Unless the Court otherwise orders, an application under this Rule must be made within 14 days after the date of the judgment or order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The plaintiff’s submission proceeds as follows. The Court of Appeal defined “trial” in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Yong Qiang Construction</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 338 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span>”) at [17] to mean “a hearing, whether in open court or in chambers, in which the judge determines the matter in issue before him, whether it be an issue of fact or law”. I entered the Judgment in chambers on 4 March 2020, having determined the issues of fact and law before me on the O 27 application. That hearing was therefore a “trial” at which the first defendant did not appear within the meaning of O 35 r 1(2). The proper course for the first defendant was to have applied to set the Judgment aside under O 35 r 2(1). However, O 35 r 2(2) requires any such application to be made within 14 days of the date of the judgment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> on or before 18 March 2020. The first defendant is therefore well out of time to apply to have the judgment set aside under the applicable provision of the Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission. The hearing on 4 March 2020 was not a trial, it was the hearing of an interlocutory application in chambers. The definition of “trial” which the Court of Appeal adopted in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span> was an extended definition specifically intended to advance the legislative purpose of s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) in circumstances where the ordinary meaning of the word would have had anomalous and incongruous results (at [9], [11] and [13]) which Parliament could not have intended (at [14]). The definition of “trial” which the Court of Appeal adopted in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span> is not the ordinary meaning of that word. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span> (at [2]), the Court of Appeal set out the ordinary meaning of “trial” taken from <span class="font-italic">Jowitt’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Dictionary of English Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 1977) at p 1805:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Trial, the hearing of a cause, civil or criminal, before a judge who has jurisdiction over it, according to the laws of the land. A trial is the finding out by due examination the truth of the point in issue or question between the parties, whereupon judgment may be given (Co Litt 124b).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A trial is that step in an action, prosecution or other judicial proceeding, by which the questions of fact in issue are decided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 This definition captures the essence of a trial. It is an exercise by which the court finds out the facts in issue in a dispute by examination, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> examination in chief and cross-examination of witnesses, as governed by ss 137 to 168 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants was never called on for trial within the meaning of O 35 r 1(2).  I entered the Judgment summarily (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> without a trial) on the Defendants’ admissions of fact under O 27 r 3. Order 35 cannot conceivably apply to the Judgment or to any application to set it aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 In my view, the proper course for the first defendant would have been to apply under O 3 r 4 for an extension of the one-month time limit stipulated in O 56 A r 6 to appeal against the Judgment rather than to apply to set the Judgment aside, whether under O 36 r 2 or any provision or power. I have therefore dismissed his application even though I am prepared to assume in his favour that he has an arguable defence on the merits to the plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179  It may appear that my decision elevates form over substance and penalises the first defendant simply for proceeding under the wrong provision of the Rules in bringing this application. However, for the following reasons, I do not accept that characterisation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 First, an application to extend time to appeal to the Appellate Division <span class="font-italic">after</span> the one month time limit for filing a notice of appeal stipulated by O 56A r 6 has expired can only be made to the Appellate Division under O 3 r 4, and can no longer be made to the General Division under O 56A r 20 (see <span class="font-italic">Lioncity</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Co Pte Ltd v JFC Builders Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 141 at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Mah</span><span class="font-italic"> Kiat Seng v AG</span> [2020] 3 SLR 918 at [44]). The application which the first defendant ought to have made to initiate the process for dissolving the judgment should have been brought in an entirely different court: the Appellate Division. The first defendant’s failure to make that application is not, therefore, an “irregularity” within the meaning of O 2 r 1(1), which I can cure under O 2 r 1(2), even if the conditions precedent for the exercise of that power set out in O 2 r 2(1) were satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Second, even if I had the power to extend time for the first defendant to appeal against the Judgment, as a judge of the General Division, I would not have exercised that power in favour of the first defendant for the very same reasons I have given for finding that the first defendant’s conduct would not warrant the exercise of any inherent power I may have to set aside the Judgment. For the reasons I have given, the procedural chronology of this action shows that the first defendant’s attempt to challenge the Judgment is an abuse of the process of the court and results from his deliberate decision not to defend this action. His application would remain an abuse of the process regardless of the provision of the Rules which the first defendant chose to rest it on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 To put it simply, not only has the first defendant adopted the wrong procedure to dissolve the Judgment, he has also proceeded before the wrong court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 For all these reasons, I have dismissed with costs the first defendant’s application to set aside the Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mark Seah, Alexander Choo and Philip Teh (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nicholas Jeyaraj s/o Narayanan (Nicholas &amp; Tan Partnership LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second defendant, third defendant, fourth defendant, fifth defendant and sixth defendant absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
