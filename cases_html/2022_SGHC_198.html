The accused provided tuition and made those representations in order to gain access to a ready pool of children, including children with learning or physical disabilities.  However, in truth, the accused never possessed a graduate diploma in Psychology.  Moreover, he only obtained a diploma in Learning Disorders Management and Child Psychology on 15 October 2012, a course in which he had enrolled on 29 March 2007.

Indeed, the fact that the accused’s sexual abuse persisted over a period of 16 years was indicative of the fact that the accused was a recalcitrant and habitual offender.  Moreover, as elaborated on below at [41]–[44], the offences were conducted in a highly premeditated manner.  Such premeditation made it apparent that the accused had made a conscious choice to commit the various offences, which necessitated the consideration of specific deterrence in the eventual sentence imposed: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [22]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With these general sentencing considerations in mind, I applied the two-step sentencing framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> (see above at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first step of the Terence Ng framework </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As the offence-specific aggravating factors applicable to the offences committed against V1, V4 and V5 overlap substantially, I will discuss them collectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I found that there were five offence-specific aggravating factors in the present case, which I explain in turn: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the accused abused a position of authority and the trust reposed in him by the victims and their families; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the offences involved a significant degree of premeditation; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the accused raped vulnerable victims who were well below the age of 14; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the accused video recorded his sexual offences; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the accused exposed the victims to the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Abuse of authority and trust </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, the accused grossly abused his position of authority over the victims, and violated the trust reposed in him by the victims and their families.

In the present case, the accused provided tuition to V1, V4 and V5, and also purported to conduct speech therapy lessons for V1.

In response, the accused either warned her to behave and keep quiet or admonished her for not obeying his instructions, before proceeding with his sexual abuse.

The various offences constituted a “campaign of rape” that involved victims with “particularly high degrees of vulnerability”: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [57].  In the circumstances, there was a compelling public interest in meting out a lengthy sentence to protect the public, to specifically deter the accused, and to mark society’s condemnation for the execrable nature of the offences (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [57]).  In particular, I found that all six proceeded charges fell within the middle of Band 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence</span><span class="font-italic"> Ng</span> framework.  Accordingly, under the first step of the <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Ng</span> framework, I found that an indicative starting sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment for each charge was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second step of the Terence Ng framework </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The second step of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework involves calibrating the indicative starting sentence based on the factors which are specific to the offender in question (see above at [24(b)]).

As the advanced age of an offender was a concern for the overall proportionality of punishment (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [65(c)]), I considered the accused’s age in relation to whether the aggregate sentence would offend the totality principle (see [63]–[68] below). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Offences TIC for the purposes of sentencing </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 A court will normally increase a sentence where the TIC offences are of a similar nature: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [64(a)].

The accused here had committed a multitude of sexual offences against multiple victims over a span of 16 years – it would have been unjust to regard him as a first-time offender and accordingly award him a sentencing discount despite his deliberate efforts to avoid detection and escape the law for such a prolonged period of time.  In any event, the absence of relevant antecedents was not a valid mitigating factor, but merely the absence of an additional aggravating factor: <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 4 SLR 580 at [65].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently: <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span> at [41] and [98(b)].  This is subject to s 307(1) of the CPC, which provides that where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the sentences for at least two of those offences must be ordered to run consecutively.  Whether the offences are distinct and unrelated is determined by considering whether they involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest: <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span> at [98(b)].  In the present case, the offences in the 46th Charge, the 52nd Charge and the 57th Charge did not constitute a <span class="font-italic">single</span> invasion of the same legally protected interest and were thus distinct and unrelated – each offence involved different victims and took place on a different date, and therefore did not form part of the same transaction (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [28]–[31]; <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span> at [69]).

The totality principle comprises two limbs: (i) whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved; and (ii) whether the effect of the aggregate sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [54] and [57]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In this inquiry, it is not inconsistent with the totality principle for more than two sentences to run consecutively where the circumstances call for it, for instance: (i) where the court is dealing with persistent or habitual offenders; (ii) where there is a pressing public interest concern in discouraging the type of criminal conduct being punished; (iii) where there are multiple victims; and (iv) where other peculiar cumulative aggravating features are present: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [80] citing <span class="font-italic">ADF</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [146].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the sentences for three of the six proceeded charges ought to run consecutively, with the remaining three sentences to run concurrently.  The present case involved a persistent and habitual offender who had committed numerous sexual offences against multiple victims over a prolonged period of 16 years.  There was also a pressing public interest in deterring the sexual offences committed here, especially those committed by paedophiles against young and vulnerable children.  I noted that running three sentences consecutively in the present case was consistent with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span>.  In that case, the offender was convicted of four charges (including three charges of rape under s 375(2) of the 2008 PC).  Out of the 29 charges that were TIC for the purposes of sentencing, 18 were sexual in nature.  Like the present case, a psychiatrist had concluded that the offender in <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span> posed a risk of serious sexual harm to the public (see <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span> at [126]).  The court decided at [131] that based on the overall criminality of the offender’s conduct, three of the four sentences (of 12 years and six months of imprisonment each) should run consecutively, which was upheld on appeal.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Running three sentences consecutively would have resulted in an aggregate sentence of 57 years’ imprisonment, based on a sentence of 19 years’ imprisonment per proceeded charge.  I agreed with the Prosecution that an aggregate sentence of 57 years’ imprisonment was excessive.  Even if the accused was granted remission for good behaviour and his sentence was backdated to his date of remand of 11 June 2018, he would only be released when he is around 88 years old.  That would be a crushing sentence.  While the advanced age of an offender is not generally a factor that warrants a sentencing discount, the imposition of a substantial custodial term which deprives an offender of a larger fraction of their expectation of life so as to effectively amount to a life sentence might offend the totality principle: <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v UI</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [78] cited in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [65(c)].  Nevertheless, I was mindful that any leniency afforded by reason of the accused’s advanced age must be balanced against the need to ensure that he would still be adequately punished, in line with the gravity of his offences (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [65(c)]).  Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">ABJ</span>, the Court of Appeal recognised that, while the age of an offender may be a mitigating factor, the advanced age of the offender in that case “pale[d] into insignificance in the light of what was perpetrated by the [offender] on the victim” (at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In light of the fact that the accused was 54 years old at the time of sentencing, I found that the individual sentence for each charge should be calibrated downwards to 15 years’ imprisonment, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 45 years’ imprisonment.  I found such a sentence to be proportionate to the overall criminality of the accused’s offending, without violating the totality principle.  The accused would be released when he is around 80 years old if he successfully obtains remission for good behaviour and his sentence was backdated to the date of his remand.  That would not be effectively imposing a life sentence on him.  I was fortified in my conclusion by the decision in <span class="font-italic">ABJ</span>, which involved a 60-year-old offender who had pleaded guilty to nine charges of sexual assault (including five charges under s 376(2) of the 1985 PC and two charges under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) respectively of the 2008 PC), with 35 charges TIC for the purposes of sentencing.  There, the Court of Appeal increased the sentence meted out by the trial judge from 24 years’ imprisonment to 32 years’ imprisonment (at [21]), which meant that the offender in <span class="font-italic">ABJ</span> would only be released when he is around 79 to 80 years old (assuming he obtains remission for good behaviour). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Notably, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Kooi</span> [2019] SGHC 166, the High Court sentenced the offender (who was 65 years old) to 310 months’ imprisonment (25.8 years’ imprisonment) for offences under s 409 of the 1985 PC, after expressly taking into account his advanced age and the principle that the court should not impose what would effectively be a life sentence (at [39] and [40]).  This was affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ewe Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Kooi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 1 SLR 757, where the Court of Appeal noted that there are limits to the principle that a sentencing court should be mindful of the real effect of a sentence on an offender of advanced age, and that the sentence in that case was simply a consequence of the period of time during which the offender had managed to keep his criminal activities concealed (at [10]).  Here, the accused had similarly evaded apprehension despite committing sexual offences over a lengthy period of 16 years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Moreover, I found that an aggregate sentence of 45 years’ imprisonment was not out of step with sentencing precedents involving similar factual matrixes: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span>, which was similarly classified as a Band 3 case in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [58(a)], the court had sentenced the offender to an aggregate sentence of 37 years’ and six months’ imprisonment for three counts of rape under s 375(2) and one count of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376(3) of the 2008 PC (which was upheld by the Court of Appeal).

</div>  The court considered, among other things, that: (i) the offender had video recorded his sexual offences; (ii) the offences were premeditated; and (iii) the offender had used drugs to overcome his victims’ resistance and erase their memory of the offences (at [110]–[112]).  Notably, the court had calibrated the initial sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment per charge downwards to 12 years’ and six months’ imprisonment in view of the offender’s age (at [132] and [133]), meaning that the sentence would ordinarily have been harsher but for the offender’s age.  Even though the accused here had not used drugs in the commission of his offences unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span>, the overall criminality of the accused was higher.  While the offender in <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had 29 charges TIC for the purposes of sentencing, the accused here had 80.  Moreover, the offences in the proceeded charges in the present case (namely, aggravated rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with of s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the 2008 PC and s 376(2) of the 1985 PC) were of a more serious nature than those in <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span>, as reflected by the higher range of sentences statutorily prescribed for the former. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span>, the offender was convicted of four counts of carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377, one count of attempted carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 read with s 511, and five counts of committing acts of gross indecency under s 377A of the 1985 PC.  The High Court imposed a global sentence of 40 years’ imprisonment (which was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal).  The offender in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span>, a diagnosed paedophile, had sexually abused five male victims who were between eight and 12 years old at the material time.  In this case, the accused had abused eight victims, some of whom were much younger at five years old.  Several of the victims, such as V1 and V4, were also especially vulnerable because of their learning difficulties.  Further, the accused’s period of offending spanned across 16 years, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span> where the period of offending was slightly over a year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The criminality of the accused’s conduct exceeded those of the offenders in <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span> and <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span> due to the more serious nature of the offences committed, the longer period of sexual abuse as well as the number, youth and vulnerability of the victims involved in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the above reasons, I sentenced the accused to 15 years’ imprisonment for each of the six proceeded charges.  I ordered the sentences for the 46th Charge, the 52nd Charge and the 57th Charge to run consecutively, with the sentences for the remaining charges to run concurrently.  The accused was thus sentenced to an aggregate of 45 years’ imprisonment.  I backdated the accused’s sentence to commence from his date of remand, 11 June 2018, which the Prosecution had no objection to.

First, a strong message needed to be sent to deter potential like-minded offenders from committing similar offences.  Second, the accused’s deplorable conduct had to be denounced in the strongest possible terms to reflect society’s condemnation for his depraved acts against children who had trusted him as a tutor and in some cases, a father figure.  Third, the accused, a clinically diagnosed paedophile at high risk of continued sexual offending, had to be taken out of public circulation for an appropriately long time to protect the public from a serial child rapist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I note that the lengthy period of imprisonment imposed was higher than those imposed in the majority of reported cases concerning rape offences.  However, the campaign of rape committed by the accused called for an unusually long sentence that was commensurate with the accused’s abominable conduct.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock <br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andre Ong and Yvonne Poon (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Fong Mun Yung Gregory John (Fong &amp; Fong LLC) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
