Since these examples referred to the Cabinet, the following phrase “corruption at the highest echelons” would also be understood by the ordinary reasonable person to be an imputation concerning members of the Cabinet.

</div> In respect of the first appellant’s argument that the criminal defamation provisions violated Art 14 of the Constitution, the Judge noted that “law” as defined in Art 2 of the Constitution clearly included pre-independence laws such as the Penal Code.

</div> Hence, the criminal defamation provisions did not fall outside of the category of permissible restrictions to Art 14 rights under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The Judge also rejected the argument that proportionality analysis should be used to review the constitutionality of pre-independence laws, noting that our courts had consistently rejected the notion of proportionality as part of Singapore law.

This is in line with Explanation 2 to s 499 of the Penal Code:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation </span>2.<span class="font-italic">—</span>It may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company, or an association or a collection of persons as such<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Thus, there are three elements to the offence of criminal defamation under s 499 of the Penal Code:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Making or publishing an imputation concerning any person, which includes a company or an association or collection of persons as such;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Making such imputation by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or by visible representations; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Making such imputation with the intention of harming or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of that person.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 There are several exceptions to the offence under s 499. The Second Exception, which protects opinions made in good faith respecting the public conduct of public servants, is pertinent in this case as the second appellant relies on it. This exception will be discussed in greater detail at a later section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 There are several differences between the offence of criminal defamation under s 499 of the Penal Code and civil defamation. First, whilst the burden of proof in civil suits is on the balance of probabilities, the burden of proof with respect to criminal proceedings is beyond reasonable doubt. Second, the consequences of making out an offence of criminal defamation are more serious than that for civil defamation. Damages are typically granted for successful civil defamation suits, whereas under s 500 of the Penal Code a person found guilty of criminal defamation may be punished with imprisonment for a term of up to two years, or with a fine, or with both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Third, there is a key difference between who the subject of defamation may be in civil defamation as compared to criminal defamation. For civil defamation, where the offending words refer to a class or body of persons as opposed to a specific individual, a successful claim may still be made out if the ordinary reasonable person can conclude that the statement is capable of being interpreted as referring to the individual: <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) at [53].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 However, for criminal defamation, there is no such requirement that the relevant statement be capable of being interpreted as referring to an individual. Both s 11 of the Penal Code and Explanation 2 to s 499 establish that criminal defamation is not limited to imputations concerning individuals and may still be made out where the relevant imputation concerns a company or an association or collection of persons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The following issues arise for consideration with respect to the criminal defamation charges:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, whether the charges were defective for lack of particulars as to the precise identities of the allegedly defamed persons;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, whether, and if so in what way, the Disputed Phrase referred to members of the Cabinet;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Third, whether the appellants knew that the Disputed Phrase would harm the reputation of the members of the Cabinet; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Fourth, whether the appellants may avail themselves of the Second Exception under s 499 of the Penal Code; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Fifth, whether the criminal defamation provisions are unconstitutional.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the criminal defamation charges were defective for lack of particulars</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The second appellant submits that the criminal defamation charge against him was defective because it lacked material particulars as to the exact identity of the persons allegedly targeted by the Disputed Phrase. Essentially, the second appellant argues that since the membership of the Cabinet changes from time to time, it is incumbent on the Prosecution to frame the charge as including the precise names of the members of the Cabinet who were allegedly defamed.

It reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Details of time, place and person or thing</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">124.</span>—(1) The charge must contain details of the time and place of the alleged offence and the person (if any) against whom or the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed, <span class="font-italic">as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of what the accused is charged with</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As observed earlier at [23], the effect of s 11 of the Penal Code and Explanation 2 to s 499 of the Penal Code is that the victims of an offence under s 499 – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the allegedly defamed persons – need not be individual persons and may be an association, collection, or body of persons. Thus, contrary to the second appellant’s contention, it is not incumbent on the Prosecution to frame the charge as including the precise names of the members of the Cabinet who were allegedly defamed. The term “members of the Cabinet” refers to a sufficiently specific collection or body of persons and comes within Explanation 2 to s 499 as well as the definition of a “person” under s 11. Hence, in the context of s 499, framing the alleged victims of the criminal defamation charge as “members of the Cabinet” is “reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of what the accused is charged with”, as is required under s 124(1) of the CPC.

Since the members of the Cabinet are responsible for all policies and the day-to-day administration of affairs of the State, allegations of “policy or foreign screw-ups” or “tampering of the Constitution” would naturally be construed as being levelled at the members of the Cabinet. Accordingly, the following illustration of there being “corruption at the highest echelons” would also be understood by an ordinary reasonable person as being levelled at the members of the Cabinet.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The decision</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As a preliminary point, the Prosecution’s reliance on the 30 July 2018 Article to shed light on the meaning of the phrase “present PAP leadership” in the Paragraph is misplaced. When assessing the meaning of the allegedly defamatory words, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible, and the meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and the context of the passage in which they are set out: <span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corp </span>at [53]. The 30 July 2018 Article constitutes such inadmissible extrinsic evidence and cannot be used in the interpretive exercise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Paragraph requires interpretation as to:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, whether the “present PAP leadership” would be read by the ordinary, reasonable person as referring to members of the Cabinet; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, the relationship between the “present PAP leadership” and “corruption at the highest echelons”.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As regards the first point, the ordinary, reasonable person would indeed read the “present PAP leadership” in the first sentence of the Paragraph as referring to members of the Cabinet. Read alone, the phrase “present PAP leadership” may refer to different bodies of persons other than the members of the Cabinet – for example, members of the PAP CEC. However, read in the context of the paragraph, the phrase “present PAP leadership” would naturally be equated by the ordinary, reasonable person with the present PAP Government’s leadership, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, members of the Cabinet. The key to this interpretation is the reference, in the second sentence of the Paragraph, to “multiple policy and foreign screw-ups” and “tampering of the Constitution”. These are matters of State which would reasonably be read as being primarily within the purview of the main decision-making body of the Executive – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Cabinet – as opposed to that of bodies such as the PAP CEC, which is an internal party structure. The second appellant argues that constitutional amendments are approved not by the members of the Cabinet, but rather by the votes of two-thirds of Parliament.

</div> However, an ordinary, reasonable person would not be focused on the strict legal requirements for passing constitutional amendments, but rather on the body of persons which, in practice, makes the decision to pursue these amendments; that is, the Cabinet. Indeed, the ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines, as opposed to being confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words: <span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corp </span>at [53].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 This analysis informs the assessment of the ordinary, reasonable person’s reading of the phrase “present PAP leadership” in the first sentence. Since the illustrations of the perceived failures of the “present PAP leadership” in the second sentence are matters which are primarily within the purview of members of the Cabinet, the reasonable inference is that the “present PAP leadership” is a reference to the body of persons responsible for those perceived failures – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the members of the Cabinet. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that in the Singaporean context, the ordinary, reasonable person would be cognisant that members of the Cabinet would invariably be key members of the PAP, and thus would be apt to associate the “present PAP leadership” with the members of the Cabinet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As for the relationship between the “present PAP leadership” and “corruption at the highest echelons”, it is difficult to accept the Prosecution’s position that the Disputed Phrase “corruption at the highest echelons” would be interpreted by the ordinary, reasonable person as an allegation levelled at members of the Cabinet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Though I accept the Prosecution’s argument that the second sentence of the Paragraph gave illustrations of perceived failures which occurred under the purview of the members of the Cabinet, such as “multiple policy and foreign screw-ups” and “tampering of the Constitution”,

</div> it does not follow that “corruption at the highest echelons” means, as the Prosecution argues, that the members of the Cabinet were themselves corrupt. Indeed, the more natural interpretation, as argued for by the first appellant, is that alongside the other failures, corruption occurring at the highest levels was another instance of a failure of action or omission by the Cabinet.

</div> In other words, there is a crucial distinction between saying that members of the Cabinet were in some way responsible for the rise of “corruption at the highest echelons” under their watch and saying that the Cabinet members were corrupt.

The Paragraph clearly characterises the various alleged failures described in the second sentence, including “corruption at the highest echelons”, as events which had occurred as a result of the leadership failures referred to in the first sentence, specifically a severe lack of innovation, vision and drive. Whether “the highest echelons” referred to the establishment, the “great and good”, or some other segment is not entirely clear, but what matters is that there was an imputation within the Paragraph that members of the Cabinet were responsible, because of their incompetence or failures, for the emergence of serious and substantial corruption in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the appellants knew that the Disputed Phrase would harm the reputation of the members of the Cabinet</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Under s 499 of the Penal Code, the applicable <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> to be shown is that the accused published the relevant imputation concerning a person “intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Explanation 4 of s 499 elaborates on how an imputation may be said to harm a person’s reputation.

</div> Next, the first appellant advances three related arguments to show that no harm was occasioned to the reputation of members of the Cabinet, and hence that he would not have known that such harm would result. The arguments are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there was nothing to show that the reputation of individual members of the Cabinet was harmed. There was no complaint made and no civil suit started by the allegedly defamed members of the Cabinet.

The imputation contained in the Disputed Phrase satisfies this threshold for finding harm to a person’s reputation. The word “corruption” is defined in the <span class="font-italic">Oxford Advanced </span><span class="font-italic">Learner’s Dictionary</span> (Diana Lea and Jennifer Bradbery ed) (Oxford University Press, 10th ed, 2023) as “dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority”.

</div>
</div> The word “echelon” is defined in <span class="font-italic">The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</span> (Lesley Brown ed) (Oxford University Press, 1993) as “a particular level in any organization”. Thus, the imputation is that as a result of the incompetence of members of the Cabinet, dishonest or illegal behaviour had been allowed to emerge amongst people in authority in certain high-ranking segments of Singaporean society. This allegation is one which strikes at the question of the Cabinet members’ competence to run the country. It clearly lowers the character of members of the Cabinet in respect of their position as political leaders and certainly lowers their credit in general. Thus, the appellants, knowing that this was the nature of the imputation, did in fact make the imputation with the knowledge that it would harm the reputation of members of the Cabinet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Taking next the three related arguments which the first appellant advances to show that he had no knowledge that the imputation would harm the reputation of members of the Cabinet, none of these are made out. First, he argues that there was no evidence that the reputation of individual members of the Cabinet was harmed, since no complaint was made nor was any civil suit started by the defamed members, none of them were called by the Prosecution to testify as to the harm they suffered, and the Judge did not specify the harm caused by the imputation.

</div> This argument cannot stand. Section 499 of the Penal Code does not require actual harm to the person’s reputation to be shown. Rather, the provision stipulates intention or knowledge on the accused’s part that the imputation would harm the allegedly defamed person’s reputation. It may be that in most cases, actual harm to the person’s reputation would result, but the provision does not require such evidence of actual harm to be shown. In any case, it is not necessary that there be a complaint, civil suit, or testimony from the defamed persons before harm results from the imputation. Explanation 4 of s 499 provides the threshold for such a finding, namely that the imputation would lower the credit of the allegedly defamed persons or their character in respect of their calling. This threshold has been crossed here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Next, the first appellant argues that the Prosecution vacillated on its position on whether it was the Cabinet as an entity or individual members of the Cabinet who were defamed as it was afraid of contravening the <span class="font-italic">Derbyshire </span>principle that a government body cannot sue for defamation.

</div>
</div> This argument does not touch the analysis under s 499 of the Penal Code. As elaborated earlier at [23], the effect of s 11 of the Penal Code and Explanation 2 to s 499 is that the offence of criminal defamation under s 499 allows for the allegedly defamed “person” to be an association, collection, or body of persons. Thus, the line which the first appellant seeks to draw between the Cabinet as an entity and the members of the Cabinet is not relevant. The crucial point is that the term “members of the Cabinet” refers to a sufficiently specific collection or body of persons, which falls within the acceptable limits of s 499 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As for <span class="font-italic">Derbyshire</span>, the proposition advanced in that case was that a government body cannot sue for defamation in the civil context. Lord Keith held at 459 that “under the common law of England a local authority does not have the right to <span class="font-italic">maintain an action of damages for defamation</span>” [emphasis added]. There is no relevance between this principle, which relates to a government body suing for civil defamation, and the present case, which involves criminal proceedings instituted by the AG, not the allegedly defamed persons, concerning criminal defamation under s 499 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Lastly, the first appellant submits that the word “corruption” in the Disputed Phrase could refer to moral corruption, as opposed to there being illegal, fraudulent, or dishonest conduct by members of the Cabinet.

</div> This argument has reduced relevance given the finding that the imputation is that members of the Cabinet were responsible for the emergence of “corruption”, as opposed to being corrupt themselves. In any case, based on the political context of the Paragraph and its focus on alleged grave governmental failures, it is difficult to accept that “corruption” would have referred to some more minor form of moral impropriety as opposed to <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> corruption in the form of illegal, fraudulent, or dishonest behaviour by those in power.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the appellants may avail themselves of the Second Exception under s 499 of the Penal Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The second appellant relies on the Second Exception to s 499 of the Penal Code.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 There are two issues to be clarified here:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, what constitutes an “opinion” under the Second Exception as opposed to a statement of fact; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, what constitutes good faith under s 499 of the Penal Code.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As regards the first issue, guidance may be taken from case law relating to the defence of fair comment in civil defamation. Although this defence relates to civil defamation, there is no reason – and indeed the appellants do not contend otherwise – why the principles from this body of case law relating to statements of fact versus opinion should not be applicable to s 499 of the Penal Code as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Under the defence of fair comment, a statement of opinion is one which comes with clear indications, from the context in which it appears, that it is the author’s own view or interpretation of matters rather than a statement of fact: <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing (CA) </span>at [146]–[147]. A statement of opinion must not be intermingled with a statement of fact such that the reader cannot distinguish between what is opinion and what is fact: <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing (CA) </span>at [147]. The identification of a statement of opinion or fact is a question of fact for the court’s determination and is dependent upon the nature of the imputation conveyed, and the context and circumstances in which it is published: <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing (CA) </span>at [144].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Applying these principles, the imputation made by the appellants is clearly a statement of fact. The first and second sentences of the Paragraph read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The present PAP leadership severely lacks innovation, vision and the drive to take us into the next lap. We have seen multiple policy and foreign screw-ups, tampering of the Constitution, corruption at the highest echelons and apparent lack of respect from foreign powers ever since the demise of founding father Lee Kuan Yew. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There is no clear indication, from the context of these sentences, that the allegation of “corruption at the highest echelons” was the author’s own view or interpretation rather than a statement of fact. Instead, the author appears to be making a definitive statement of fact that there have been “multiple policy and foreign screw-ups, tampering of the Constitution, corruption at the highest echelons and apparent lack of respect from foreign powers” under the “present PAP leadership” ever since the demise of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Hence, the imputation here – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that “corruption at the highest echelons” occurred under the watch of members of the Cabinet due to their incompetence – was a statement of fact rather than a statement of opinion. The appellants therefore cannot rely on the Second Exception under s 499 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Given this finding, it is not strictly necessary to address the second issue pertaining to good faith under s 499. Nevertheless, I note that it is doubtful whether the second appellant acted in good faith. Contrary to what the second appellant argues, I have found (at [54]–[57]) that he knew the phrase “present PAP leadership” would be construed as a reference to members of the Cabinet and “corruption at the highest echelons” would be construed as something which had occurred on the watch of members of the Cabinet due to their incompetence. Thus, the second appellant’s argument that he had no duty to make any effort to ascertain the truth of his allegations cannot stand.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The difficulty with this argument is that Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does not require that Parliament must have introduced, debated, and enacted such laws. Pre-independence laws which have been retained by Parliament may also be said to be “imposed” by Parliament, since their continued operation takes place only with Parliament’s approval. Indeed, Parliament is not excluded from assessing and considering laws which were enacted before independence. The text of Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does not stipulate that Parliament cannot consider such laws to be “necessary or expedient” for the purposes enumerated under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Thus, the analysis for the constitutionality of pre-independence laws under Art 14 is no different from that for post-independence laws – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, via the framework under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The criminal defamation provisions, despite being pre-independence laws, do satisfy the requirements of Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). They have been continuously retained by Parliament as part of the body of Singapore criminal law throughout the numerous reviews and amendments of the Penal Code conducted since independence. Indeed, Parliament constantly reviews and updates the provisions within the Penal Code. Some provisions are amended, whilst new provisions are introduced and provisions which are no longer necessary are repealed. Thus, in the Second Reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2007, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee emphasised the detailed review of the Penal Code which had been conducted then (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Reports </span>(22 Oct 2007), vol 83 at col 2175):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We carefully considered every feedback received, holding discussions with the relevant agencies to explore the ideas, suggestions and views that surfaced … In all, this review will see 77 provisions expanded, updated or clarified, four provisions repealed, and 21 new offences enacted to address identified gaps in the law … we have undertaken <span class="font-italic">a comprehensive and holistic review of all the penalties set out in the Code</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The continuous retention of the criminal defamation provisions as part of the body of Singapore law indicates that they are “imposed” by Parliament since their continued operation takes place only with Parliament’s approval. Since the provisions are retained specifically as part of the Penal Code, this also indicates that they are considered by Parliament to be “necessary or expedient” for the interests of public order under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). For the purposes of evaluating whether a law was considered by Parliament to be “necessary or expedient”, it is not necessary for Parliament to have expressly referred to the restriction of the relevant constitutional right; rather, the court may infer from the general purposes for which Parliament approved the relevant legislation that it had considered it “necessary or expedient” to restrict the constitutional right in question: <span class="font-italic">Wham K</span><span class="font-italic">wok Han Jolovan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]. I am satisfied that the clear inference from the continuous retention of the criminal defamation provisions as part of the Penal Code is that Parliament does consider the criminal defamation provisions to be “necessary or expedient” in the interests of public order as is required under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 However, the simple fact of a law’s existence and approval by Parliament would not be sufficient to find that Parliament considered it to be “necessary or expedient”. The court must determine, under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), whether Parliament considered a law to be “necessary or expedient” <span class="font-italic">for one of the enumerated purposes</span> in the provision. The mere existence or approval by Parliament of a law would be insufficient to show that it considered there to be a link between the law and one of the enumerated purposes. Nevertheless, with respect to the criminal defamation provisions, it is hard to see how Parliament could not have considered there to be a link between the provisions and providing against public order. This purpose is inherent within the Penal Code and the criminal defamation provisions themselves, such that it is unnecessary for there to be any explicit recognition of the link before it can be said that Parliament considered the link to exist. The retention of the criminal defamation provisions within the Penal Code since independence is therefore sufficient to find an implicit recognition on Parliament’s part that the criminal defamation provisions were “necessary or expedient” in the interests of public order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Furthermore, under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the phrase “necessary or expedient” does not appear to apply to restrictions which “provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence”. Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) states that “Parliament may by law impose … such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient [in the interests of the various purposes] … <span class="font-italic">and</span> restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to any offence” [emphasis added]. Hence, the phrase “necessary or expedient” does not seem to apply to the second group of restrictions, which includes laws providing against defamation. It is therefore doubtful whether the phrase “necessary or expedient” under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) even applies to the criminal defamation provisions. Nevertheless, this analysis is of little consequence to the present case, given the finding that the criminal defamation provisions were in any case considered by Parliament to be “necessary or expedient” in the interests of public order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Proportionality analysis does not apply in Singapore constitutional law</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Proportionality analysis</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The first appellant argues that since Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) should not apply to pre-independence laws such as the criminal defamation provisions, proportionality analysis should be applied instead to determine if the provisions are constitutionally valid.

</div>
</div> Given the finding at [75] that Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is in fact applicable to pre-independence laws, it is not strictly necessary, on the first appellant’s case, to consider his submissions relating to proportionality analysis. However, since it could be argued that proportionality analysis should apply in spite of Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), this issue will be examined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The doctrine of proportionality analysis is a specific legal test used for determining whether governmental acts or laws are justified under limitation clauses in constitutional provisions. It has been described as comprising four components (see Aharon Barak, <span class="font-italic">The nature and function of proportionality</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and their Limitations</span> (Cambridge University Press, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and their Limitations</span>”) at p 131 and Alec Stone Sweet and Jud Mathews, <span class="font-italic">Proportionality and Constitutional Governance</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Proportionality Balancing and Constitutional Governance: A Comparative and Global Approach</span> (Oxford University Press, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Proportionality Balancing and Constitutional Governance</span>”) at p 35):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the “proper purpose” test, which requires that the proposed limitation of a constitutional right serves a constitutionally authorised purpose.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the “rational connection” test, which requires a rational nexus to exist between the proposed limitation and the purpose pursued.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the “necessity” test, which requires that the limitation does not impair the constitutional right more than necessary for the achievement of the purpose pursued.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the “balancing” test (also known as “proportionality in the strict sense”), which requires the court to balance the benefits gained by fulfilling the pursued purpose against the impairment caused to the constitutional right. This balance must be determined by the court to be proportionate – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the benefits gained by the proposed limitation must justify the impairment to the right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If a proposed limitation fails any of these four sub-tests, it will be constitutionally invalid under proportionality analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Lack of applicability to Singapore constitutional law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Proportionality analysis has been adopted, to varying degrees, in several jurisdictions around the world (see Vicki Jackson, “<span class="font-italic">Constitutional Law in an Age of Proportionality</span>” (2014) 124(8) Yale Law Journal 3094 at 3094). The doctrine is perhaps most prominently applied in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. It has also been applied in jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Canada (see Professors Stone Sweet and Mathews, <span class="font-italic">Proportionality Balancing and Constitutional Governance </span>at pp 70–72).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 However, the adoption of proportionality analysis in other jurisdictions does not determine its applicability in Singapore. The established position in Singapore is that proportionality analysis has never been part of our constitutional law: <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 (“<span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin</span>”) at [87].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Proportionality analysis contradicts the separation of powers</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Besides the forgoing difficulty, adoption of proportionality analysis would contradict the principle of separation of powers, which is well-established in Singapore constitutional law: <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span> at [27]. The separation of powers is inherent in our Constitution: Art 38 of the Constitution vests the legislative power of Singapore in the Legislature (comprising the President and Parliament); Art 23(1) vests the executive power in the President (and exercisable by the Cabinet or any Minister authorised by the Cabinet); and Art 93 vests the judicial power in the courts. Essentially, the Legislature is charged with making laws, the Executive with governing the country according to those laws, and the Judiciary with the responsibility for adjudicating individual cases by pronouncing on the meaning of the laws: <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng v Attorney-General and another matter</span> [2016] 1 SLR 779 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng</span>”) at [90]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Although the relationship between the different branches of Government is admittedly a complex one (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng</span> at [91]), it has been a consistent position in Singapore law that courts cannot create or amend laws in a manner which permits recourse to extra-legal policy factors and considerations: <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter</span> [2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span>”) at [77]. The Judiciary is not well-equipped to handle extra-legal issues involving national security, policy, or other polycentric political considerations: <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng</span> at [93]. Rather, the courts and judges specialise in interpreting and applying the law in order to uphold justice in the specific cases which come before them. Furthermore, as unelected officials, judges lack the democratic mandate to pronounce upon matters requiring the determination and assessment of moral, political, social, and cultural mores: <span class="font-italic">UKM v Attorney-General</span> [2019] 3 SLR 874 at [128]. Thus, the evaluation of the substantive merits of laws <span class="font-italic">–</span> <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the assessment of the moral, political, social, and cultural desirability of certain laws – should be left to the Legislature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Deference to the Legislature in the evaluation of the substantive merits of laws is evident in Singapore case law: see <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1981] 1 AC 648 at 673–674; <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2010] 3 SLR 489 at [49]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span> at [82]. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>concerning the former s 377A of the Penal Code, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA explained the importance of courts refraining from assuming the legislative function of reviewing the extra-legal merits of legislation. He observed that it would be a violation of the separation of powers for courts to engage in the determination of extra-legal considerations and matters of social policy (at [189]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… many of the arguments tendered to this court, whilst valid (or, at least, plausible) in their own right, <span class="font-italic">involved extra-legal considerations and matters of social policy which were outside the remit of the court</span>, and should, instead, have been canvassed in the legislative sphere … <span class="font-italic">the court can only consider legal (as opposed to extra-legal) arguments</span>. This ensures that it will not become a “mini-legislature”. The court <span class="font-italic">cannot – and must not – assume legislative functions which are necessarily beyond its remit</span>. To do so would be to efface the very separation of powers which confers upon the court its legitimacy in the first place. <span class="font-italic">If the court were to assume legislative functions, it would no longer be able to sit to assess the legality of statutes from an objective perspective</span>. Worse still, it would <span class="font-italic">necessarily be involved in expressing views on extra-legal issues which would – in the nature of things – be (or at least be perceived to be) subjective in nature</span>. This would further erode the legitimacy of the court, which ought only to sit to administer the law in an objective manner. [emphases added; emphases in original omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Thus, respect for the separation of powers generally precludes courts from engaging in reviews of the substantive merits of legislative acts, which would necessarily entail courts engaging in the determination of matters involving extra-legal polycentric considerations of policy, politics, and ethics:  matters which are rightfully the province of the Legislature rather than the Judiciary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The scrutiny befitting the courts’ role is defined by the enumerated rights and other provisions of the Constitution. Adopting a proportionality doctrine rewrites the Constitution, arrogating to the courts a limitation on the breadth of action of the Legislature that is not contemplated by the text of the Constitution. If the courts were to do so, they would be grafting a concept alien to the text. The true life of the text lies in its proper interpretation, not in the improper infusion of the subjective wishes of unelected officials, lawyers, or academics. If the constitutional framework is to be changed, there are proper mechanisms to be used; the courts cannot be invoked for that.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The applicable approach under Art 14</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The applicable approach under Art 14 to determine the validity of a restriction on the right to freedom of speech and expression was set out in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span> and stems solely from the text of Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The three-step framework in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]–[32] (and as applied in <span class="font-italic">The Online Citizen </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters </span>[2021] 2 SLR 1358 at [55]) is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court must assess whether the legislation restricts the constitutional right under Art 14 in the first place;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the legislation restricts the constitutional right, the court must determine whether Parliament considered the restriction to be “necessary or expedient” in the interests of one of the enumerated purposes under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). In making that assessment, the court may have regard to the relevant legislation, parliamentary material, contemporary speeches as well as documents to determine whether Parliament had considered it “necessary or expedient” to restrict the constitutional right in question, or more generally to assess the purposes for which Parliament passed the relevant legislation. It is not necessary for Parliament to have expressly referred to the restriction of the relevant constitutional right: the court may infer from the general purposes for which Parliament passed the relevant legislation that it had considered it “necessary or expedient” to restrict the constitutional right in question.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court must analyse whether, objectively, the restriction of the constitutional right falls within any of the enumerated purposes under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). This must be established by showing a nexus between the purpose of the restriction and one of the enumerated purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham </span>further elaborated at [33] that “[i]n the final analysis, it is imperative to appreciate that a balance must be found between the competing interests at stake”. The first appellant argues that the requirement of a “balance” here resembles the balancing exercise undertaken in proportionality analysis.

</div>
</div> However, the “balance” referred to in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span> appears to be quite different from the balancing exercise in proportionality analysis. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span>, in holding that “a balance must be found between the competing interests at stake”, followed that statement by noting that “the idea of achieving a balance between a constitutional right and a constitutionally permitted derogation <span class="font-italic">is not novel to our law</span>” [emphasis added]. It went on to cite the cases of <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin </span>at [2] and <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120] as support for the presence of this idea in Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin</span> is the very same case in which V K Rajah J held at [87] that the notion of proportionality had never been part of the common law or Singapore law on judicial review. Thus, the “balance” referred to by Rajah J at [2] is not the balancing conducted under proportionality analysis. Rather, the “balance” referred to in <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin</span> is one required by Art 14 itself such that a proposed restriction on the right can be said to be “necessary or expedient”. This interpretation is supported by the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>at [120] (also cited in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the question is “whether the balance between the right to free speech and the protection of public order has been struck in a “necessary or expedient” manner”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The criminal defamation provisions are constitutionally valid under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Applying the <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham </span>framework, the criminal defamation provisions are constitutionally valid under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). First, the criminal defamation provisions do restrict the right to freedom of speech and expression under Art 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Second, Parliament did consider the criminal defamation provisions to be “necessary or expedient” in the interests of public order. As was observed at [76], the Penal Code has been considered, reviewed, and amended from independence till the present-day. The criminal defamation provisions have been continuously retained throughout these reviews and amendments. Thus, Parliament did consider the criminal defamation provisions to be “necessary or expedient” in the interests of public order. Third, there is a clear nexus between the criminal defamation provisions and public order, which is one of the enumerated purposes under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).

This difference in reasoning did not call for the amendment of the charges or the calling of new defences; it was only in relation as to how the elements were made out on the facts found by the court. The charges against the two appellants did not have to and did not actually go into how the defamatory effect was made out. Taking the charge against the first appellant as an example, it read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You … are charged that you, on or about 4 September 2018, in Singapore, had defamed members of the Cabinet of Singapore by publishing an imputation concerning members of the Cabinet of Singapore by words intended to be read, to wit, by approving the publication on the website www.theonlinecitizen.com of a letter from ‘Willy Sum’ titled “<span class="font-italic">The Take Away From Seah Kian Ping’s Facebook Post</span>” which stated that there was “corruption at the highest echelons”, knowing that such imputation would harm the reputation of members of the Cabinet of Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 500 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The charges against the two appellants can stand unaltered even on the finding of this court that the defamatory effect was not that there was corruption within the Cabinet but that the Cabinet had allowed such corruption to arise at the highest echelons external to itself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The CMA charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Before the Judge below, the Prosecution submitted that the second appellant had used Mr Sim’s Yahoo Account without authority for the purpose of sending out the Email on 4 September 2018.

This seems to be quite a natural way for a witness’ mind to work while he is on the stand, especially when he is trying to recall events which happened a decade or more ago. Clouds of uncertainty regarding his memory may form when a different and more specific question is asked, and it is simply honest for him to acknowledge that he is in fact not entirely confident in his recollection. In any case, Mr Sim’s evidence relating to the 2008 Article is peripheral to the main thrust of his narrative concerning the Yahoo Account. The alleged aberrations, even if present, certainly do not impact his credibility or that of his narrative in general.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Contrary to the second appellant’s next argument, Mr Sim’s failure to take actions to reassert control over the Yahoo Account did not constitute implied consent for the second appellant to use the Yahoo Account to send any type of email. There are other, more plausible reasons for Mr Sim’s inaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 First, Mr Sim testified that when he found out that the second appellant had been sending emails from the Yahoo Account without his knowledge, he spoke to the second appellant and told him that he should not use Mr Sim’s personal accounts to send emails to other addressees without his permission.

He remained in need of the second appellant’s help and also faced significant difficulties in changing his account passwords. Taken together, these factors explain Mr Sim’s inaction both when he found out that the second appellant had been sending emails without his knowledge and during the period from 2016 to 2018 when he forgot the password to the Yahoo Account. These instances of inaction therefore do not evince Mr Sim’s implied consent to the sending of emails to other third parties without his knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Overall, Mr Sim’s account of the events relating to the Yahoo Account was both internally and externally consistent. He coherently explained why he had given the second appellant access to his Yahoo Account, which was for the second appellant to help send emails on his behalf to government departments regarding his bankruptcy, HDB and traffic summons matters as he had a poor command of English.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Sulochana d/o Tambiah Dirumala Sakkrawarthi v Rajalakshmi Ramoo </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 214 at [23], the following non-exhaustive list of factors that would determine the seriousness of an offence under s 500 was set out:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The nature of the defamatory remark;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The conduct, position and standing of the defamed party; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The mode and extent of the publication; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) The conduct of the defendant after making the defamatory comments.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Based on the findings above at [41], the nature of the defamatory remark in this case is different from what the Judge found it to be. Instead of being an imputation that the members of the Cabinet themselves were corrupt, the defamatory remark was that “corruption at the highest echelons” had arisen under the watch of the members of the Cabinet, and thus that they were responsible for it due to their incompetence. This imputation is less serious than the allegation that members of the Cabinet were themselves corrupt, since it imputes only incompetence to the members of the Cabinet instead of corruption. Thus, the Judge’s finding that the imputation was grave because it besmirched the integrity of public leaders is not relevant.

</div> Furthermore, the nature of the platform is also a relevant consideration – TOC was a relatively well-known alternative news platform with its own staff and editors, and the first appellant acknowledged that TOC held itself out as “an independent media platform to turn to for social political news and views” with the aim of providing “honest, objective, independent and factual reporting”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Taking the above factors as a whole, and especially considering the less serious nature of the defamatory remark, the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment each for the criminal defamation charges is manifestly excessive. The imputation that was made out was that the Cabinet members through their incompetence had allowed corruption to infect the establishment or the elite in Singapore. This was a less venal attack on integrity and credit than one alleging personal corruption on the part of the Cabinet, and should be reflected in a lower sentence. This difference in gravity would also be reflected in the type of punishment: the sentencing response does not need to cross into the custodial range, and a fine would be sufficient punishment. A fine would also to my mind act as sufficient deterrence, both specifically and generally. Given the target of the attack and the reach, the starting point would be a fine at the maximum of $10,000, given these are magistrate’s arrest cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125  Thus, a reduction of sentence to a fine of $10,000 (in default three weeks’ imprisonment) is appropriate for the second appellant. There was little to mitigate or reduce the sentence from the starting point. A lower fine is appropriate for the first appellant, considering his compliance and cooperation with the authorities; the sentence imposed is a fine of $8,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment). The first appellant chose to serve the imprisonment sentence imposed below even while pursuing this appeal. I will hear counsel for the first appellant and the Prosecution on what should thus follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The CMA charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The sentence of three months’ imprisonment imposed for the CMA charge is not manifestly excessive. The second appellant’s culpability is high and there was harm caused to Mr Sim. Several factors indicated the severity of the offending conduct, including the planned and systematic nature of the second appellant’s behaviour, the abuse of trust reposed in him by Mr Sim, the longstanding conduct of accessing Mr Sim’s other online accounts without consent for years, and the significant harm caused to Mr Sim. The second appellant also showed a lack of remorse by making several dubious claims in his defence at trial which flew in the face of the evidence, as discussed above at [118]. Thus, considering the severity of the offending conduct and the lack of any mitigating factors, there is no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by the Judge in respect of the CMA charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The appellants’ appeals against conviction with respect to all charges and the second appellant’s appeal against sentence for the CMA charge are dismissed. The appeals against sentence for the criminal defamation charges are allowed, and the sentences of imprisonment imposed are set aside and substituted by the fines as noted at [125] above.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Choo Zheng Xi and Yuen Ai Zhen Carol (Remy Choo Chambers LLC) for the appellant in HC/MA 9073/2022/01;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chung Ting Fai (Chung Ting Fai &amp; Co) for the appellant in<br/>HC/MA 9078/2022/01;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Faizal SC, Andre Chong Wei Min and Niranjan Ranjakunalan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent in HC/MA 9073/2022/01 and HC/MA 9078/2022/01.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
