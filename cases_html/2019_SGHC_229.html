[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The word “may” in s 182 of the Act shows that an order under the section is not granted as of right, but is a matter of the court’s discretion: <span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad Akhtar v Suresh Agarwal and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1032 (“<span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad</span>”) at [40].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In determining whether the court’s discretion ought to be exercised, the court proceeds on a holistic assessment, which “entails an assessment of whether there is indeed impracticability and whether such impracticability is of a sufficient degree as to call for the intervention of the court”:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Lim Yew Ming v Aik Chuan Construction Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2015] 3 SLR 931 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Yew Ming</span>”) at [23].  Impracticability is not a threshold requirement, as “matters going to impracticability and the exercise of discretion will overlap considerably”: <span class="font-italic">Lim Yew Ming </span>at [23].  Hence, rather than a two-step assessment, which would require proof of impracticability as a precursor to the exercise of discretion, the appropriate approach to be taken is a holistic one, with impracticability forming part of the overall assessment as to whether the court’s discretion ought to be exercised in favour of calling a meeting under s 182 of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prima facie case for relief</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad </span>at [41]–[42]<span class="font-italic">, </span>Hoo Sheau Peng JC (as she then was) observed that, where a s 182 application is brought by a majority shareholder in an attempt to break a deadlock caused by “the refusal of minority members to attend meetings with a view towards blocking the passage of resolutions unfavourable to them”, even where a director may otherwise be removed by such a resolution, a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for relief under s 182 is presented.  This “majority rule principle” flows from two propositions (<span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad </span>at [40], citing <span class="font-italic">Re Woven Rugs Ltd </span>[2002] 1 BCLC 324 with approval):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Majority shareholders normally have the right to appoint and remove directors</span> and this is an important consideration that must be borne in mind when considering the exercise of the court’s discretion. In the UK, this right is statutorily enshrined in s 168(1) of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK) (“UK CA 2006”). In Singapore, s 152 of the [Act] confers majority shareholders of public companies the statutory right to remove and appoint directors by ordinary resolution notwithstanding anything which may be found in the companies’ memoranda or articles of association. In the case of private companies, there is no equivalent statutory provision though Art 69 of Table A (which applies to all companies unless specifically excluded: see s 36(2) of the [Act]) states that the company may b[y] ordinary resolution remove any director before the expiration of his period of office.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Quorum provisions cannot be regarded as conferring on the minority a form of veto in relation to company business</span>. The rights of the majority in this regard cannot be stultified by minority members absenting themselves in order to prevent resolutions unfavourable to them from being passed (see [<span class="font-italic">Re Opera Photographic Ltd</span> [1989] 1WLR 634] at 637B–637C).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Similar observations about the importance of utilising s 182 of the Act to prevent the use of the quorum requirement by minority shareholders to defeat the will of the majority were made in <span class="font-italic">Lim Yew Ming </span>by Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) at [51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What is required is that the court should make a holistic assessment, considering whether the events, omission or other actions require its intervention. As a matter of principle, impracticability is made out in the present case as the refusal of members to attend meetings perverts the point of membership and the meeting process. As has been emphasised in the English cases discussed above, a minority shareholder or member cannot use the quorum provision as a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> veto mechanism, allowing him to obstruct the desires of the majority shareholder. A meeting is a mechanism to allow decisions to be made. Proposals are meant to be put, debated and voted upon. The quorum is to ensure only that there is at least a minimal opportunity to debate and convince<span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> It is part of the structure of a proper meeting. On the other hand, allowing the minority to cause the meeting to fail by staying away gives them a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> veto, allowing them to scupper the mechanism of decision-making. The proposal is not defeated through persuasion and tallying of those empowered to decide, as it should be; instead, it is defeated by the minority by their refusal to allow the matter to go to a vote at all. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Veto by lack of quorum is nothing more than the imposition of the will of the minority on the majority.</span> In my view, such impracticability justifies the court exercising its powers under s 182 of the [Act]. [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In this case, the defendants, representing the minority shareholders, have refused to attend the EGMs convened by the plaintiff and LMF with a view to prevent the passage of the resolutions to remove them from their positions as directors of the company.  Hence, a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for relief under s 182 of the Act has been established.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 182 of the Act is a procedural section which cannot be used to override substantive rights of shareholders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 That having been said, it has been observed that s 182 of the Act is a “procedural section”, which is only intended “to enable company business which needs to be conducted at a general meeting of the company to be so conducted”: <span class="font-italic">Union Music Ltd and another v Watson and another </span>[2003] 1 BCLC 453 at [32].  Being a procedural section, it cannot be used to override the substantive rights of shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad </span>at [48].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The procedural nature of the section is illustrated in <span class="font-italic">Harman v BML Group Ltd </span>[1994] 1 WLR 893 (“<span class="font-italic">Harman</span>”).  There, one Mr Blumenthal held all 190,000 B shares in the company.  Apart from the B shares, there were 310,000 A shares, of which 260,000 were collectively held by the applicants, Mr Harman and Mr Mills.  Two other minority shareholders held the remaining 50,000 A shares.  The A and B shares ranked <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>in all respects, save as to certain pre-emption rights.  The company’s articles provided that Mr Blumenthal was entitled to remain in office as a director of the company so long as he owned the B shares.  The articles also provided that a shareholders’ meeting would not have a quorum unless a B shares shareholder or proxy was present.  Mr Blumenthal and the other minority shareholders made certain allegations against Mr Harman and Mr Mills about their misappropriation of the company funds.  Following which, Mr Harman and Mr Mills took out an application under s 371 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK), the English equivalent of s 182 of the Act, to convene a meeting by any two members of the company.  The judge allowed the application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 On appeal, the English Court of Appeal unanimously reversed the judge’s decision, holding that the class rights attached to Mr Blumenthal’s B shares, which entitled him to be represented in the quorum, could not be overridden by the English equivalent of s 182 of the Act (<span class="font-italic">Harman </span>at 898):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is not right … to invoke section 371 to override class rights attached to a class of shares which have been deliberately — in this case by the shareholders' agreement — imposed for the protection of the holders of those shares, although they are a minority. It is not the case that the overriding position is that the majority shareholders must prevail on everything. Class rights have to be respected and I regard the right of [Mr Blumenthal], as the holder of the B shares, to be present in the quorum as a class right for his protection which is not to be overridden by this machinery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In summary, “the <span class="font-italic">substantive </span>rights of shareholders (whether for equal management participation or a guaranteed directorship or otherwise) cannot be abrogated by s 182” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad </span>at [48]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 From my analysis of the parties’ submissions, the answer to the issue of whether the court should grant leave for an inquorate meeting to be held boils down to a determination of the following issue – whether the defendants have a <span class="font-italic">substantive </span>right to participate in the management of the company by remaining as directors.  If such a right to management is indeed shown to exist, then the court should grant not leave to convene the inquorate EGM, as such would enable the majority shareholders to remove the defendants as directors of the company, thereby overriding their expectation and right to participate in the management.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendants have a substantive right to participate in the management</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For the reasons I have set out in full in my judgment to CWU 78/2018, I find that Connectus Group is a quasi-partnership between AS, SS, APBA and LMF (or the Lim family), such that AS and SS have a right to involvement in the management of the company as directors.  In summary, my reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Connectus Group was established as a joint venture by a collection of individuals who had come together to build a human resources services business.  Each of them had an active role to play in the building of the business and it was intended that, in so far as AS, SS and Lim Tien Ho (“LTH”) were concerned, they were to be full-time employees who would make their livelihood from the company’s business.

</div> and was thus a considered response, which reflects APBA’s (and PN’s) admission that the understanding between the shareholders, notwithstanding the termination of the SHA, was that the shareholders would have a role to play in managing Connectus Group. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As I find that the defendants have a right to participate in the management of the company as directors, I am unable to agree with the plaintiff that I should exercise my powers under s 182 of the Act to sanction the calling of an EGM for the passing of resolutions for their removal as directors.  In principle, it is irrelevant in my view that the defendants’ rights arise from the informal arrangement between the parties rather than being recorded in the articles or an effective shareholders’ agreement, as in the case of <span class="font-italic">Harman</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Given my conclusion above, there is no need for me to express any views in this judgment as to the other allegations raised by the plaintiff concerning the defendants’ conduct.  But, these are dealt with in my judgment in CWU 78/2018.  In a nutshell, I find that the plaintiff has not established on the evidence before me that AS and SS had acted against the interests of Connectus Group or otherwise breached their duties as directors.  In any event, if the plaintiff was honestly of the view that AS and/or SS had indeed breached their directors’ duties and caused loss to the company, it was always open to the plaintiff to have sought leave to bring a derivative action under s 216A of the Act in the name of the company against the defendants.  The procedural remedy under s 182 of the Act is not the appropriate one to pursue on the facts of the present case: see also <span class="font-italic">Naseer Ahmad </span>at [84]–[86].   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the reasons set out above, and which are spelt out in more detail in CWU 78/2018, I am dismissing the plaintiff’s application.  I should add that, even if I was of the view that the plaintiff had made out its case under s 182 of the Act, I would not have granted the plaintiff relief given my decision in CWU 78/2018 that AS has established his case that the company should be wound up on just and equitable grounds.  Given those circumstances, there would have been no point in making any order under s 182 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I will hear parties separately on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Khoo Ching Shin Shem and Teo Hee Sheng, Christian (Focus Law Asia LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Rajiv Nair (GKS Law LLC) for the first and second defendants;<br/>The third defendant absent and unrepresented. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
