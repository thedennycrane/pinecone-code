<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this summons, the defendant, Lee Wee Lick
                    Terence (“the Defendant”), applied to set aside the adjudication
                    determination dated 7 July 2010 (“the Adjudication Determination”)
                    made by Mr Ian de Vaz (“the Adjudicator”) in which the Adjudicator
                    awarded the plaintiff, Chua Say Eng (“the Plaintiff”), the sum of
                    $125,450.40. The Adjudication Determination had been made pursuant to an
                    application by the Plaintiff under s 17 of the Building and Construction
                    Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap. 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    SOPA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This application raises three interesting
                    issues. First, I have to consider whether the court, in a setting aside
                    application, should review the adjudicator’s decision as to the validity
                    of an alleged payment claim. Second, a question arose as to whether service, in
                    the case of an individual, can be effected by leaving the payment claim at the
                    last known address of the place of residence of that individual. Third, I have
                    to determine whether the SOPA prescribes a limitation period within which a
                    payment claim must be served. Before delving into a discussion of these issues,
                    it is apposite that I set out the relevant factual background.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff is in the business of building and
                    renovation works. On 16 August 2008, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff as
                    the main contractor for reconstruction works to convert his two-storey house at
                    1 Pasir Ris Heights (“the Construction Address”) into a
                    three-storey house (“the Project”) for the sum of $420,000.00
                    (“the Contract”). Subsequently, the Plaintiff and the Defendant
                    agreed to increase the scope of the Contract to cater for additional works and
                    changes in design. As a result, the total contract sum increased to
                    $542,000.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 8 February 2010, the Defendant alleged
                    that the Plaintiff was in repudiatory breach and gave the Plaintiff ‘Final
                    Notice’ to provide certain information, undertakings and documents by
                    13 February 2010, failing which the Defendant would accept the
                    Plaintiff’s alleged repudiation. By way of letter dated 21 April
                    2010, the Defendant purported to accept the Plaintiff’s repudiation and
                    terminated the Contract. In the same letter, the Plaintiff was instructed to
                    vacate the site of the Project by 12pm on 26 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In early May 2010, the Plaintiff obtained a
                    valuation report which expressed the view that the value of the work done as at
                    1 May 2010 was $350,450.40 (“the Evaluated Amount”).
                    Accordingly, on 2 June 2010, the Plaintiff served a Payment Claim No. 6
                    (“the Payment Claim”) on the Defendant claiming a sum of
                    $140,450.40 for work done from June 2009 to 26 April 2010. This sum
                    represented the outstanding amount due after deducting the previous payments
                    made from the Evaluated Amount. Service (of the Payment Claim) was effected by
                    leaving the Payment Claim under the front door of the Defendant’s
                    residential address at Block 117, Edgefield Plains #17-316 (“the
                    Residential Address”) at around 7.30pm, and by depositing the Payment
                    Claim in the mailbox of the Construction Address at around 6.45pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As the Contract is silent on when a payment
                    response should be served, s 11(1)(b) of the SOPA mandates that the payment
                    response be served within 7 days after the payment claim is served. As the
                    Payment Claim was served on 2 June 2010, the due date for the relevant
                    payment response was 9 June 2010. It is common ground that the Defendant
                    did not serve a payment response on the Plaintiff by 9 June 2010 or at
                    all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Adjudication Determination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Pursuant to s 12(5) of the SOPA, the
                    dispute settlement period expired on 16 June 2010. On 18 June 2010, in
                    compliance with s 13(2) of the SOPA, the Plaintiff served the Defendant
                    with a Notice of Intention to Apply for Adjudication (“the
                    Notice”) by leaving the Notice under the front door of the Residential
                    Address at 6.45pm, and by depositing the Notice in the mailbox of the
                    Construction Address at 7.10pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 22 June 2010, the Plaintiff filed an
                    adjudication application (“the Adjudication Application”) with the
                    Singapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”). Later that same day, the SMC
                    served the Adjudication Application on the Defendant at the Residential Address.
                    Pursuant to s 15(1) of the SOPA, the Defendant must, within 7 days of
                    receipt of a copy of an adjudication application, lodge an adjudication response
                    with the SMC. Accordingly, the Defendant had up to 29 June 2010 to lodge an
                    adjudication response with the SMC. It is again not disputed that the Defendant
                    did not lodge an Adjudication Response with the SMC by 29 June 2010 or at
                    all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 7 July 2010, the Adjudicator released
                    the Adjudication Determination, which awarded the Plaintiff a sum of
                    $125,450.40. The Defendant has now applied to set aside the Adjudication
                    Determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The issues arising out of this application are
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Payment Claim was a
                        valid payment claim under the SOPA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Payment Claim was served in accordance with
                        the SOPA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the Payment Claim, if it had been served in accordance with the
                        SOPA, was nevertheless served out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will now
                    address each of these issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Payment Claim was a valid payment claim under the
                SOPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The issue of whether the Payment Claim
                    constituted a valid payment claim under the SOPA was raised before the
                    Adjudicator. As such, a preliminary question that needs to be answered is
                    whether, in a setting aside application, the court ought to be reviewing the
                    Adjudicator’s decision on such matters. On this point, there appears to be
                    a possible conflict of authority. In <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd
                        v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 733
                        (“<em>SEF Construction</em>”), Judith
                    Prakash J held that a court hearing a setting aside application under
                    s 27(5) of the SOPA may only consider issues relating to the
                    “appointment and conduct of the adjudicator” and not the merits of
                    the case. At [42] of her Judgment, Prakash J held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, instead of reviewing the merits (in any direct or indirect
                        fashion), it is my view that the court's role must be limited to supervising
                        the appointment and conduct of the adjudicator to ensure that the statutory
                        provisions governing such appointment and conduct are adhered to and that
                        the process of the adjudication, rather than the substance, is proper. After
                        all, in any case, even if the adjudicator does make an error of fact or law
                        in arriving at his adjudication determination, such error can be rectified
                        or compensated for in subsequent arbitration or court proceedings initiated
                        in accordance with the contract between the claimant and the respondent and
                        intended to resolve all contractual disputes that have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">More pertinently, Prakash J went on to hold, at [46],
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Similarly, although the SOP Act requires a payment claim to
                        be served, <em>whether or not the document purporting to be a
                            payment claim which has been served by a claimant is actually a payment
                            claim is an issue for the adjudicator and not the court</em>. In
                        this respect, I agree entirely with Hodgson JA's reasoning in <em>Brodyn</em> (([32] <em>supra</em>)
                        at [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... If there is a document served by a claimant on a respondent that
                            purports to be a payment claim under the Act, questions as to whether
                            the document complies in all respects with the requirements of the Act
                            are generally, in my opinion, for the adjudicator to decide. Many of
                            these questions can involve doubtful questions of act and law; and as I
                            have indicated earlier, in my opinion the legislature has manifested an
                            intention that the existence of a determination should not turn on
                            answers to questions of this kind. However, I do not need to express a
                            final view on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On this reasoning, the issue of whether a
                    document purporting to be a payment claim is a payment claim under the SOPA
                    would be a matter for the adjudicator, and not the court. It would logically
                    follow from this that a court should not consider the issue of the validity of a
                    payment claim in a setting aside application. However, in the recent case of
                        <em>Sungdo Engineering &amp; Construction (S) Pte Ltd v
                        Italcor Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 459 (“<em>Sungdo</em>”), Lee Seiu Kin J took the view that since
                    the validity of a payment claim goes to jurisdiction, the court is not precluded
                    from examining this issue on judicial review. At [34] of his Grounds of
                    Decision, Lee J held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In principle, <em>if the validity of a Payment
                            Claim goes to jurisdiction, I do not see how a court is precluded from
                            examining this issue on judicial review</em> and I would, with
                        respect, disagree with this. Notwithstanding this, the 2008 Letter did not
                        purport to be a payment claim under the Act as nothing therein states that
                        it is so. Therefore <em>SEF Construction</em> does not
                        stand in the way of my decision in the present case. However I should state
                        that in practice, <em>where a document purports to be a
                            Payment Claim, then unless the adjudicator has made an unreasonable
                            finding on the evidence</em> (unreasonableness as in <em>Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury
                            Corporation</em> [1948] 1 KB 223), <em>his decision that it satisfies all the requirements of a Payment Claim
                            may not be interfered with by the court</em> when exercising its
                        powers of judicial review. This appears to be the offset of the following
                        passage in <em>Brodyn</em> (at [66]), which was cited
                        in <em>SEF Construction</em> at [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... If there is a document served by a claimant on a respondent that
                            purports to be a payment claim under the Act, question as to whether the
                            document complies in all respects with the requirements of the Act
                                <em>are generally, in my opinion, for the adjudicator
                                to decide</em>. Many of these questions can involve doubtful
                            questions of [f]act and law; and as I have indicated earlier, in my
                            opinion the legislature has manifested an intention that the existence
                            of a determination should not turn on answers to questions of this kind.
                            However, I do not need to express a final view on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The court in <em>SEF
                        Construction</em> had followed the decision of the New South Wales
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport</em>
                    [2004] NSWCA 394 (“<em>Brodyn</em>”). In <em>Brodyn</em>, Hodgson JA
                    had opined that the court should only review an adjudicator’s decision as
                    regards whether the “basic and essential” requirements of the New
                    South Wales legislation (<em>ie</em>, the Building and

                    Act”)) were fulfilled. In his opinion, whether a payment claim was served
                    in accordance with the NSW Act was an issue for the adjudicator and not the
                    court. Prakash J had affirmed this view at [46] of <em>SEF
                        Construction</em>. It may be relevant to note that the approach in
                        <em>Brodyn</em> has been departed from in <em>Chase Oyster Bar v Hamo Industries</em>
                    [2010] NSWCA 190 (“<em>Chase
                    Oyster</em>”). In <em>Chase Oyster</em>, the
                    claimant had failed to serve in time a notice of intention (to apply for
                    adjudication) as required by the NSW Act. The Court of Appeal held that service
                    in time of the notice of intention was a requirement which affected the validity
                    of the adjudication. Departing from the more narrow approach in <em>Brodyn</em>, the court held, at [149], that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The decision in <em>Brodyn</em> appears to assume
                        that there is a distinction between a basic and essential requirement for
                        the existence of an adjudicator’s determination and a jurisdictional
                        condition, or jurisdictional fact. However, the decision does not analyse
                        the relevant requirements of the Act in terms of jurisdiction; the framework
                        of analysis was restricted by the search for basic and essential conditions
                        of validity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">McDougall J went on to emphasise why strict adherence with the
                    requirements of the NSW Act was necessary and held, at [208]–[209],
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, the <em>Security of Payment Act</em>
                        operates in a way that has been described as “rough and ready”
                        or, less kindly, as “Draconian”. It imposes a mandatory regime
                        regardless of the parties’ contract: s 34. It provides extremely
                        abbreviated time frames for the exchange of payment claims, payment
                        schedules, adjudication applications and adjudication responses. It provides
                        a very limited time for adjudicators to make their decisions on what,
                        experience shows, are often extremely complex claims involving very
                        substantial volumes of documents (see, for example, my decision in <em>Laing O’Rourke Australia Construction v H&amp;M
                            Engineering and Construction</em> [2010] NSWSC 818 at
                        [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Security of Payment Act</em> gives very
                        valuable, and commercially important, advantages to builders and
                        subcontractors. At each stage of the regime for enforcement of the statutory
                        right to progress payments, the <em>Security of Payment
                            Act</em> lays down clear specifications of time and other
                        requirements to be observed. It is not difficult to understand that the
                        availability of those rights should depend on strict observance of the
                        statutory requirements that are involved in their creation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Therefore, I am of the view that, as held in
                        <em>Sungdo</em> and <em>Chase
                        Oyster</em>, the issue of the validity of a payment claim is one that
                    the court <em>can</em> review. However, as Prakash J
                    points out in <em>Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd v
                        Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 658 at [57], the policy behind the SOPA is that of assisting in
                    “maintaining cash flow in the [construction] industry while disputes
                    [are] settled via arbitration or court proceedings” by providing
                    “a fast track procedure for an interim decision in respect of a disputed
                    payment claim”. This policy would be frustrated if the court must
                    invariably look into the parties’ arguments before the adjudicator. As
                    Prakash J noted in <em>SEF Construction</em> at
                    [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the court were to be allowed to look into questions of substance or
                        quantum including questions like whether a proper payment claim had been
                        served by the claimant, the procedure is likely to be expensive and
                        prolonged. One can very easily envisage a situation (in fact such situations
                        have already occurred) where the dissatisfied respondent first applies to
                        the court for the adjudication determination to be set aside on the ground
                        that, for example, the adjudication response should not have been rejected,
                        and then when that application is rejected by the assistant registrar,
                        appeals to the judge in chambers and finally when the appeal is
                        unsuccessful, appeals again to the Court of Appeal. Bearing in mind that the
                        adjudication process could have been a two-step process involving a review,
                        that would mean five steps in all before the dispute regarding the
                        claimant's payment claim is finally disposed of. The more steps there are,
                        the longer the process will take and the more expensive it will be. Such an
                        outcome would be contrary to the intention of Parliament that the
                        adjudication procedure should afford speedy <em>interim</em> relief. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In my view, the approach that best gives
                    effect to both <em>Sungdo</em> and <em>SEF
                        Construction</em> (which are admittedly not completely reconcilable)
                    as well as the policy behind the SOPA is that generally, the court in a setting
                    aside application should not delve into the details of whether an alleged
                    payment claim complies with the requirements of the SOPA as long as the
                    document, on its face, <em>purports</em> to be a payment
                    claim under the SOPA. In other words, if the document expressly states that it
                    is a payment claim under the SOPA or even simply states that it is a payment
                    claim, then unless the adjudicator has made an unreasonable finding on the
                    evidence, the court should not interfere with his decision that all the
                    requirements of the SOPA are fulfilled. In contrast, if the document appears, on
                    its face, to either be something other than a payment claim (as was the case in
                        <em>Sungdo</em>) or to clearly fall afoul of one of the
                    requirements set out in the SOPA and the Building and Construction Industry
                    Security of Payment Regulations (Cap. 30B, Rg 1, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the SOPR”), then the court should examine the document and make
                    a determination as to whether it actually is a payment claim within the meaning
                    of s 10. As Lee J alluded to in <em>Sungdo</em>
                    at [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While I agree that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is not vested until
                        his appointment by an ANB, I am, with respect, unable to agree that
                        jurisdiction is not affected by an invalid Payment Claim or service thereof.
                        The power of the ANB to appoint an adjudicator arises from the receipt of an
                        adjudication application from a claimant, and that is predicated by a whole
                        chain of events initiated by the service of a Payment Claim by the claimant
                        on the respondent under s 10 of the Act. It must follow that <em>if the claimant had failed to serve a Payment Claim, or to
                            serve something that constitutes a Payment Claim, the power to appoint
                            an adjudicator for that particular claim has not arisen</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In determining whether a payment claim is a valid one under the SOPA,
                    the court would have to consider whether the requirements in the SOPA and the
                    SOPR, in particular s 10(3) of the SOPA and reg 5(2) of the SOPR, are
                    complied with. In addition, although it is clear that there is no requirement
                    that a payment claim must contain a statement that it is a payment claim under
                    the SOPA, the court in <em>Sungdo</em> appears to have
                    imposed a further requirement, namely that for a document to amount to a payment
                    claim under the SOPA, the party submitting it must intend it to be such. At [20]
                    of his Grounds of Decision, Lee J stated this further requirement as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Be that as it may, since it is not a requirement under the Act, the
                        absence of a statement that a document is a Payment Claim does not of itself
                        preclude that document from being one. But the defendant's contention that
                        any document that satisfies all the requirements under the Act and the
                        Regulations as to how it is made and what it must contain would amount to a
                        Payment Claim is quite another manner. This would mean that a document
                        containing all such information but also containing the statement "This is
                        not a payment claim under the Act" would be a payment claim under the Act,
                        which would be contrary to commonsense. To the argument that in such a
                        situation the claimant is estopped from relying on it as a Payment Claim,
                        there are two responses. The first is that this argument will not address
                        the situation where the respondent, out of an abundance of caution, submits
                        a payment response and therefore has not been prejudiced. The second is a
                        matter of principle: surely intention must be a necessary element and such a
                        document cannot be a Payment Claim even if it contains all the prescribed
                        requirements for one, simply because it was not intended to be one by the
                        maker of the document. In my view, <em>for a document to
                            amount to a payment claim under the Act, the party submitted it must
                            intend it to be such</em>, and I so hold. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Relying on <em>Sungdo</em>, the Defendant contended that the Payment Claim was not a
                    valid payment claim under the SOPA because the Plaintiff did not intend it to be
                    a payment claim under the SOPA, and in any case, had not communicated such an
                    intention to the Defendant. However, as discussed above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>, if a document <em>purports</em>, on its face, to be a payment claim, then its validity
                    as a payment claim under the SOPA is an issue that should be determined by the
                    adjudicator. I am of the view that the Payment Claim submitted by the Plaintiff
                    clearly <em>purports</em> to be a payment claim under the
                    SOPA. In the first place, there is no dispute that the Payment Claim complies
                    with all the requirements prescribed by the SOPA and the SOPR. Second, the title
                    block of the Payment Claim itself describes the document as “Payment
                    Claim No. 6”; and the text of the body opens with the line “[w]e
                    submit our payment claim number 6 for work done from June 2009 to 26 April
                    2010”. The “amount due/claimed” is then set out, with the
                    details of the amount claimed separately attached. Third, the cover letter of
                    the Payment Claim is printed on the Plaintiff’s letterhead, and is signed
                    and dated. Care was also taken such that every page (of the cover letter and the
                    attachments) contains the Plaintiff’s stamp and is signed. In my view, the
                    fact that the Payment Claim complies with all the requirements of the SOPA and
                    the SOPR, its express title, and the general formality of the Payment Claim
                    justifies a finding that it <em>purported</em> to be a
                    payment claim under the SOPA. By way of comparison, the document in <em>Sungdo</em> was distinctly informal. For starters, it was
                    titled “Letter from Italcor to Sungdo” and concluded with the
                    following festive greeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, we wish you greetings of the season!</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The informality was enhanced by the fact that the person signing it
                    was not identified and the date was handwritten. The document also appears to
                    have been written in response to questions as to whether the work had been
                    completed. This can be gleaned from the second paragraph of the document, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to your questioning of whether we have done the work, we wish
                        to assure you that the work in respect of the following invoices have been
                        done and we claim for payment for such work as follows...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the words “claim for payment” were used, the
                    general tenor of the document was more akin to an informal letter than to a
                    payment claim under the SOPA. Furthermore, in <em>Sungdo</em>, Lee J found (at [26]) that the events prior to the
                    service corroborated a finding that the document was not intended to be a
                    payment claim under the SOPA. In the present case, the Defendant was not able to
                    point to any such overt acts by the Plaintiff (which could indicate that the
                    Payment Claim was not to be treated as a payment claim under the SOPA) other
                    than the fact that there were two previous claims that were not submitted for
                    adjudication, namely “Contract Progress Claim No: 4” and
                    “Contract Progress Claim No. 5”. I note that these claims were
                    described as progress claims and were neither signed nor dated. Furthermore,
                    they were not prefaced by a cover letter. As such, I am of the view that the
                    existence of such previous claims that were not submitted for adjudication has
                    no bearing on the question of whether the Payment Claim purported to be a
                    payment claim under the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that
                    there are any reasonable grounds for interfering with the Adjudicator’s
                    determination that the Payment Claim was a valid payment claim under the
                    SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Payment Claim was served in accordance with the
                SOPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The second issue raises the novel question of
                    what constitutes effective service of a payment claim on a private individual in
                    the context of the SOPA. It is perhaps not surprising that this issue does not
                    seem to have generated controversy in adjudications where the respondent is a
                    corporate or commercial entity since presumably where such an entity is
                    involved, there would be proper administrative systems and processes in place to
                    record when documents are delivered or served on the entity. Hence, the question
                    of whether a document has been effectively served on the entity or not seldom
                    arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The crux of the Defendant’s submission
                    is that he did not receive the Payment Claim when it was served by the Plaintiff
                    at the Residential Address. In this regard, the Plaintiff has exhibited
                    documents from a courier service which indicate that the Payment Claim was
                    delivered to the Residential Address on 2 June 2010 at approximately 7.30pm
                    and was “slid under the door” when the courier found that
                    “nobody was home”. The Defendant does not contest the authenticity
                    of the documents from the courier service, but claims that his wife or the
                    domestic helper might have inadvertently disposed of the Payment Claim when it
                    was slipped under the front door of the Residential Address as the front door
                    was located near where scrap paper (intended for disposal or recycling) was
                    stored. The Defendant emphasises the fact that there is no evidence that he
                    actually received the Payment Claim, and that accordingly, there had not been
                        <em>personal service</em> of the Payment Claim as
                    required by the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As the treatment of this issue necessarily
                    involves extensive references to s 37 of the SOPA, it would be helpful to
                    set out the section in its entirety:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The provisions of this section are in addition to, and do

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defendant’s contention is that there
                    had not been proper service of the Payment Claim since it had not been served in
                    accordance with any of the methods prescribed in s 37(1) of the SOPA. On
                    the other hand, the Plaintiff contends that there was effective service because
                    they had left the Payment Claim at the usual or last known address of the place
                    of residence of the Defendant and that this complies fully with
                    s 48A(1)(a)(ii) of the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“Interpretation Act”) which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Service of documents</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        authorises or requires a document to be served on a person, whether the
                        expression “serve”, “give” or
                        “send” or any other expression is used, then, unless the
                        contrary intention appears, the document may be served —</p>

                        of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, the presence of the word “may” in
                    s 37(1) of the SOPA is indicative of and consonant with the permissive
                    nature of the section. Furthermore, s 37(3) of the SOPA states that the
                    provisions of s 37 are “in addition to, and do not limit or
                    exclude, the provisions of any other law with respect to the service of
                    documents”. This underscores the fact that the modes of service
                    stipulated in the SOPA are not exhaustive and that there is clearly scope for
                    other modes of service of documents as prescribed by “any other
                    law”, and this would necessarily include the modes of service provided
                    for in the Interpretation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Defendant drew my attention to the tight
                    timelines that are imposed following the service of a payment claim and to the
                    serious consequences that entail a failure to file a payment response, and thus
                    argued that Parliament must have intended that a payment claim should, like the
                    originating processes of the Singapore courts, be <em>personally</em> served. Although I am conscious of the difficulties
                    that individuals may face if payment claims are not personally served, I am of
                    the view that it <em>cannot</em> have been
                    Parliament’s intention that a payment claim must be personally served.
                    First, s 37(1) itself does not provide exclusively for personal service as
                    s 37(1)(b) and (c) provide that a payment claim may be served by leaving it
                    during normal business hours at the usual place of business of the person or by
                    sending it to the usual or last known place of business of the person. Second,
                    where personal service of particular documents is required, the relevant
                    legislation will usually lay out some procedure for substituted service (for
                        <em>eg</em>, O 62 r 5 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) in the case of originating
                    processes). The absence of such a procedure for substituted service suggests
                    that Parliament did not intend that payment claims had to be personally served.
                    Third, as noted above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>, the SOPA was
                    enacted primarily for the benefit of persons who have performed construction
                    work by providing a mechanism to sustain case flow. The efficacy and reach of
                    the SOPA would be severely undermined if employers who are individuals could
                    bring themselves out of the reach of the SOPA by simply placing themselves,
                    deliberately or otherwise, out of sight and reach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Therefore, since the Plaintiff had effected
                    service of the Payment Claim on the Defendant on 2 June 2010 in a manner
                    provided for in s 48A(1)(a)(ii) of the Interpretation Act, I find that
                    there had been valid and regular service of the Payment Claim for the purposes
                    of the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Payment Claim was served out of time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I turn now to consider the final issue of
                    whether the Payment Claim was served out of time. The kernel of the
                    Defendant’s contention on this issue is that the collective effect of
                    s 10(2) of the SOPA read with reg 5(1) of the SOPR creates a
                    limitation period for the service of payment claims under the SOPA. In its
                    submissions, the Defendant relied on commentaries by two local authors to
                    support its view that there is a limitation period for the service of payment
                    claims under the SOPA. The first of these commentaries is Philip Chan, <em>Statutory Adjudication in Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                    Asia, 2008) at paras 3.2.8 and 3.2.9:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.2.8 Therefore, it would appear that if any claimed
                            amount has not been properly included in a payment claim as prescribed
                            by s 10(2), it is no longer possible to make a claim that is out of
                            time. Thus, the time of service of the payment claim is also the
                            limitation period for the purpose of claiming an amount in a payment
                            claim. According to s 10(2), this limitation period may be agreed
                            by the parties under s 10(2)(a) or it may be prescribed under
                            s 10(2)(b)...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.2.9 By reg 5(1), the default limitation period
                            for each claimed amount is marked ‘by the last day of each month
                            following the month in which the contract is made’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second commentary relied upon by the Defendant is Chow Kok
                    Fong, <em>Security of Payments and Construction
                        Adjudication</em> (LexisNexis, 2005) (“Chow Kok Fong”)
                    at p 557:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Building and Construction Industry Security of
                            Payment Regulations 2005</em> (hereinafter the ‘BCISP
                        Regulations’) prescribe that the default date is ‘the last day
                        of each month following the month in which the contract is made’. This
                        effectively allows the claimant one month to prepare and submit the payment
                        claim...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Upon clarification from the Defendant’s counsel, I was given to
                    understand that the upshot of the Defendant’s position was that if the
                    Plaintiff wished to claim for work done as at April 2010, the Payment Claim had
                    to be served by 30 April 2010 and not any later as it would then be
                    time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Given that the determination of this issue is
                    likely to hinge heavily on the interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA and
                    reg 5(1) of the SOPR, it would be appropriate to first examine the actual
                    wording of the relevant provisions. Section 10(2) of the SOPA states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Payment claims</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>10</b>. —(2) A payment claim <em>shall</em> be served —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) at such time as specified in or determined in accordance with the
                        terms of the contract; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) where the contract does not contain such provision, <em>at such time as may be prescribed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The time that is prescribed is found in reg 5(1) of the SOPR,
                    which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Payment claims</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5</b>. —(1) Where a contract does not
                        contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim shall be
                        served or by which such time may be determined, then a payment claim made
                        under the contract <em>shall be served by the last day of
                            each month</em> following the month in which the contract is
                        made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my view, the plain words of s 10(2)
                    read with reg 5(1) merely stipulate <em>when</em>
                    payment claims are to be served. I do not read the combined effect of the
                    provisions as supporting the creation of a limitation period that impinges on
                    the <em>scope</em> of claims that can be made in a payment
                    claim. As Chow Kok Fong recognizes at p 131, there is no provision in the
                    SOPA which expressly prohibits payment claims in which sums are claimed for work
                    done some months earlier than the month in which the payment claim is served.
                    The imposition of a limitation period as contended by the Defendant would be a
                    matter with far reaching consequences. If Parliament had intended that there
                    should be a limitation period, it could easily have included a provision to that
                    effect in the SOPA. It is unlikely that Parliament would leave such an important
                    matter to be dealt with in subsidiary legislation. In this regard, it is
                    noteworthy that s 13(4) of the NSW Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>13</b>. —(4) A payment claim may be served
                        only within:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the period determined by or in accordance with the terms of the
                        construction contract; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the period of 12 months after the construction work to which the claim
                        relates was last carried out (or the related goods and services to which the
                        claim relates were last supplied);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since the SOPA was modelled (at least in part) on the NSW Act, the
                    fact that the SOPA does not include a provision similar to s 13(4) supports
                    the conclusion that Parliament did not intend that there should be a limitation
                    period. Furthermore, under s 13(4) of the NSW Act, a payment claim is only
                    time barred on the expiry of 12 months after the construction work to which the
                    payment claim relates was carried out. In contrast, if the Defendant is right,
                    the limitation period imposed by s 10(2) of the SOPA read with
                    reg 5(1) of the SOPR would be only 1 month. In my view, it would not be
                    right to read such a short limitation period, within which a contractor must
                    submit his payment claim or else have all its rights under the SOPA completely
                    forfeited, into the statutory regime without clear words to that effect. As the
                    New South Wales Court of Appeal held in <em>Fyntray Constructions
                        Pty Ltd v Macind Drainage &amp; Hydraulic Services Pty Ltd</em>
                    [2002] NSWCA 238 (“<em>Fyntray</em>”) at [49]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, whether or not the provisions creating a strict regime where
                        claimants are not paid, and the provisions requiring adjudication to be
                        prosecuted expeditiously, point towards the defendant's construction, there
                        is no express language supporting it. <em>The conclusion that
                            the significant statutory rights conferred are only capable of being
                            availed of by claimants within the narrow time period contended for by
                            the defendant could only be drawn if the language used were
                            clear</em>. It is certainly possible for statutory rights of a
                        valuable kind to be granted on the strictest temporal conditions, <em>but in the absence of clear language one would not lightly
                            arrive at a construction having the result that they could be lost by a
                            short delay</em>, whether that delay was the result of intentional
                        behaviour by the claimant, or oversight, or accident, or some intervening
                        and overriding event. And the clear language necessary is language which one
                        would expect to exist not in s 14, dealing with responses to payment
                        schedules, but in s 13, dealing with the conditions which must be
                        satisfied by payment claims. Section 13(2) states formal requirements for
                        payment claims. <em>If there were to be a substantive strict
                            requirement in relation to time, one would expect to find it there. It
                            is not there</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The express words of reg 5(1) do not
                    clearly set out a limitation period, but merely state that a payment claim
                    “shall be served by the last day of each month following the month in
                    which the contract is made”. In essence, for the Defendant’s
                    contention to succeed, the court would have to read reg 5(1) as requiring
                    that a payment claim be served by the last day of each month <em>in which the work was done</em>. There is simply no basis for reading
                    reg 5(1) in this manner since reg 5(1) does not even mention the words
                    “work” or “done”. In my view, the true import of
                    reg 5(1) is two-fold. First, since reg 5(1) states that the payment
                    claim must be served by the last day of the each month <em>following the month in which the contract is made</em>, this means
                    that no payment claim can be served in the month in which the contract is made.
                    This is a sensible position since a plaintiff should generally be expected to
                    complete a certain amount of work before it can make a payment claim. By
                    disallowing the making of a payment claim in the month in which the contract was
                    made, reg 5(1) prevents plaintiffs from swiftly serving payment claims
                    after the completion of merely trivial work. Second, a contract may provide that
                    a payment claim must be served by, on or after a specified day of the month. For
                    example, in <em>Torpey Vander Have Pty Ltd v Mass Constructions
                        Pty Ltd</em> [2002] NSWCA 263 (“<em>Torpey</em>”), the subcontract provided that the subcontractor
                    was entitled to make progress claims on the 25<sup>th</sup> day
                    of each month. Although <em>Torpey</em> involved a progress
                    claim, a contract could just as easily provide for a payment claim to be served
                    by, on or after a specified day of the month. There would be utility in
                    contracting that a payment claim must be served by, on or after a specified day
                    of the month as this would allow potential defendants to know in advance when a
                    payment claim might be forthcoming. For the rest of the month, potential
                    defendants could be assured that they would not be served with payment claims
                    and that any documents they received would not be taken to be a valid payment
                    claim. For example, if a contract provides that a payment claim must be served
                    by the 5<sup>th</sup> day of each month, a potential defendant
                    would not have to worry from the 6<sup>th</sup> day of that
                    month onwards (until the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the next month)
                    that he might be served with a payment claim. In my view, reg 5(1)
                    clarifies that if the contract does not specify that a payment claim must be
                    served by, on or after a specified day of the month, then the default position
                    is that a payment claim must be served “by the last day of the
                    month” (<em>ie</em>, the payment claim can be served
                    on any day of the month).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Considering that the overarching purpose of
                    the SOPA is to provide persons who have performed construction work with a
                    statutory entitlement to a progress payment, I believe that this interpretation,
                    which places fewer fetters on what constitutes a payment claim, is more in
                    keeping with the spirit of the SOPA and should be preferred over competing
                    interpretations. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that s 10(4) of the
                    SOPA contemplates the possibility of a payment claim including amounts which
                    were the subject of earlier payment claims (and presumably for work done much
                    earlier on under the contract). Although s 10(4) relates to amounts subject
                    to <em>earlier payment claims</em> and is thus not strictly
                    relevant to the present application, it does evidence a legislative intent that
                    amounts for work done in previous months could be included in a payment claim. I
                    am cognisant that s 10(4) provides a specific mechanism for the inclusion
                    of such amounts. However, in my view, s 10(4) was meant to <em>widen</em> the scope of s 10(1) by providing an
                        <em>added option</em> of including in a payment claim
                    amounts which were the subject of earlier payment claims. It does not go so far
                    as to require that <em>only if</em> previous payment claims
                    have been submitted can a plaintiff subsequently claim for the
                same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view
                    that this application should be dismissed. I will now hear the parties on
                    costs.</p>
