<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Charter”), when enacted in 1961, wholly changed the
                    prevailing marriage paradigm. In particular, where polygamy was once permissible
                    through diverse customary practices, the Charter introduced a single statutory
                    framework premised upon monogamy for non-Muslim Singaporeans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Notwithstanding this new <em>status quo</em>, arising from s 93 of the Charter, the Court may
                    still be required to consider the ancillaries in cases where polygamous
                    marriages have been validly entered into, either because the marriage was
                    entered into prior to 15 September 1961 (see s 181 of the Charter), or because
                    parties were married under the laws of other countries which once permitted
                    polygamous marriages or which presently still do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the present case, I am to determine the
                    ancillaries arising out of a foreign polygamous marriage. The defendant
                    (“the Husband”), formerly a Malaysian citizen but now a
                    Singaporean citizen, married two wives in Malaysia in the 1970s. Parties do not
                    dispute the validity of either marriage which, as is common ground, took place
                    at a time when polygamy was still permitted in Malaysia for non-Muslims. The
                    plaintiff (“the Wife”) is the Husband’s second
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Following upon their uncontested divorce, the
                    ancillary issues in this case are the division of assets between the parties and
                    maintenance for the Wife. The children of this family are over the age of
                    majority. An interesting legal issue arises on the issue of asset division
                    between the parties: <em>should</em> the valid prior and
                    still subsisting marriage between the Husband and his first wife be taken into
                    account in dividing the matrimonial assets between him and his second wife and,
                    if so, <em>how</em>? This obligation also requires analysis
                    in the context of determining maintenance for the Wife, albeit with an
                    additional factor: the Husband’s obligations to the child of another
                    unmarried partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In addition to the above, this case also
                    presented an opportunity for the Court to consider the principles regulating the
                    use of evidence in the specific context of family ancillary proceedings. I shall
                    turn to address these issues after setting out the facts in greater
                    detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The families</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The parties went through a customary marriage in
                    Ipoh, Malaysia in 1978 followed by the registration of the marriage on 15 June
                    1983 in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> They
                    have four children – three daughters and a son – none of whom are
                    minors. The children were all born in Malaysia and are, namely:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     [A], born on 17 December 1980, now 35
                        years old;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     [B],
                        born on 17 August 1982, now 33 years old;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     [C], born on 13 November 1984, now 31 years old;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     [D], born on
                        18 March 1987, now 28 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Central to the narrative in this case is the
                    Husband’s prior marriage to one Mdm [J], also in Ipoh, pursuant to a
                    customary ceremony in 1973.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The validity of this marriage is not
                    in dispute although the Wife contends that she had no knowledge of it until
                    these proceedings were commenced. The Husband has two children from this
                    marriage who are also above the age of majority. Both children were born in
                    Malaysia, namely:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     [E], born on 20 December 1975, now 40
                        years old;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     [F],
                        born on 2 December 1977, now 38 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       While he was married to the Wife, the Husband
                    also entered into a relationship with one Mdm [K] in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They have a son, namely,
                    [G], who was born in Malaysia on 12 March 1995.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He is now 20 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The matrimonial assets in this case are those
                    arising from the Husband’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Husband first came to Singapore from
                    Malaysia in 1972 when he was about 24 years old. He was accompanied by Mdm
                        [J].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He started off working for a company
                    known as [X] Construction and, about two years later, had risen to become a
                    sub-contractor of the company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He returned to Malaysia with Mdm
                    [J] around 1975 and 1976 but came back to Singapore alone to work after their
                    second son was born in December 1977.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In 1977, the Husband partnered one Mr Tang in
                    the construction business to build factories for foreign companies in
                        Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> At around this time, he became acquainted
                    with the Wife who was then about 23 years old and working as an odd-job labourer
                    in Singapore. They cohabited in rented shophouses before getting married in
                    Malaysia in 1978.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Husband’s business partnership with
                    Mr Tang lasted for about four years before he left to set up his own sole
                    proprietorship known as [Y] Construction Co (“[Y]”) in
                        1981.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> [Y] mainly
                    undertook construction and renovation projects. With time, the business
                    grew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Wife’s evidence was that she and the
                    Husband were merely fellow labourers in the construction business when they met
                    in 1977. She denied knowledge of Mr Tang and stated that [Y] was set up as the
                    couple’s joint effort in 1981. She acknowledged, though, that her
                    participation in the Husband’s construction business started reducing
                    after she became pregnant with their first child, [A], in 1980<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and that her involvement became
                    even less when their second child, [B], was born in 1982.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> She also gave
                    evidence that, following the birth of their youngest child, [D], in 1987, her
                    “days [centred] primarily on the needs of the [children] and the
                        family”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In 30 June 2003, the Husband converted [Y]
                    into a private limited company known as [Z] Construction Pte Ltd
                    (“[Z]”) as [Y] began to take on bigger construction projects and
                    therefore greater liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> According to the Husband, he had
                    appointed himself and the Wife as directors of [Z] as the law then required each
                    company to have two directors. He also claims that, as a full-time housewife by
                    that time, the Wife did not contribute to the management or business of [Z] in
                    any way, financial or otherwise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Wife, however, contends that
                    she took on an active role in [Z] as the children were largely grown up by then.
                    She says that she made visits to various sites where she would supervise
                    workers, that she bought and delivered meals to workers, and that, as not only a
                    co-director of [Z] but also a co-signatory of its bank accounts, she often had
                    to sign cheques and documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     From 2006, [Z] shifted from a construction
                    focus to that of property investment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The practice of the company was to
                    finance the purchase of a property through the payment of an initial capital sum
                    followed on by a bank loan. It would then either sell the property at a higher
                    price after renovating or reconstructing the property, or rent it out and sell
                    it after property prices had increased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> As part of this practice, [D] and
                    [B] would sometimes help to secure bank loans although the Husband would be the
                    one guaranteeing these loans as they were young and did not have substantial
                    income at the time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> [Z] purchased 17 properties from 2006 to
                        2012<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> which were
                    variously registered in the names of the Husband or the Wife and, in some cases,
                    in the names of [D] or [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Circumstances leading to the litigation between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 27 March 2013, the Wife and [D] withdrew a
                    total of $2.75m from their respective joint accounts with the Husband without
                    his knowledge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> They left the matrimonial home on the same
                        day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> According to
                    the Wife, all this was precipitated by a disagreement over the Husband’s
                    intended purchase of a coffeeshop in Woodlands; the Wife and [D] thought that it
                    was an unprofitable venture and tried to dissuade the Husband, but he thought
                    that it was a good idea and proceeded to unilaterally exercise the option to
                        purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In order to protect her own
                    self-interest, the Wife says that she then decided to withdraw the sum of $2.7m
                    from her joint account with the Husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The remaining $50,000 was withdrawn by
                    [D] from his joint account with the Husband. The Husband contends, on his part,
                    that the monies were withdrawn at the instigation of [D] after the Husband had
                    refused his request for $1m to start his own franchise business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Husband commenced Suit No [XY] against the
                    Wife and [D] on 8 April 2013 to recover the sum of $2.75m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In that suit, he also
                    applied for and obtained a <em>Mareva</em> injunction to
                    enjoin the Wife’s and [D]’s bank accounts, whether in their sole
                    names or otherwise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Under the injunction, the Wife and [D]
                    were allowed to withdraw from the enjoined accounts up to $3,000 a week for
                    their living expenses and legal fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The commencement of Suit No [XY] was, in the
                    Wife’s words, “the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s
                        back”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> as it
                    led to her filing for divorce on 10 July 2013 on grounds of the Husband’s
                    unreasonable behaviour. Interim judgment was granted on 2 July

                cross-examine witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the first day of the ancillary hearing, I
                    began by hearing a summons that had been filed just before the hearing and was
                    thus fixed on the same day. Counsel for the Husband, Mr Conrad Campos
                    (“Mr Campos”), sought leave to file two further
                        affidavits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Mr Ferlin Jayatissa (“Mr
                    Jayatissa”) countered with objections or, in the alternative, a request
                    to file affidavits in response. There were also requests for cross-examination
                    from both sides.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General principles on adducing evidence in family
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At this juncture, it would be useful to
                    discuss the special nature of the provision of evidence in family
                cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Court of Appeal’s guidance in
                        <em>Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 465 (“<em>Tan Chin
                        Seng</em>”) in the context of discovery in ordinary civil
                    proceedings provides a good starting point. Relevancy must relate to the type of
                    discovery (<em>ie</em>, general or specific) being sought
                    and this is subject to the overriding principle that such discovery must be
                    “necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for
                    saving costs” (at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In <em>Tan Chin
                    Seng</em>, the Court of Appeal advised that the determination of relevancy
                    “must depend on the issues pleaded in the action” (at [18]). One
                    fundamental difference between family ancillary matters and other kinds of civil
                    proceedings is the lack of pleadings in family ancillary matters to guide
                    discovery and the use of evidence. In family ancillary matters what guides the
                    court’s inquiry are the factors enumerated in ss 112(2) and 114(1) of the
                    Charter which pertain to the division of the matrimonial assets and the award of
                    post-divorce maintenance for the former wife respectively. These factors are
                    numerous and, even then, they are explicitly provided to be non-exhaustive given
                    that both statutory provisions contain the same direction to the court to
                    “have regard to all the circumstances of the case”. <em>Nevertheless</em>, this ought <em>not</em> to be a licence for parties to file multiple rounds of
                    affidavits or to bring in through cross-examination a wide-range of accusations
                    that, on a holistic view of the case, ultimately have only marginal relevance to
                    the issues at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Of relevance is <em>Parra v
                        Parra</em> [2003] 1 FCR 97 (“<em>Parra</em>”), where Thorpe LJ astutely observed as follows at
                    [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The judgment that emerged is a tribute to the judge's exhaustive
                        investigation of a mass of detailed evidence. The result is painstakingly
                        thorough. <b><em>But the outcome of ancillary relief cases
                            depends upon the exercise of a singularly broad judgment that obviates
                            the need for the investigation of minute detail and equally the need to
                            make findings on minor issues in dispute. The judicial task is very
                            different from the task of the judge in the civil justice system whose
                            obligation is to make findings on all issues in dispute relevant to
                            outcome. </em></b><em>The </em><b><em>quasi-inquisitorial role </em></b><em>of the
                            judge in ancillary relief litigation obliges him to investigate issues
                            which he considers relevant to the outcome even if not advanced by
                            either party. Equally he is not bound to adopt a conclusion upon which
                            the parties have agreed. </em><b><em>But this
                            independence must be matched by an obligation to eschew over-elaboration
                            and to endeavour to paint the canvas of his judgment with a broad brush
                            rather than with a fine sable.</em></b> Judgments in this field need
                        to be simple in structure and simply explained. [emphasis added in italics

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In a later English Court of Appeal case of
                        <em>Imerman v Tchenguiz and others</em> [2011] 2 WLR
                    592 at [35], Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury MR (as he then was) explained Thorpe
                    LJ’s comment in <em>Parra</em> on the
                    “quasi-inquisitorial role” of the family judge in ancillary
                    proceedings by referring to the English court’s overriding statutory
                    obligation imposed by s 25(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c 18) (UK) to
                    have regard to all circumstances of the case when deciding on financial
                    ancillary relief applications. This is the English statutory equivalent of our
                    local ss 112(2) and 114(1) of the Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Also instructive to the present discussion is
                    the case of <em>LKW v DD (Ancillary Relief:
                        Guidelines)</em> [2011] HKFLR 106, a decision of the Hong Kong Court
                    of Final Appeal. In that case, Ribeiro PJ (who delivered the leading judgment of
                    the court) described Thorpe LJ’s comment in <em>Parra</em> as “illuminating” at [69]. This was preceded
                    by much the same observation by Ribeiro PJ at [62], stated in the context of
                    setting out guidelines for the conduct of ancillary proceedings as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he court should not countenance any attempt to engage in
                        costly and often futile retrospective investigations of the failed marriage
                        which tend to deplete the parties’ (and the courts’) resources
                        and to increase antagonism and discourage settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The following points may usefully be distilled
                    from the three cases above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     In assessing relevancy and whether
                        more evidence is necessary for disposing fairly of the case or saving costs,
                        the court looks to the factors in ss 112 and 114 of the Charter. Arising
                        from the statutory context, the judge in an ancillary context has a more
                        independent role than that of a judge in ordinary civil proceedings. The
                        duty to ensure that evidence adduced is useful and relevant allows a wider
                        remit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
                        exercising this mandate, the court ought to bear in mind the broad brush
                        approach of the statutory context, and to eschew over-elaboration or trivial
                        issues of minor relevance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     In family proceedings, the costs of proceedings come out
                        of the very assets sought to be divided. Protracted proceedings are
                        detrimental to the financial well-being of the parties and the two separate
                        households which would thereafter require support.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     The court ought also to balance the
                        desirability for additional evidence against the need to avoid a course that
                        further increases conflict unnecessarily among the various relationships
                        within the family. These relationships continue to exist after the specific
                        orders in the lawsuit have been given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In our local context, these objectives of the
                    family court are aided and empowered by Part 3 of the Family Justice Rules 2014
                    (S 813/2014), which is aptly titled “Judge-led approach in resolving
                    family disputes”. Rule 22, in particular, gives a wide discretion to the
                    judge, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In pursuing the object of achieving a
                    “just, expeditious and economical disposal” of the ancillaries,
                    much would depend upon the facts of each case and the matters on which the
                    evidence is sought. Thus, in financial matters, where the evidence may be held
                    closely by one party, the other party may in appropriate cases be given more
                    latitude in seeking discovery, further evidence and cross-examination (see, in
                    this regard, the observations by Dunn J in the English High Court case of
                        <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery)</em>
                    [1978] Fam 181 at 191). Matters relating to indirect contributions, on the other
                    hand, may require a different approach where parties have lived for a long
                    period of time together in the way that they have chosen to do. Seen from this
                    broader perspective of their years together, the cross-examination of witnesses
                    or the filing of a plethora of affidavits over minute events taking place many
                    years ago for the purposes of assessing each party’s indirect contribution
                    is neither necessary for disposing fairly of the proceedings or for saving
                    costs; indeed, often is the case that raking up the past in this way will lead
                    to the real issues being obfuscated, the proceedings turning more protracted,
                    and the parties becoming more embittered. The stage of proceedings is also
                    important. It is best for parties to set out issues in advance and seek to
                    prepare their cases accordingly, rather than to wait until a late stage of
                    proceedings. The practice of delayed and unexpected affidavits and requests
                    increases costs, anxiety and uncertainty for litigants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Requests for further evidence in this case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Coming then to this case, the summons filed by
                    the Husband sought leave for two supplemental affidavits to be filed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first was the Husband’s
                        reply to matters which he said were raised for the first time in the
                        Wife’s second Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 27 May 2015. In
                        this affidavit, the Wife had given evidence of her relationship with the
                        parties’ first and third daughters ([A] and [C]), evidence relating to
                        the company’s work which was relevant to the nature and extent of the
                        Husband’s business, and evidence in the form of property tax
                        statements for the matrimonial home which were relevant to its
                    value.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second
                        was an affidavit by one [T] to rebut certain allegations raised by [B] and
                        [D] in affidavits which they had filed on 3 July and 25 August 2015
                        respectively in connection with the Husband’s intended purchase of a
                        property at Jalan Labu Manis that was eventually aborted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The
                        evidence of [B] and [D] was that they had helped to abort this unwise
                        transaction which the Husband intended to embark on after receiving certain
                        erroneous information from [T]. However, [T]’s response in the
                        supplemental affidavit sought to be filed was that it was in fact the
                        seller’s property agent who had given the Husband the erroneous
                            information.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I gave leave for these affidavits to be filed
                    because they were responses to matters raised for the first time in the
                    Wife’s, [B]’s and [D]’s affidavits. Costs were ordered in the
                    cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Jayatissa, on his part, wanted to file
                    affidavits to reply to the two affidavits. In particular, he sought to file an
                    affidavit from [A] to reply to the Husband’s contentions as to why she
                    left home, and another to rebut [T]’s evidence on the Jalan Labu Manis
                    transaction. Alternatively and in addition, he wanted to cross-examine three
                    categories of witnesses. I disallowed these requests for the reasons that
                    follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Mr Jayatissa wished to
                        cross-examine two of the Husband’s witnesses, [EH] and [CB], who had
                        filed affidavits asserting that the Wife was not the “lady
                        boss” that she contended she was. I did not think this would be add
                        very much to the affidavit evidence, from which it was clear that the
                        Husband was the main mind behind the construction business and that the Wife
                        did play an active role, such as delivering food, helping with stock, or
                        helping when workers were sick. In its Chinese iteration, in any event, the
                        phrase “lady boss” is also commonly used in local parlance to
                        intend “wife of the boss”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, there was a request to cross-examine
                        Mdm [J] arising from an allegation made by the Husband that she had
                        contributed to the pool of matrimonial assets by applying proceeds from a
                        Malaysian coffeeshop, which was purchased by the Husband and ran by her,
                        into the Husband’s business in or about 1986.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Again, this was during
                        the earlier part of the Husband’s business and so only of peripheral
                        relevance to the question of division. Mdm [J] also lives in
                        Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, Mr Jayatissa sought to cross-examine [T] on two distinct areas.
                        The first concerned the circumstances surrounding the aborted Jalan Labu
                        Manis transaction as related in [T]’s supplemental affidavit. The
                        second concerned the Husband’s intended purchase of the Woodlands
                        coffeeshop and the family dispute arising therefrom, [T] had given evidence
                        in an affidavit dated 3 July 2015 that he had acted as the Husband’s
                        real estate agent for the intended purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> I did not think that the evidence given in
                        [T]’s affidavits was crucial to either party’s case: the point
                        that the Wife was merely seeking to make was that the circumstances
                        surrounding the abortion of the Jalan Labu Manis transaction demonstrated
                        that it was a poorly thought out transaction and, in her view, the Woodlands
                        coffeeshop was yet another. Whether [T] was responsible for the advice in
                        relation to Jalan Labu Manis was not a critical point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On Mr Campos’ part, he asked to
                    cross-examine the Wife on: (a) her indirect contribution, in particular, (i) on
                    whether she knew Mdm [J] was married to the Husband at the time of her marriage
                    to the Husband; (ii) the circumstances surrounding [A] leaving the family home
                    when she was about 21 years old;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> (iii) the Wife’s alleged
                    mistreatment of [C];<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and (b)
                    regarding her direct contributions, to show that the Wife would not have been
                    able to save $50,000 because she was an uneducated daily rated construction
                    labourer, taking into account wages applicable in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I did not think that it was necessary for
                    reply affidavits to be filed or for the Wife to be cross-examined on any of
                    these issues to achieve a just and fair disposal of the ancillaries. First, the
                    Husband’s first marriage to Mdm [J] was not disputed. The more pertinent
                    question was the extent of her contribution. Secondly, on the specific facts of
                    this particular case, even if it was not explicit between the parties, it was
                    clear, on the balance of probabilities, that the Wife knew the existence of Mdm
                    [J]. The Husband went to Ipoh, the Wife’s hometown, each Chinese New Year
                    without her or her family for some 35 years. It is not disputed that Mdm
                    [J]’s children stayed with them on visits to Singapore and the children of
                    the two families played together. The Wife’s contention that she thought
                    Mdm [J] was an ex-girlfriend rings somewhat hollow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In respect of the reasons for [A]’s
                    departure from the home, this was detailed in an earlier affidavit by [A] in the
                    divorce proceedings. Parties agreed this affidavit could be referred to as part
                    of the evidence before me instead of lengthy cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> [A]’s evidence was that she
                    left home because of the father’s objections to her Muslim boyfriend, who
                    later became her husband. She and the Wife still maintain a cordial
                    relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for [C]’s circumstances, the
                    Husband’s contention that the Wife mistreated her was raised for the first
                    time in his final affidavit. In my view, it was sufficient to note that [C] was
                    only with the family in Singapore between the ages of seven and 12 years old and
                    that, during this time, her relationship with the Wife was not a happy
                        one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> It is
                    not disputed that the Husband sent [C] to live with Mdm [K] and that [C] married
                    early, leaving Mdm [K]’s home as well. I did not think it would have been
                    useful to dredge up the past by picking apart this aspect of the family
                    relationship some 20 years after their agreed course of conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Lastly, the Wife’s alleged $50,000
                    contribution early in the marriage would have amounted to a very small fraction
                    of the parties’ direct contributions across the 35 year marriage; in any
                    event, Mr Campos also had other evidence on hand, such as the pay of workers in
                    the same time period which, as will be seen (refer to [55] below), is more
                    relevant to the determination of this factual dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In short, in this case, further affidavits or
                    cross-examination was not necessary for the fair disposal of matters; indeed
                    adducing such evidence would in all likelihood have protracted proceedings,
                    created further antagonism, and disproportionately increased costs for the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In dividing the matrimonial assets between the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Regarding the Husband’s expenses in S/N
                    6 of the table above, the original figure proposed by him was in fact
                        $720,596.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>
                    However, I deducted $106,137 as this sum related to gifts made to Mdm
                    [K]’s and Mdm [J]’s families.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I also deducted
                    another $450,000 because these were claimed by the Husband as payments made to
                    sub-contractors with respect to the development of a certain property located in
                    Joo Chiat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> There is no evidence to support this last
                    figure, and I found somewhat unconvincing the Husband’s contention that he
                    did not have the relevant accounts because [D] had charge of the finances of
                    [Z]. At the minimum, withdrawals from the relevant bank accounts ought to have
                    been shown.</p>

                    to the division of assets (at [22]–[27]) which was later summarised in
                        <em>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne
                        Prendergast</em> [2015] SGCA 52 at [17] as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Effect of the prior marriage to Mdm [J]?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It would be appropriate, at this juncture, to
                    discuss the effect of the Husband’s first marriage to Mdm [J] and how
                        <em>ANJ</em> should be applied on the special facts of
                    this case. As I highlighted at the outset of this judgment, the historical
                    context of s 112 was as a mechanism for monogamous marriages. It follows, then,
                    that <em>ANJ</em> makes the same assumption. It is
                    important to consider how s 112 and <em>ANJ</em> may be
                    modified for use in the present circumstances. I begin by setting out the
                    parties’ respective submissions on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1) The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The crux of Mr Jayatissa’s submission
                    for the Wife is that the Husband’s marriage to Mdm [J] is not relevant in
                    the present proceedings, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. On the
                        <em>facts</em>, his position is that since Mdm [J]
                    resided in Malaysia, she was at all times “isolated” from the
                    Husband’s businesses and so neither made any contribution (either directly
                    or indirectly) towards it nor to the matrimonial assets so acquired;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> furthermore, Mr Jayatissa also points
                    out that the bulk of the matrimonial assets were accumulated after [Z] had
                    turned its focus from construction works to property investment but there had
                    been “absolutely no participation from [Mdm [J]] whatsoever” in
                    such investments that were undertaken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Jayatissa further contends that even if he
                    is wrong on the facts, on the <em>law</em>, the plain
                    wording of s 112(2) of the Charter empowers the court to order a division
                    of the matrimonial assets only “between the parties” to the
                    divorce proceedings and no one else.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Therefore,
                    notwithstanding that Mdm [J] may have contributed to the acquisition of the
                    matrimonial assets, the court still could not make an order awarding her a share
                    of the matrimonial assets – that would be beyond the court’s
                    statutory power. Indeed, Mr Jayatissa also argues, by extension, that the court
                    is further precluded from taking into account Mdm [J]’s contribution by
                    subsuming it as a part of (and thereby augmenting) the Husband’s share of
                    the matrimonial assets because that would “effectively” produce
                    the same result as awarding Mdm [J] her quantified share.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Campos, on the other hand, submits on
                    behalf of the Husband that the facts clearly bear out that Mdm [J] has
                    indirectly contributed to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets in a manner
                    that is not inconsiderable. Mr Campos points out that Mdm [J]’s indirect
                    contributions consisted of the following: (a) first, Mdm [J] had taken care of
                    her household since 1973 and almost single-handedly raised two children, thus
                    allowing the Husband to carry on his business in Singapore; (b) second, Mdm [J]
                    had helped the Husband in his construction business in the early years between
                    1972 and 1977 such that, with the earnings that were made, the Husband was able
                    to further his construction business and acquire the matrimonial assets; and (c)
                    third, Mdm [J] applied the sale proceeds of a coffeeshop in Malaysia which she
                    had operated for three years between 1983 and 1986 towards the Husband’s
                    construction business in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As to the Wife’s argument based on s 112
                    of the Charter, Mr Campos accepts that this court could not directly order a
                    division of the matrimonial assets to Mdm [J] as a non-party to these
                    proceedings but, in his submission, the broad direction to the court in s 112(2)
                    to “have regard to all the circumstances of the case” clearly
                    allows the court to take into account the polygamous family arrangement when
                    exercising its power of division between the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> In this regard, Mr Campos advances two possible
                    methods that could be used to account for Mdm [J]’s indirect
                    contributions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first method is Mr Campos’
                        preferred method and what he calls the “qualitative”
                            approach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> This involves putting aside Mdm [J]’s
                        contributions at the start of the inquiry and following the first two steps
                        of the structured <em>ANJ</em> approach (see above at
                        [41]) to arrive at an average ratio which expresses the total direct and
                        indirect contributions of the Husband relative to that of the Wife. Once
                        this is done, Mdm [J]’s contributions can then be worked into the
                        equation at the third stage of the <em>ANJ</em>
                        approach (which is where an adjustment of the average ratio between the
                        parties may be made by taking into account the circumstances of each case).
                        This depends on quantifying Mdm [J]’s contribution in the first place
                        and, according to Mr Campos, this should be done by referencing Mdm
                        [J]’s contribution against the Husband’s contribution from which
                        a second average ratio can be derived. This second ratio (between the
                        Husband and Mdm [J]) should then be “merged” with the first
                        ratio (between the Husband and the Wife) by subtracting equal proportions of
                        Mdm [J]’s quantified share from the Husband’s share and the
                        Wife’s share respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Essentially, this will
                        leave a final ratio expressed as between the Husband and the Wife only, but
                        with Mdm [J]’s share incorporated within.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second method proposed by Mr Campos is what
                        he calls the “quantitative” or “common factor”
                            approach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> To be clear, Mr Campos has included this
                        approach in his written submissions only because it makes <em>theoretical</em> sense but, as a matter of <em>practical application</em> on the facts of this case, he concedes
                        that it is unsuitable and so should <em>not</em> be
                            used.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> With that caveat in mind, Mr Campos
                        elaborates that the “quantitative” approach mirrors the
                        “qualitative” approach up to the point that the court arrives
                        at the two average ratios, <em>viz</em>, one expressed
                        as between the Husband and the Wife (as per the first two steps of the
                            <em>ANJ</em> approach) and the other expressed as
                        between the Husband and Mdm [J]. It is only at the point of
                        “merging” these two ratios that the
                        “quantitative” and “qualitative” approaches
                        diverge. Under the “quantitative” approach, the Husband is
                        essentially used as a focal point for achieving standardisation between two
                        incommensurable objects, <em>viz</em>, the Wife’s
                        contributions and Mdm [J]’s contributions respectively. According to
                        Mr Campos, this is mathematically possible because the Husband is, so to
                        speak, the “common factor” in each marriage; hence the
                        contributions which he made to each marriage provide a convenient basis for
                        comparing the contributions of the Wife against that of Mdm [J]. As a result
                        of this “quantitative” approach, the respective contributions
                        of the Husband, the Wife and Mdm [J] may ultimately be expressed in a ratio
                        consisting of three parts although Mdm [J]’s contribution would, in
                        the final analysis, be incorporated as part of the Husband’s
                        contribution in a ratio expressed only between the Husband and the Wife for
                        the purposes of division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2) Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Turning to analyse the parties’
                    submissions, I do not accept Mr Jayatissa’s argument that Mdm [J] did not
                    contribute anything – not even <em>indirectly</em>
                    – to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets. True it is that Mdm [J]
                    lived in Malaysia and was thereby physically removed from the Husband’s
                    business; however, the whole point of taking into account the <em>indirect</em> contributions of parties is to look beyond a
                    party’s direct involvement in the acquisition of matrimonial assets to
                    acts which might have a less apparent, but no less causal, connection with the
                    acquisition itself. In the present case, there is no dispute that Mdm [J] was
                    solely responsible for the homemaking aspect of the Husband’s marriage
                    with her. These efforts are not insignificant given that Mdm [J]’s
                    marriage with the Husband is a long (indeed, ongoing) one of more than 35 years
                    with two children who were cared for mainly by her while the Husband was in
                    Singapore. There is no doubt that the Husband’s businesses in Singapore
                    generated the income that went into the acquisition of the matrimonial assets;
                    but that he was able to focus his energies on growing those businesses is due in
                    no small part to the fact that Mdm [J] was taking care of the children and the
                    home in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     This leads me squarely, then, into Mr
                    Jayatissa’s further objection that <em>even if</em>
                    it is recognised that Mdm [J] had contributed to the acquisition of the
                    matrimonial assets, the court has no power to divide the matrimonial assets in a
                    way that takes this into account. I agree with Mr Jayatissa’s submission
                    to the extent that the court does not have any power to directly award a
                    non-party a certain share of the pool of matrimonial assets that is subject to
                    the court’s power of division: the court’s power of division is
                    capable of being exercised only as between the parties to the ancillary
                    proceedings and cannot be used to confer a proprietary interest on a non-party
                    notwithstanding that the latter may, as in this case, have contributed to the
                    acquisition of those assets. This is clear both on a plain reading of s 112 of
                    the Charter and as a matter of logic and common sense. After all, the
                    court’s power to divide matrimonial assets is an <em>ancillary</em> power that flows pursuant to a divorce and so the only
                    persons in respect of whom the court can order a division of the matrimonial
                    assets must be limited to the divorcing parties themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     That said, I do not accept Mr
                    Jayatissa’s broader submission that the court should not even take into
                    account Mdm [J]’s contributions as part of the Husband’s share of
                    the matrimonial assets. As Mr Campos submits, correctly in my view, the
                    direction in s 112(2) of the Charter to “have to regard to all the
                    circumstances of the case” is clearly wide enough to permit the court to
                    give proper recognition to the contributions made by Mdm [J] in the acquisition
                    of the matrimonial assets. To shut one’s eyes to the realities of a
                    polygamous marriage such as this would be to see the accumulation of the assets
                    through a narrow, artificial lens in so far as only the contributions of the
                    Husband and the Wife enter into view. At this juncture, it may be asked whether
                    it will in fact be the Husband, then, who benefits unduly from having Mdm
                    [J]’s contributions incorporated as a part of his own. In my view,
                    however, this question overlooks the fact that the family unit between the
                    Husband and Mdm [J] remains intact and, therefore, whatever assets are ordered
                    to be divided to the Husband in these proceedings remains within the pool of
                    matrimonial assets of this valid and subsisting marriage; how the Husband
                    subsequently decides to hold these assets with Mdm [J] <em>inter
                        se</em> is not something that the court is asked to interfere with. I
                    would add that the Husband remains under an obligation to maintain Mdm [J] as
                    his wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Having established that the court can and
                    should take into account Mdm [J]’s contributions as a part of the
                    Husband’s, the focus turns to how her contributions may be <em>quantified</em> relative to the contributions made by the
                    Husband and the Wife respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In my view, the “quantitative”
                    approach as described by Mr Campos (see above at [46(b)]) is not an attractive
                    one: it is quite apparent that the “quantitative” approach is
                    premised on a false equivalent. What it attempts to do, in theory, is to make
                    the indirect contributions of Mdm [J] measureable against that of the Wife by
                    using the Husband’s contributions in both households as a perceived common
                    yardstick or denominator. But this assumes that the Husband had the same (or
                    almost the same) day-to-day influence or presence in each household such as to
                    enable a meaningful comparison to be made between the households. This was not
                    the case. There is nothing to suggest that the Husband had split his time
                    equally between Mdm [J] in Malaysia and the Wife in Singapore; he spent most of
                    his of time in Singapore where his business was and only travelled sporadically
                    to visit Mdm [J]. The strains, demands, obligations and benefits experienced by
                    Mdm [J] and the Wife in each of their respective households therefore varied
                    greatly as a result of the absence or presence of the Husband. To put it in a
                    different way, the Husband’s involvement in each household, far from being
                    a “common” yardstick for comparison, was in fact a factor that
                    significantly differentiated the two such as to make them incomparable.
                    Accordingly, I do not adopt the “quantitative”
                approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The “qualitative” approach
                    preferred by Mr Campos (see above at [46(a)]) is also not without its problems.
                    As presented by Mr Campos, this approach requires the court to first derive two
                    separate average ratios – the first ratio is intended to express the
                    contributions of the Husband against that of the Wife while the second ratio is
                    intended to express his contributions against that of Mdm [J]. Both average
                    ratios are then to be “merged” into a third and final average
                    ratio by incorporating the percentage of Mdm [J]’s contribution (as
                    expressed in the second ratio) into the first ratio between the Wife and the
                    Husband. This “qualitative” approach shares an underlying
                    similarity with that of the earlier “quantitative” approach
                    – in both approaches, there seems to be an implicit assumption that it is
                    permissible to compare the contributions made in one household against the
                    other. But, as I said, the two households are very different. As a result, I do
                    not see how Mdm [J]’s contributions, viewed solely within the confines of
                    her own household and with its own specific circumstances, could be merged into
                    the first ratio between the Husband and the Wife. Furthermore, there is no
                    reason to deduct part of Mdm [J]’s share out of the Wife’s. Mr
                    Campos had two reasons. The first was that the Wife simply took the place of Mdm
                    [J] and enjoyed the life that would have otherwise accrued to Mdm [J]. This
                    assumption that the two women are interchangeable objects is not appropriate.
                    The second rested on his argument that the Wife knew about the first marriage.
                    In effect this argument penalises the Wife for her knowledge, which is also not
                    appropriate: polygamy was the accepted cultural backdrop against which the
                    Husband married the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In my view, the most appropriate way to divide
                    the matrimonial assets in a polygamous marriage such as this is a pragmatic one
                    of simply using the accumulated pool of matrimonial assets as the starting
                    point. The search for a suitable basis of comparison need only extend this far.
                    What the court then has to do is ascertain, in a broad-brush manner, how each of
                    the parties <em>and Mdm [J]</em> had contributed to this
                    accumulated pool of assets, both directly and indirectly, following in this
                    regard the first two stages of the <em>ANJ</em> structure
                    save that the analysis is modified to accommodate three persons instead of two.
                    In this exercise, mathematical precision cannot be attained and it is, in any
                    event, to be eschewed even in the ordinary case of a monogamous divorce (see,
                    for example, <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another
                        appeal</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [81]). Importantly, in this exercise,
                    the court should also not seek to elide or overlook the differences between the
                    households maintained by Mdm [J] and the Wife respectively so that these can be
                    made more comparable with one another; instead, what the court should do is
                    acknowledge the differing circumstances in each household and duly account for
                    them in weighing the contributions of each of the parties. Once the respective
                    direct and indirect contributions of the Husband, the Wife and Mdm [J] have been
                    ascertained, further adjustments may still be made on an overall analysis of the
                    facts of the case in accordance with the third stage of the <em>ANJ</em> approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Direct contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I start with the direct contributions. Here,
                    Mdm [J]’s is negligible. While there is some allegation that the proceeds
                    from a coffeeshop she managed in Malaysia were put into the Singapore business,
                    there was no evidence of any sort. The affidavit of [F], Mdm [J]’s son,
                    suggests the proceeds may have been used to purchase a flat for Mdm [J]’s
                    family and also towards the rental of a hawker stall which Mdm [J] ran until
                    1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As for the Wife, her direct contributions
                    – particularly in respect of the acquisition of the parties’
                    matrimonial home at [Property A] – require some elucidation. When the
                    parties first met, they initially lived in rented premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> In 1982, they
                    purchased their first property in [Property E] for $280,000 (there appears to be
                    a typographical in the Wife’s submissions using $380,000 as she did not
                    dispute the Husband’s use of $280,000 in his affidavit). This property was
                    rented out in order to service the mortgage from 1982 up to 1987, which was when
                    the parties moved in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> In 2000, [Property E] was
                    sold in an <em>en bloc</em> sale for about $1.14m and, with
                    the proceeds obtained, [Property A] was subsequently purchased. The Wife
                    contended that she contributed $50,000 from her savings to the total purchase
                    price. However, the Husband contests this on the basis that she would not have
                    been able to save $50,000, given her modest salary as a labourer then. In this
                    regard, both he and [CB] – who also worked in the construction business in
                    the 1970s – gave evidence that a labourer in those days would be paid at a
                    rate of about $7 per day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> This assertion that the Wife could not have
                    had much savings at the material time is also supported to some extent by her
                    own statement in her affidavit dated 11 April 2014 where she said that she came
                    to Singapore in 1977 with only RM8,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>
                    The Wife also gave evidence that she had stopped working sometime in 1987 after
                    [D]’s birth (see above at [13]). Although this means that she could have
                    accumulated more earnings during the 10 year window between 1977 and 1987, the
                        <em>highest</em> that one could put her total savings
                    at the time [Property A] was purchased is still perhaps only in the region of
                    $25,000 (by using the rate of about $7 a day), which is 9% of [Property
                    A].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Nevertheless, I am mindful of a separate
                    factor which should be weighed in favour of the Wife, which is that between 1982
                    and 1987, the family had lived in rented premises, enabling [Property E] to be
                    rented out. The rental proceeds thus “earned”, so to speak, were
                    used to service the loan. The Wife should benefit equally from the rental
                    proceeds because it was the parties’ joint decision to rent out the
                    premises and the family’s joint sacrifice in living in rented premises
                    that enabled the servicing of the loan. There was no specific figure attributed
                    by the parties to the rental, although the loan which it serviced formed 60% of
                    the total purchase price of [Property E]. Adopting a “rough and ready
                    approximation” (see <em>ANJ</em> at [23], endorsing
                        <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [28]), I added
                    an extra 5% to her share of the direct contributions, representing the five
                    years of rental proceeds which were accumulated. This brings her share of
                    [Property E] up to 14%. Transposing this 14% of [Property E] into 14% of
                    [Property A], this would form a 4% share (rounded to the nearest percentage) of
                    the entire pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I should deal at this juncture with Mr
                    Jayatissa’s arguments premised on two lines of reasoning which arise out
                    of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Tan Bee Giok v Loh
                        Kum Yong</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 605 (“<em>Tan Bee
                        Giok</em>”), a case which dealt with the proceeds of sale of
                    successive properties. In <em>Tan Bee Giok</em> the husband
                    paid solely for the first property and used its sale proceeds to purchase the
                    second property. Notwithstanding that the wife did not make any financial
                    contributions towards the purchase of the first property, the Court of Appeal
                    held that she was entitled to a share of the proceeds generated from its sale by
                    virtue of her indirect contributions in the years leading up to the purchase of
                    the second property; hence this was in fact taken as representing her direct
                    contribution towards the acquisition of the same. The approach in <em>Tan Bee Giok</em> was subsequently followed by the High Court
                    in <em>Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon</em> [2012] 3 SLR 402
                        (“<em>Chan Yuen Boey</em>”) where it was
                    explained at [52] that in such cases where spouses have sold their first home
                    and ploughed those proceeds into their second home, the respective shares to be
                    attributed to the spouses should take into account their indirect contributions
                    – as reflected in the sale proceeds – that had been made up to that
                    point in time. Similar views may be found expressed in the High Court cases of
                        <em>BNH v BNI</em> [2013] SGHC 283 and <em>Goh Cheok Yean v Lum Sai Gek</em> [2014] SGHC
                91.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     These cases ought now to be viewed together
                    with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>AYQ v AYR and
                        another matter</em> [2013] 1 SLR 476 (“<em>AYQ</em>”) (and recently affirmed by the same court in
                        <em>Thery Patrice Roger v Tan Chye Tee</em> [2014] SGCA
                    20 at [24]) that indirect contributions should only be considered at the
                        <em>end</em> of the marriage. This is a significant
                    observation because what it means is that it would be to <em>undervalue</em> a spouse’s indirect contribution towards the
                    acquisition of a successive property if that indirect contribution is treated as
                    being crystallised (prematurely) at the point that the sale proceeds from the
                    previous property are ploughed into the second property. As the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>AYQ</em> explained at [23], indirect contributions
                    are “by their <em>very nature</em> … part of
                    the very warp and woof of the <em>entire</em> marriage and
                    must therefore be reflected consistently throughout each class of assets”
                    [emphasis in original]. The Court of Appeal went on to observe thus (at
                    [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… To hold otherwise would, in our view, be contrary to this
                        approach and would invariably lead to <b>undesirable
                            anomalies</b>. If … the asset concerned was acquired by,
                        for example, a husband very shortly after the marriage, there would,
                            <em>ex hypothesi</em>, be little or no indirect
                        contributions by his wife which could be taken into account when that
                        particular asset is being considered by the court with regard to division
                        between the parties pursuant to s 112. Simply put, the anomaly would be that
                        for matrimonial assets acquired very early on in the marriage, for instance
                        immediately after the marriage, the indirect contributions concerned would
                        more likely than not be given very little weight. In contrast, for
                        matrimonial assets acquired later on during the marriage, the indirect
                        contributions concerned would likely be accorded heftier weight. However,
                        the fallacy in such an approach is the fact that <b>indirect
                            contributions can only be assessed and applied at the
                            </b><b><em>end </em></b><b>of the
                            marriage and, by their very nature</b>, <b><em>relate back and impact the entire marriage to date</em></b><b>. The court’s assessment of a spouse’s indirect
                            contribution should thus be performed with retrospective lenses, looking
                            back and fully appreciating the entire context and circumstances of the
                            marriage. It should not be done in a time-specific manner</b>,
                            <b><em>ie</em></b><b>, assessing the
                            extent of indirect contributions of a spouse as at that specific point
                            in time when a particular matrimonial asset was acquired.</b>
                        Further, this assessment should not be done in a blinkered fashion where the
                        court focuses on each individual class of assets and decides the weightage
                        of a spouse’s indirect contribution as regards that particular asset
                        class, resulting in a situation where varying weights are accorded for
                        indirect contributions in different matrimonial asset classes. This approach
                        would accord with the view of the marital enterprise being a partnership of
                        efforts of both spouses and that, during the course of marriage, the spouses
                        contribute to the betterment of it in ways that they can without consciously
                        accounting with mathematical precision as regards the quantum and type of
                        their respective contributions. … [original emphasis in italics;
                        emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The approach set out in <em>AYQ</em> is clear. In dividing the matrimonial assets of the parties,
                    the court is not to slice up their indirect contributions according to the time
                    of acquisition or the nature of the assets in question. To do so would be to
                    invite “undesirable anomalies” from time to time as the
                    straightforward examples provided by the Court of Appeal amply bear out. This
                    approach also rules out Mr Jayatissa’s argument that the Wife must have
                    contributed to 40% of businesses [Y] and [Z]: her contribution there is also
                    indirect in nature. In my judgment, the indirect contributions of the Wife in
                    this case should not be seen as being converted (so to speak) into direct
                    contributions, in the sense that the indirect contributions are reflected in the
                    form of the sale proceeds from [Property E] which were later ploughed into
                    [Property A]. In accordance with <em>AYQ</em>, her indirect
                    contributions in respect of the acquisition of the entire pool of matrimonial
                    assets should be assessed only at the end of the entire marriage, in order for
                    the court to be able to give her indirect contributions their due
                    recognition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The second line of reasoning which appears in
                        <em>Tan Bee Giok</em> is that it may be possible for
                    one spouse to rely on a presumption of advancement arising from the property in
                    question being held under a joint tenancy (which was how [Property E] was, and
                    [Property A] is, held). However, it is clear that this suggestion was made only
                    as a passing comment by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Bee
                        Giok</em> (at [36]). In any event, it seems to have now been clearly
                    ruled out by the approach of the Court of Appeal in <em>Lock Yeng
                        Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520, where the Court of
                    Appeal made clear (at [40]) that the focus of s 112 of the Charter is to treat
                    all matrimonial assets as community property to be divided in accordance with
                    the principles set out therein, rather than those of conventional property
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     To summarise, the parties’ respective
                    direct contributions may be expressed in the following ratio:</p>
<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="54.2654028436019%"/><col width="45.7345971563981%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top">

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Wife’s contribution to the marriage
                    was mainly indirect. She bore the brunt of raising the children. In this regard,
                    the Husband made various allegations that the Wife had mistreated the children.
                    He said that she forced [A] out of the home when she was 21 years old and
                    mistreated [C]. The various contentions did not add much to the dispute, save
                    for flavour. What is clear is that the parties had four children and the Wife
                    had been the main caregiver of three of these children until adulthood. While
                    she might not have spent as much time bringing up [C], she had still looked
                    after [C] for at least four to five years. For many years, there was no domestic
                    helper to ease the Wife’s burden of taking care of the
                household.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Wife also, at various times, helped in the
                    Husband’s business. This contribution ebbed and flowed with her childcare
                    duties; she contributed more at the beginning of their marriage and after the
                    children had grown up. She had a single share in [Z] and was also a director.
                    She signed cheques as needed and five of the investment properties were held in
                    her name. The funds for the purchase of these properties were also funnelled
                    through various joint accounts with the Husband. While the Husband was the
                    controlling mind of the business, the Wife did help to facilitate the business
                    especially in the latest phase of its growth as a property investment vehicle.
                    The Wife was also the mainstay of [D] and [B]’s participation in the
                    business (and that of [A] until she left home). Both the Husband and Wife are
                    not highly educated. [A], [B] and [D] helped with various aspects of the
                    business such as accounts, logistics and documentation. The fact that the
                    company largely ground to a halt after the Wife and [D] left the home belies the
                    Husband’s contention that his family’s participation was not
                    integral to his business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As for Mdm [J], her indirect contribution in
                    the context of the total pool of assets is less than the Wife’s. On the
                    home front, she had two children. While she may have helped the Husband run a
                    coffeeshop in Malaysia from 1983 to 1986, this was many years ago and it is not
                    clear how this was connected to his Singapore business. Her indirect
                    contribution into the Husband’s ventures was also minimal compared to the
                    assistance rendered by the Wife and her children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As for the Husband, it was clear that he
                    contributed minimally on the homemaking front in respect of both his families.
                    The accounts provided by [A], [B], [D] and [F] were consistent in this regard.
                    The Husband’s role was mainly that of the fee earner in his various
                    relationships. I also bear in mind the fact that, for some 20 years, he had
                    diverted a proportion of his time to Mdm [K] and the son he had with her,
                    [G].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the light of the above, I consider that a
                    just and equitable allocation of the parties’ respective indirect

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Adjustment?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     An average of the two ratios together gives
                    the Wife a 32% share of the pool of matrimonial assets. Should any adjustment be
                    made? In this regard, I considered that the marriage was a long one, thus the
                    Wife’s indirect contribution ought to be given due weight. While the asset
                    pool was not insubstantial, the Wife’s indirect contribution had helped to
                    build that up. I am also mindful that, throughout the duration of the marriage,
                    the Husband would also have, from time to time, made provision out of the pool
                    of assets for Mdm [J] and her children and for Mdm [K] and her son, [G]:
                    [F]’s affidavit and the Husband’s admitted transactions post-July
                    2013 lead to the inference that he is a financially responsible partner and
                    father to his various families. Therefore, in all the circumstances, I find that
                    a slight adjustment ought to be made to put the ratio at 35%, giving the Wife
                    just over a third of the pool of assets. Applying the ratio to the pool of
                    $9,680,891, the amount obtained was $3,388,312 (to the nearest dollar). This sum
                    was, in my judgment, a just and equitable division for the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For completeness, I should mention that Mr
                    Campos seeks to argue that a negative deduction ought to be made because the
                    Wife had withdrawn $2.7m before leaving the matrimonial home. On her part, she
                    explained that she withdrew the money to prevent the Husband dissipating the sum
                    in the proposed transaction involving the Woodlands coffeeshop (see above at
                    [16]). In <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> [2015] 2
                    SLR 195, the Court of Appeal made clear at [27] that in order to ascribe such a
                    negative contribution, the misconduct must fundamentally undermine the
                    co-operative partnership and harm the welfare of the other spouse. The Court of
                    Appeal also emphasised at [25] that the conduct had to be extreme (<em>ie</em>, manifestly serious). In this case, communication
                    between the parties having broken down, the Wife explained that she wanted to
                    stop the Husband from spending her part of their money on the unwise Woodlands
                    venture. The Wife did not dissipate the sum, which is now factored into the
                    asset pool. Given these circumstances, I find that this is not an appropriate
                    case for the use of a negative deduction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Turning to the issue of maintenance, both
                    parties asked for a lump sum order in this case. This is appropriate in
                    accordance with the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <em>AYM v
                        AYL and another appeal</em> [2014] 4 SLR 559 (at [18]) that a lump sum
                    should be allowed whenever feasible to allow for a clean break in the marriage.
                    I shall therefore proceed to determine the appropriate multiplicand and
                    multiplier for arriving at the total lump sum maintenance to be awarded to the
                    Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiplicand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In respect of the multiplicand, the Wife
                    listed her expenses as $8,248 each month. However, I found that $4,500 was
                    reasonable, as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In coming to this amount, I considered the
                    Husband’s ability to support his first wife, Mdm [J], and his youngest son
                    with Mdm [K], [G], whom I note is very near the age of majority. The
                    Husband’s other children are working adults.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I should mention a point on the housing rental
                    raised by Mr Campos. Mr Campos submitted that this ought not to be provided
                    post-divorce because the division of assets would provide her with a sufficient
                    sum for her to buy a new home. However, I did not think my maintenance order
                    ought to make any assumption about how the Wife would invest her money for her
                    longer term welfare.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiplier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Both counsel relied on <em>Chan
                        Yuen Boey</em> in arguing what the appropriate multiplier in this case
                    should be<em>.</em> Mr Jayatissa submitted that applying
                    the criteria used by the High Court in that case, the Wife should be provided
                    for until she is 71; hence a multiplier of 10 years was appropriate. Mr Campos,
                    on the other hand, noted that the High Court in <em>Chan Yuen
                        Boey</em> provided until the wife was 68; hence he suggested that I
                    should use a multiplier of seven years. I find Mr Campos’ approach
                    reasonable in view of the age of the Husband (68) and the sizable proportion of
                    assets awarded to the Wife. I so adopt a multiplier of seven
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Taking the multiplier of seven years and the
                    multiplicand of $4,500 per month together, the total lump sum maintenance comes
                    up to $378,000. Calculated on the basis of an annual effective interest rate of
                    2%, the present value of this lump sum which is to be payable to the Wife is,
                    rounded to the nearest dollar, $353,285.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     No interim maintenance has been paid by the
                    Husband during the litigation. The Wife has been drawing down on the joint bank
                    account, and the agreement is that she will be paying back into the account.
                    Thus, deduction should be made for the interim period of 32 months, beginning
                    from the time that the accounts were enjoined under the <em>Mareva</em> injunction obtained by the Husband in April 2013. This
                    sum amounts to $144,000. Mr Campos suggested a formula to work out the present
                    day sum of the 32 months of maintenance. However, in this case, the entire lump
                    sum should be used because money has been used up over the course of the period
                    and the excess is to be returned to the bank account by the Wife. The total sum
                    of maintenance payable is thus $497,285.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In the result, I make the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife’s share of the
                        matrimonial assets is 35% which, given the size of the pool of assets,
                        amounts to $3,388,312.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     The lump sum to be paid for the Wife’s maintenance
                        is $497,285.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In ascertaining the final sum owing to the
                    Wife, information is needed on the bank accounts and expenditure from those
                    accounts. Counsel are requested to jointly work out how these sums at [76] may
                    best be paid to the Wife. I shall hear counsel in respect of any consequential
                    orders needed and on the question of costs.</p>
