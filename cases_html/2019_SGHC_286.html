The dispute as to liability has been dealt with by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd v OSK Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGHC 104 (“the HC Judgment”) and by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd v OSK Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 372 (“the CA Judgment”). This judgment deals with the dispute as to quantum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Sintalow sued OSK for breach of contract. Sintalow’s case was that the parties’ relationship was governed by what it called a Total Package Agreement (“TPA”) under which Sintalow agreed to give OSK special discounts on the Products in consideration of OSK’s commitment to purchase at least S$5m worth of the Products. The TPA was partly oral and partly written.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 OSK’s case on the other hand was that the parties’ contractual obligations were governed by OSK’s letter dated 21 November 2007 (termed the “Master Contract” by the trial judge).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After a lengthy trial, the trial judge found in favour of Sintalow and held that the Master Contract governed the parties’ relationship. The court also found that OSK had not accepted three separate quotations for the Products based on various bills of quantities for the stated quantities, prices, terms and conditions (“the Products Agreements”). It was further held that OSK did not make representations to Sintalow as to the minimum value of the Products that it would purchase from Sintalow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Judgment was awarded to Sintalow on 25 May 2016 in the following terms (see the HC Judgment at [133]):  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) OSK was to pay Sintalow for all CV couplings that Sintalow delivered to OSK with the customised rubber collars.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Damages would be assessed in respect of:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The order placed by OSK for the additional Duker Hubless products by way of OSK’s letter dated 7 March 2008 and sent by facsimile on 10 March 2008 (“the additional Duker Hubless products”). The additional Duker Hubless products were those underlined in Sintalow’s quotation dated 3 March 2008 and the price and quantities of those underlined products were to be applied in the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The order placed for Duker Hubless cross tees by way of OSK’s letter dated 23 May 2008 (“the Cross Tees Agreement”).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The order placed for customised rubber collars on 8 May 2008 by way of OSK’s letter dated 8 May 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 With regards to the three matters referred to at [5(b)] above, OSK’s three letters dated 7 March 2008, 23 May 2008 and 8 May 2008 and Sintalow’s quotation dated 3 March 2008, were presented in court in volume 1 of the Agreed Bundle of Documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Sintalow appealed against the HC Judgment in Civil Appeal No 83 of 2016 (“the Appeal”) against the following findings made by the trial judge:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the general contractual terms between the parties were contained in the Master Contract and not in the TPA;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that OSK did not make any representations as to the estimated sales amount or that the quantity of products to be purchased from Sintalow would be equivalent to the estimated sales amount;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that Sintalow and OSK did not conclude the three Products Agreements;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that OSK is not liable to Sintalow for the undelivered quantity of Fusiotherm products because Sintalow refused to deliver the same to third parties to whom OSK had sold them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) insofar as damages are to be assessed for the excess supply of Duker Hubless products (“Excess Duker Hubless products”) as described in [120] of the HC Judgment, that the quantities of Duker Hubless pipes that Sintalow had difficulty supplying to OSK must be deducted from the assessment of damages;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) insofar as damages are to be assessed for OSK’s order for cross tees under the Cross Tees Agreement, that those damages are to be assessed on the basis that Sintalow was obliged to give OSK the same discount for the cross tees as it had promised for the other Duker products and that it was not reasonable for Sintalow to place a further order for cross tees when OSK had already indicated it no longer wanted them; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) insofar as Sintalow was entitled to payment for the CV couplings under an 8 May 2008 letter from OSK to Sintalow (“Rubber Sealing Agreement”), that Sintalow was entitled to payment at the quoted price less the 40% discount agreed to in the Master Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 27 April 2017, the Appeal was allowed in part by the Court of Appeal (see the CA Judgment).

Based on the Material List for Valve Orders, Chew asserted that OSK was liable to Sintalow for $788,230.30.

He explained that although a development called the Duo Residences was another big project that Sintalow supplied valves to, Sintalow could not utilise the Excess Valves for the Duo Residences project because it could not supply products of two different ages and colours for installation in the same project as the difference would be obvious and would expose Sintalow to complaints from contractors. It would also be detrimental to Sintalow’s reputation in the industry.

Following negotiations, Sintalow provided Zenith with revised quotations for both Duker Hubless pipes and fittings as well as various types of valves (“the Hospital quotations”). The Hospital quotations encompassed some items which overlapped with the excess products.

Chew then discovered from company searches he conducted that OSK, Deluge and Zenith all shared the same address.

The correct approach that a court should adopt was that where precise evidence was obtainable, the court naturally expected to have it, but where it was not, the court must do the best it could. A plaintiff could not simply make a claim for damages without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it had suffered even if it was otherwise entitled in principle to recover damages.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As indicated at [67] above,  this court’s decision is premised on s 50 of the SOGA being applicable, and, in particular, s 50(3). I am also mindful of Sintalow’s duty to mitigate its loss in accordance with the three rules set out at [76] above. Sintalow cannot recover damages for avoidable losses, but so long as Sintalow has taken reasonable steps to minimise its loss, it cannot be faulted if the consequential loss it suffers is greater than if no mitigating steps had been taken. In addition, echoing the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Robertson</span><span class="font-italic"> Quay </span>set out at [77] above, Sintalow is not required to prove with complete certainty the exact amount of damage that it had suffered. A court has to adopt a flexible approach with regard to the proof of damage. Different occasions might call for different evidence with regard to certainty of proof depending on the circumstances of the case and the nature of the damages claimed. The correct approach that the court should adopt is that where precise evidence is obtainable, the court would expect to have it, but where it is not, the court must do the best it can with the evidence it is presented with. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Tan Soo Leng David, </span>the party in default has no right to be astute in criticising the adequacy of the mitigating steps taken by the innocent party. The touchstone is that of reasonableness in the steps taken by Sintalow to mitigate its loss.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 At the outset, I accept Sintalow’s submission that OSK cannot rely on Sintalow’s inventory lists to support its submission that Sintalow either (i) failed to disclose all the sales it made of the excess products or (ii) it did not have the quantities of the products ordered by OSK. Save for the finding below at [88], I accept Sintalow’s explanation that its inventory lists would only capture the inventory at its warehouse at a particular date/time and that the stocks would fluctuate periodically. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In my view, save as regards the findings at [88] below, OSK cannot allege that Sintalow was unwilling or unable to deliver the products when OSK was the party that failed to take delivery and there were no instances where Sintalow <span class="font-italic">did not deliver</span> what OSK requested (as Mdm Oh admitted, and accepting her testimony that delivery from Sintalow was sometimes late).

</div> Sintalow’s loss of profits figure should be reduced from $330,217.80 to $323,950.98 ($330,217.80 less $6,266.82 (being 694 x $9.03, the profit margin obtained by subtracting the cost price of $28.16 from the contract price of $37.19)).  For the cross tees in item 4, the reduction in profit is based on Sintalow’s cost price of $13.99 for the cross tees.

</div> Therefore, Sintalow’s profit per unit would have been $27.01 (being the contract price of $41.00 less the cost price of $13.99). For 1,000 pieces, Sintalow’s profit would have been $27,010 thereby reducing the profit figure from $42,783.81 to $15,773.81 ($42,783.81 less $27,010).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It would be appropriate at this juncture to address OSK’s submissions challenging the quantum of Sintalow’s claim. In its closing submissions, OSK had relied on Sintalow’s quotation to Zenith to determine the 2012 market price and calculate Sintalow’s loss of profits.

</div> Sintalow had alleged (see [20] above), and OSK disputed, that OSK controlled Zenith. In my view, the fact that OSK was able to obtain a copy of Sintalow’s quotation to Zenith lends credence to Chew’s allegation that OSK was indeed involved to some extent with Zenith’s subcontract for the installation of plumbing and sanitary systems at the Hospital.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As for OSK’s using Sintalow’s quotation dated 14 December 2012 to Zenith as the premise for its submissions, Chew pointed out that its quotation was only meant to kick-start negotiations between the parties.

One of OSK’s arguments concerned Sintalow’s failure to mitigate its loss by selling the excess products to Zenith.

In that case, the High Court awarded damages to the defendant’s failure to take delivery of the total quantities of goods purchased from the plaintiffs under two contracts. The plaintiff disposed of the undelivered balance of the goods by selling them to third parties. The plaintiff claimed and was awarded damages which represented the loss of revenue it suffered under both contracts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In its submissions, OSK contended that Sintalow’s reliance on the above case was misplaced.

OSK cannot blow hot and cold at one and the same time. It had submitted that s 50 of the SOGA applies (see [53] above) and yet sought to argue that there were circumstances in which s 50(3) does not apply. Section 50(2) encapsulates the first rule in <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span> (1854) 9 Ex 341, which principle OSK did not dispute.

There is no reason why Sintalow cannot similarly claim for loss of revenue which represents their gross profits.

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Decision of the High Court (delivered by Lai Siu Chiu SJ):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>SGHC awards $1,180,773.99 in damages to plaintiff in respect of claim for payment for goods which defendant refused to take delivery of.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Background</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">1<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The suit arose from a dispute between the parties over the supply of pipes, valves and other plumbing fittings for installation in the Marina Bay Sands hotel project in 2007. The plaintiff, Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd (“Sintalow”), was the supplier, and the defendant, OSK Engineering Pte Ltd (“OSK”), was the purchaser. The dispute as to liability was dealt with by the High Court in<em> Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd v OSK Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2016] SGHC 104 (“the HC Judgment”) and by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd v OSK Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2017] 2 SLR 372 (“the CA Judgment”). This judgment deals with the dispute as to quantum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><strong>The material facts</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">2<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Sintalow and OSK entered into a Master Contract by which Sintalow would supply OSK with pipes, valves and other plumbing fittings at certain discounted prices. Under the auspices of the arrangement set out in the Master Contract, the parties entered into various products agreements by OSK’s acceptance of Sintalow’s quotations for the various products based on the bills of quantities issued by OSK. The parties entered into several products agreements relating to, amongst other things, the purchase of valves, certain Duker Hubless products, Fusiotherm PPR products, cross tees and rubber sealings. However, OSK eventually did not take delivery of some of the aforementioned items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">3<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Sintalow claimed for, amongst other things, damages in respect of the aforementioned goods which OSK had ordered but refused to take delivery of. Eventually, some of the undelivered product was sold to third parties or scrapped. Sintalow also claimed for a refund of discounts which had been erroneously applied in respect of certain Duker Hubless products sold, as well as for the cost of CV couplings that had been delivered to OSK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">4<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">In its defence, OSK contended, amongst other things, that Sintalow had been unable to supply the quantity of products (<em>eg</em>, the cross tees) ordered, based upon an analysis of Sintalow’s inventory lists. OSK also contended that certain products (<em>eg</em>, the P Traps, S Traps and AFA products) were not locally produced, as required. OSK further argued that it would only be liable to Sintalow for losses if the market price of the products in question was lower than the contract price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">5<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The parties withdrew and agreed several claims in the course of the trial. Sintalow withdrew its claim for storage charges. On its part, OSK withdrew its claim that Sintalow had overcharged it (in consideration of Sintalow’s agreement to pay OSK $10,595.04 in respect of the overcharging). OSK also accepted certain quanta of damages advanced by Sintalow: $6,195.32 in respect of a refund of discounts erroneously applied; that $256,764.71 was the value of products which Sintalow managed to sell to third parties (in mitigation of its loss); and that $35,387.76 was the sum owing to Sintalow in respect of the CV couplings delivered but not paid for by OSK. These agreed matters (“Agreed Matters”) resulted in a sum of $287,752.75 owing to Sintalow by OSK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">6<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">What remained disputed was the quantum of damages in respect of the products which OSK ordered but refused to take delivery of. Sintalow claimed $1,937,592.21 as loss of gross profit (<em>ie</em>, revenue) in respect of these products, and, in the alternative, the sum of $926,298.06 as loss of net profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><strong>The court’s decision</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">7<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Court noted that, <em>prima facie</em>, pursuant to s 50(3) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed), Sintalow would be entitled to loss of profits for OSK’s failure to take delivery of the products it had ordered. The measure of damages would be the difference between the contract sale price to OSK and the cost price at which Sintalow had itself purchased those products from its own suppliers: at <strong>[67]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">8<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Court began by addressing OSK’s general objections to Sintalow’s claim. The Court accepted Sintalow’s submission that certain products (<em>eg</em>, the P Traps and S Traps) could not be re-sold (in mitigation of its loss) due to a subsequent change in regulatory standards which had rendered those products unusable. OSK could have but did not cross-examine Sintalow’s witness on the change in regulatory standards. The Court further rejected OSK’s submission that Sintalow had under-declared the fruits of the mitigating steps taken. The Court also observed that OSK’s contention that Sintalow had failed to produce evidence of the cost price of the products was wholly without merit, as that evidence had been clearly exhibited in certain spreadsheets, the accuracy of which was never challenged at the trial: at <strong>[72]</strong>, <strong>[73]</strong>,<strong> [83] </strong>and <strong>[87]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">9<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Court noted that pursuant to certain findings made by the trial judge (and affirmed by the Court of Appeal) in relation to the proceedings on liability, there had to be a reduction in the damages awarded to Sintalow so as to account for stock (relating to the additional Duker Hubless products and the cross tees which Sintalow could not have delivered (despite the order having been placed): at <strong>[90]</strong> to <strong>[94]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">10<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal;">           </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Court found that the appropriate measure of damages was Sintalow’s loss of profit figures as revised to account for the products which Sintalow could not have delivered. Accordingly, the Court awarded Sintalow damages in respect of the Agreed Matters in the sum of $287,752.75, as well as damages in respect of Sintalow’s loss of profit in the sum of $893,021.24. The Court also awarded interest on both sums, to run from the date of the writ: at <strong>[106]</strong>.</span></p>
