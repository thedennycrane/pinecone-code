<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused, Khor Soon Lee (“the Appellant”), was charged with
                    and convicted of importing 27.86 grams of diamorphine into Singapore (see
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Khor Soon Lee</em> [2009] SGHC
                    291 (“the GD”)). He now appeals against his conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background and facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant, 36 years of age, was charged with the following
                    offence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, Khor Soon Lee, on the 9<sup>th</sup> day of
                        August 2008 at about 2.00 p.m. at the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint,
                        Singapore, did import into Singapore on motorcycle JGF 9461, a
                        controlled drug specified in Class “A” of the First Schedule
                        to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, one packet of
                        granular/powdery substance containing not less than 27.86 grams of
                            <b>diamorphine</b>, without any authorization
                        under the Misuse of Drugs Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you
                        have thereby committed an offence under section 7 and punishable under
                        section 33 of the said Act</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in the original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 9 August 2008, the Appellant entered into Singapore on a motorcycle
                        <em>via</em> the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint
                    (“Woodlands Checkpoint”). As the immigration officer on duty
                    scanned the Appellant’s passport, the computer system indicated that the
                    Appellant ought to be referred to the Arrival Car Secondary Team office. The
                    immigration officer alerted the officers of the Quick Response Team and he
                    stopped the Appellant. A search was conducted and the officers found a black
                    sling bag (“sling bag”) in the front carrier basket of his
                    motorcycle. Therein, under some spare clothes, a further white plastic bag
                    (“the White Outer Plastic Bag”) was found. Inside this White Outer
                    Plastic Bag were two smaller plastic bags: a white plastic bag imprinted with
                    purple flowers (“the Purple Plastic Bag”) and a black plastic bag
                    (the “Black Plastic Bag”), respectively. None of the plastic bags
                    was sealed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Three bundles wrapped in black masking tape were found in the Purple Plastic
                        Bag.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Appellant was questioned as to what these bundles contained, to
                    which he replied in Malay, “<em>barang</em>”
                    (meaning “things”). When questioned further, he said that they
                    were (again, in Malay) “<em>ubat</em>”
                    (meaning “medicine”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> These bundles were unwrapped in the Appellant’s presence and
                    the Appellant was again asked what the revealed substances were. The Appellant
                    then replied that they were “E5” (Erimin), “K”
                    (Ketamine) and “Ecstasy”, respectively. It should be pointed out
                    that these controlled drugs are not the subject of the present charge or appeal.
                    Instead, the Appellant was charged with, and convicted of, what was in the
                    package contained in the Black Plastic Bag. In that particular plastic bag,
                    there was a black bundle also wrapped with black masking tape which contained a
                    packet of white granular/cuboidal substance. After identifying the contents in
                    the three bundles which were in the Purple Plastic Bag, when asked what the
                    substance in this fourth bundle was, the Appellant stated that he did not know
                    what it was. Later, he ventured to say that it could be “Ice”
                    because of its colour.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> It should be noted that this substance was subsequently analysed and
                    was determined to be diamorphine. Returning to the factual background, the
                    Appellant was then placed under arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       While the Appellant acknowledged that all the seized bundles were found in his
                    bag, he claimed that the bundles belonged to one “Tony” (also
                    known as Ong Heng Hor, a Malaysian). The Appellant came to know Tony in a hair
                    salon a year prior to the events and, due to an unpaid consignment of Ice the
                    Appellant took from Tony, ended up owing Tony RM1,600. Unemployed, the Appellant
                    became Tony’s drug courier in July 2008 to pay off his debts. Tony
                    informed the Appellant he was looking to transport Erimin, Ketamine, Ice and
                    Ecstasy into Singapore. For each delivery, the Appellant was paid between RM200
                    to RM300. The delivery that led to the Appellant’s arrest was his sixth
                    job for Tony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       During the consequent investigation, the Appellant revealed and explained the
                    mechanics of the prior deliveries. The Appellant stated that when he received
                    the drugs from Tony, he was sometimes told that the bundles contained
                    “5” (Erimin) and “K” (Ketamine), whilst, at other
                    times, he was not told of their contents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Additionally, Tony also instructed the Appellant not to open the
                    bundles to check their contents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, it was never disputed that the Appellant knew that the
                    bundles contained drugs. The Appellant, however, further asserted that he had
                    asked Tony in July 2008 whether heroin (diamorphine) would be involved in the
                    deliveries as he was afraid of the death penalty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Tony’s response was that he never placed heroin inside the
                    packages that the Appellant was told to carry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span><em>The Prosecution did not challenge the Appellant’s
                        evidence on Tony’s response</em>. The Appellant also added that
                    both of them had always travelled together into Singapore in a taxi or on a
                    motorcycle during their previous deliveries although the Appellant was always
                    the one carrying the drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant then recounted the events leading up to his arrest. On
                    8 August 2008, Tony called the Appellant and told him to look for a
                    motorcycle to make a delivery (which he did). The next day, the Appellant met
                    Tony at a petrol station in Johor Bahru. Tony was seated on a motorcycle
                    himself, and Tony handed him the White Outer Plastic Bag. Apparently, given
                    their previous practice of travelling together (see above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>), this was the first time that the Appellant
                    and Tony travelled in separate vehicles.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This made the Appellant suspicious but he did not question Tony
                    about it as Tony appeared to be in a rush and the Appellant wanted to complete
                    the delivery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The Appellant then took the White Outer Plastic Bag and kept it in
                    his sling bag without checking its contents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> No questions were asked.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The two men then rode their respective motorcycles to the Johor
                    Bahru Check Point separately and they agreed to meet at the Kranji Mass Rapid
                    Transit station (“Kranji MRT”) once they cleared the Singapore
                    customs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       That rendezvous at Kranji MRT naturally failed to materialise when the
                    Appellant was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint. Nevertheless, after the
                    Appellant’s arrest, he cooperated with the authorities to lure Tony out,
                    and Tony was arrested at Kranji MRT a few hours later. As things eventually
                    turned out, the Prosecution took the view that there was a lack of evidence
                    against Tony and, when both sets of counsel attended a Pre-Trial Conference
                    (“PTC”) on 26 May 2009, the decision to apply for a discharge
                    not amounting to an acquittal (“DNAQ”) was made known to the
                    court. The next day, 27 May 2009, Tony was granted a DNAQ and was
                    repatriated to Malaysia (approximately nine months after being charged).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After hearing the appeal, we directed counsel to file further submissions to
                    address us on the issue of what could have been done to secure Tony’s
                    attendance as a witness at the trial of the Appellant and the effect of
                    Tony’s absence at the trial. Both parties have helpfully clarified the
                    chronology of events leading to the granting of Tony’s DNAQ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> On the record, there had been no objection to, or application to
                    delay, the DNAQ; nor was there any other application by the Appellant’s
                    then counsel to secure Tony as a witness for the Appellant at the PTC of
                    26 May 2009. To be fair to both sets of counsel, it appeared that no one at
                    that stage thought that Tony was a going to be a material witness for either
                    party. From the Appellant’s own Further Written Submissions dated
                    21 December 2010, the first time that the Appellant’s counsel had
                    made an application pertaining to Tony was approximately two weeks after the PTC
                    of 26 May 2009, on 8 June 2009, when the then Appellant’s
                    counsel requested for an inspection of Tony’s passport. When that request
                    could not be accommodated, the then Appellant’s counsel responded on
                    19 June 2009 to say that his client’s case was, as a result,
                    prejudiced. It was only on 24 June 2009 that the position pertaining to
                    Tony changed and it was thought that Tony would be required as a witness for the
                    Appellant. The Respondent tried to re-call Tony as a witness and sought the help
                    of the Investigation Officer (“IO”) in this matter to locate Tony.
                    Tony was finally contacted over the phone in Malaysia but (not surprisingly) he
                    dismissed the idea of returning to Singapore to testify at the Appellant’s
                    trial. Several attempts were subsequently made to contact Tony but Tony could no
                    longer be reached over the phone and his whereabouts remain unknown
                    since.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The trial judge (“the Judge”) was of the view that the Appellant
                    was presumed to know the nature of the controlled drug (<em>ie</em>, diamorphine) that he possessed by virtue of
                    section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”), and held that the Appellant was unable to rebut the
                    presumption. The Judge reasoned that the Appellant could not rely on his belief
                    that the bundles contained the usual drugs (<em>viz</em>,
                    Erimin, Ketamine and Ecstasy) he had been carrying into Singapore for Tony since
                    the accused bore the risk that Tony could go back on his word. Additionally,
                    even if the Appellant opened the bundles and was later given a false answer by
                    Tony, the Appellant also bore the risk that the answer given to him would turn
                    out to be false. In any event, the Judge found the accused was conscious of the
                    fact that he was in possession of controlled drugs and there was ample
                    opportunity for him to take a look inside the unsealed White Outer Plastic Bag
                    at the four bundles in the Purple Plastic Bag and the Black Plastic Bag. No
                    inspection was done, and in the circumstances, the Judge found the Appellant to
                    be wilfully blind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Further, the Judge observed that the delivery on 9 August 2008 was
                    peculiar in itself since Tony had suddenly decided to travel on his own instead
                    of travelling with the accused as had always been the case on numerous previous
                    occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Judge also did not find any merit in counsel for the Appellant’s
                    submission that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for
                    not producing Tony at trial. The Prosecution had decided against proceeding
                    against Tony and there was consequently no reason to keep Tony in remand in
                    Singapore. The Judge further held that, in any event, had Tony testified, his
                    testimony would not have altered his findings on the Appellant’s knowledge
                    and culpability (see the GD at [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the present appeal, we note that the Appellant is not disputing that he was
                    carrying a controlled drug. Rather, what he took issue with both in the court
                    below and on appeal was <em>his knowledge</em> pertaining
                    to the nature of the controlled drug he was carrying. Put simply, whilst he knew
                    he was carrying and importing controlled drugs into Singapore, he submitted that
                    he had no knowledge that one of the plastic bags contained diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The relevant provision is s 18 of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled
                            drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>18</b>. —(1) Any person who is proved
                        to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by
                            proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled
                            drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the
                            rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be
                            in the possession of each and all of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The main issue that was raised before this court in the present appeal is
                    whether the Appellant has rebutted, on a balance of probabilities, the
                    presumption of knowledge contained in s 18(2) of the Act, bearing in mind
                    the fact that mere assertions of ignorance alone may be insufficient to rebut
                    the presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We pause, however, to also observe, parenthetically, that it is, of course,
                    open to the Prosecution to prove that the accused had actual knowledge on the
                    facts of the case itself, in which case it would then be unnecessary to rely on
                    the presumptions under (in this instance) s 18 of the Act (see <em>Tan Kiam Peng v PP</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1
                        (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>”) at [171]). However, especially in the nature of
                        <em>this</em> offence itself, proving the mental
                    element of actual knowledge would often be an extremely difficult task; hence,
                    the need for the presumptions that have just been referred to. That having been
                    said, we should think that, if the accused is able to rebut, on a balance of
                    probabilities, the relevant presumption(s), it would follow that the Prosecution
                    would <em>not</em> be able to prove that the accused had
                    actual knowledge in the case concerned. Conversely, if there is clear evidence
                    that the accused had actual knowledge on the facts of the case, it would follow
                    that the accused would <em>not</em> be able to rebut, on a
                    balance of probabilities, the relevant presumption(s). Indeed, the Prosecution
                    might not – as alluded to at the outset of the present paragraph –
                    even need to rely on the presumption(s) in order to establish knowledge on the
                    part of the accused. It is important to emphasise that much would, of course,
                    turn on the precise factual matrix concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present appeal, it is clear that no issue of actual knowledge <em>per se</em> has arisen. Indeed, as this court noted in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> (at [106]), “the practical reality [is]
                    that a finding of actual knowledge is likely to be rare”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the court below, in the process of finding that the Appellant had failed to
                    rebut the presumption of knowledge, the Judge observed that the
                    Appellant’s failure to make inquiries was tantamount to being wilfully
                    blind (see the GD at [30]). The second
                    related issue before this court is therefore whether the Appellant has proved,
                    on a balance of probabilities, that he was not wilfully blind in the
                    circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The issues faced by this court are first and foremost a determination of fact,
                    and, given the capital nature of the offence, necessitates a rigorous analysis
                    of the evidence in the Record of Proceedings. The relevant principles pertaining
                    to wilful blindness, as set out by this court in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> (at [137]-[141]), are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">137    
              <em>First</em>, although the statutory contexts
                            under [<em>Warner v Metropolitan Police
                                Commissioner</em> [1969] 2 AC 256
                            (“Warner”)] and under the Act are different, the
                            explication by the House of Lords in <em>Warner</em> of the <em>general</em>
                            concept of <em>possession</em> (which was adopted
                            locally in [<em>Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979-1980] SLR(R)
                                311</em>] and a myriad of other Singapore decisions) is
                            helpful and, in fact, supports the first interpretation of s 18(2) of
                            the Act to the effect that knowledge in s 18(2) is a reference to
                            knowledge that the drug concerned is a controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">138    
              <em>Secondly</em>, there is a second
                            interpretation which states that the reference to knowledge in
                            s 18(2) is <em>not only</em> to a controlled
                            drug <em>but also</em> to the <em>specific drug</em> which it turns out the accused is in
                            possession of. The strongest arguments for this second interpretation
                            are as follows. First, there is the literal language of that provision.
                            Secondly, because of the possibility of harsh punishments (including the
                            death penalty) being imposed, even if it is argued that an ambiguity in
                            the statutory language exists, the fact of such ambiguity suggests that
                            the benefit of the doubt ought to be given to the accused. However,
                            although the second interpretation appears to us to be more persuasive,
                            we express no conclusive view in this particular appeal simply because
                            this particular issue was not argued fully before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">139    
              <em>Thirdly</em>, whilst the concept of knowledge
                            in s 18(2) of the Act entails <em>actual</em>
                            knowledge, the doctrine of <em>wilful
                                blindness</em> should also be emphasised and is also included
                            within the concept of knowledge in s 18(2) simply because wilful
                            blindness is the <em>legal equivalent</em> of
                                <em>actual</em> knowledge. However, the
                            reference, particularly in the court below, to the various <em>theoretical</em> degrees of knowledge is, in our
                            view, unhelpful and might even have an <em>adverse</em> impact in the sphere of <em>practical</em> application. This brings us to a closely
                            related point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    In so far as the doctrine of <em>wilful
                                blindness</em> is concerned, the evidence required to be
                            adduced by the accused to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the
                            nature of the controlled drug under s 18(2) of the Act is by no
                            means a mere formality, even though the standard required is the civil
                            standard (of proof on a balance of probabilities). Such an approach is
                            not only just and fair but is also consistent with the underlying policy
                            of the Act itself. However, we have also demonstrated that in situations
                            where the accused truly does not know the nature of the controlled drug
                            in his or her possession, it is clear that the accused <em>will</em> be able to rebut the presumption of
                            knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug under s 18(2) on a
                            balance of probabilities. This will be the situation where, for example,
                            the controlled drugs in question were slipped into a package the accused
                            was carrying without his or her knowledge (see also above at [35] and
                            [132]), or where the accused is otherwise devoid of actual knowledge and
                            finds himself or herself in a situation in which the facts and
                            circumstances do <em>not</em> give rise to that
                            level of suspicion that would entail further investigation lest a
                            finding of wilful blindness results. All this, again, is consistent with
                            the underlying policy of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">141    
              <em>Fourthly</em>, therefore (and still on the
                            issue of knowledge in s 18(2) of the Act), whilst <em>general</em> regard ought to be had to the concept of
                                <em>actual</em> knowledge (<em>including</em> the doctrine of <em>wilful
                                blindness</em>), the <em>main</em> focus
                            ought always to be on the <em>specific or particular
                                factual matrix</em> in the case at hand. The principal
                            difficulty lies in the attempt to divine a universal legal norm to
                                <em>comprehensively</em> govern what is
                            essentially and, at bottom, a <em>factual</em>
                            inquiry. This is not to state that, in certain areas of the law, such an
                            approach is inappropriate. However, in a situation such as the present,
                            such an approach is less than satisfactory simply because the <em>focus</em> is <em>primarily factual
                                and (more importantly) the permutations of the factual matrices are
                                too numerous, varied and complex</em> to admit of a perfect
                            legal solution. It is, of course, axiomatic that a universal legal norm
                                <em>is</em> necessary. What, however, should be
                            eschewed is the attempt to formulate a universal legal norm that
                            purports to <em>comprehensively</em> govern the
                            various (and variegated) fact situations. This leads, as we shall see,
                            to <em>excessive refinements and fine distinctions that
                                hinder (rather than facilitate) the task at hand</em>. Indeed,
                            that s 18(2) of the Act is formulated at a fairly high level of
                            generality is an acknowledgment of the danger just mentioned. In the
                            circumstances, the <em>universal</em> norm with
                            respect to knowledge in s 18(2) is that it would encompass
                                <em>actual</em> knowledge in both its purest
                            form <em>as well as</em> in the form of <em>wilful blindness</em> and would apply to the
                                <em>specific factual matrix</em> concerned -
                            with the focus being, in the nature of things, on the <em>latter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Importantly, particularly for the purposes of this appeal, it bears
                    emphasising that negligence or recklessness does <em>not</em> amount to wilful blindness (see <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> at [129]). It is a
                    high threshold to be met and a finding of wilful blindness ought <em>not</em> to be made <em>unless</em>
                    there is a strong <em>factual</em> basis for doing
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Judge had found in the court below that there had been wilful blindness on
                    the part of the Appellant. Before this court, counsel for the Appellant,
                    Mr Rupert Seah, argued that there had been no wilful blindness on the part
                    of the Appellant for the following (related) reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant had only ever assisted in importing Erimin, Ketamine, Ice
                        and Ecstasy (“the Controlled Drugs”). This was clear from his
                        own Statements made. It is important to note that counsel for the
                        Prosecution, Mr Aedit Abdullah, confirmed that no evidence had been led
                        in the court below to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant had been careful to confirm with Tony that the package of
                        drugs in the present case contained – as before (see above at
                            <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>) – only the Controlled
                        Drugs and <em>not</em> diamorphine. It is significant
                        to note that this package contained <em>both</em> the
                        Controlled Drugs <em>and</em> heroin, the latter of
                        which constituted the (capital) charge that is the subject of the present
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Appellant had a close and personal relationship with Tony generally
                        and therefore <em>trusted</em> him. This was especially
                        (but not confined to) the case in relation to the confirmation he had sought
                        at (b) above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     The fact that Tony had been unavailable as a witness had prejudiced the
                        Appellant’s defence generally (including the submission that he (the
                        Appellant) had not been wilfully blind to the heroin in the package).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The arguments set out in the preceding paragraph are not only related but must
                    also, in our view, be considered as <em>a whole</em>,
                    having particular regard to the <em>particular facts as well as
                        the context</em> in which such facts occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this regard, the fact that the Appellant had assisted in transporting
                        <em>only</em> Controlled Drugs on a <em>significant number</em> of occasions in <em>the
                        past</em> does weigh in favour of the Appellant. <em>Importantly, as we have noted above, this particular factual aspect of the
                        Appellant’s account was uncontroverted by the Prosecution in the court
                        below as well as on appeal</em>. The delivery that led to his arrest
                    was at least the Appellant’s sixth for Tony<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and, in the previous deliveries, the Appellant averred that he was
                    told that the drugs intended to be shipped were only the Controlled
                        Drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Indeed, when the Appellant began assisting Tony, Tony informed him
                    that he (Tony) wanted to bring in only the Controlled Drugs into Singapore (and,
                    where applicable, in quantities that did not attract the death
                        penalty).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> No mention of diamorphine was made. Additionally, it is also vital
                    to emphasise that the Appellant sought assurances from Tony that the deliveries
                    would not involve diamorphine. The Appellant claimed that he wanted these
                    assurances since he was afraid of the death penalty (see also above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> and it was only logical that, because these assurances were
                    subsequently given, that the Appellant agreed to proceed with the deliveries.
                    Tony assured the Appellant that he did not place diamorphine in the packages
                    that the Appellant carried. <em>Again, the Appellant’s
                        account here was uncontroverted</em>. Put simply, a <em>consistent pattern</em> of assisting in importing Controlled Drugs
                    that did <em>not</em> carry the sanction of <em>capital punishment</em> (for those controlled drugs that did,
                    the quantity imported was not high enough to attract capital punishment) had in
                    fact been established by the Appellant. To the detriment of the Appellant, the
                    transaction that is the subject matter in the <em>present
                        appeal</em> was one that <em>deviated from</em>
                    this pattern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     That having been established, it is, however, <em>also</em> necessary to consider whether the Appellant ought to have
                    nevertheless <em>checked</em> the package on this
                    particular occasion. In particular, in not so checking, had the Appellant been
                        <em>wilfully blind</em> to the diamorphine contained in
                    the package (which was found in the Black Plastic Bag)? In our view, and
                    notwithstanding the (unfortunate) complacency exhibited on the part of the
                    Appellant, it was – in light of <em>the consistent pattern
                        and the relationship</em> that had hitherto existed between himself
                    and Tony – understandable why he had not checked the package. It would, of
                    course, have been ideal if he had. However, the Appellant had no reason, in
                    light of the <em>specific facts and (especially) consistent
                        pattern that had been established</em> (which we will explain below),
                    to <em>strongly suspect</em> that the package contained
                        <em>diamorphine</em>. The same could also be said about
                    the fact that the Appellant and Tony travelled separately on their own instead
                    of travelling together as had been the case on numerous previous occasions. A
                    mere suspicion it could have been, but it was far from being a distinct enough
                    peculiarity (in and of itself) to raise a strong suspicion. <em>At the very least, the suspicion must bear a reasonable connection to the
                        specific drug at issue</em>. In both instances, his failure to check
                    the contents of the package would, at best, constitute only <em>negligence or recklessness</em>. As we have indicated above at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>, these instances are insufficient
                    to amount to wilful blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It will be recalled that the Appellant had submitted that he had a close and
                    personal relationship with Tony and that he (the Appellant) had therefore
                        <em>trusted</em> him (see above at <a href="#p1_21-p2_c">[21(c)]</a>). If the Appellant could make good
                    this submission, this would buttress his <em>uncontroverted</em> claim that he had thought that he was only
                    carrying the Controlled Drugs, having regard to the fact that he had been
                    carrying only the Controlled Drugs during the previous occasions he had
                    participated in. That measure of trust would lend further basis to his <em>uncontroverted</em> claim that Tony did not deal in
                    diamorphine, and would also provide a sufficiently cogent reason why he adhered
                    to Tony’s instructions not to open up the bundles. It is also important to
                    note that, without having had the benefit of Tony’s testimony, it would
                    only be fair to the Appellant to assume that what he (the Appellant) stated with
                    regard to his relationship with Tony, was true. With the limited evidence on
                    record, all we can conclude at this moment is that Tony was indeed involved in
                    the transaction as his deoxyribonucleic acid (commonly known as
                    “DNA”) evidence was found on the package.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This, we consider, to be a crucial fact. It objectively corroborates
                    the Appellant’s assertion that Tony had a significant role in the
                    transaction. Further, Tony was in fact subsequently apprehended on the same day
                    as the Appellant’s arrest, <em>with</em> the
                    Appellant’s cooperation. In our view, whilst we ought not – and,
                    indeed, cannot – make any observations with regard to Tony’s guilt
                    as such, the very fact of Tony’s existence and his seeming involvement
                    corroborated with the Appellant’s version of the events in general and,
                    more importantly, the <em>nature</em> of his relationship
                    with Tony in particular. In his evidence, the Appellant testified that he met
                    Tony in 2007 at a hair salon and, thereafter, met him once or twice a week.
                    Usually, the pair would meet at the hair salon every week and they would have a
                    “chit chat” with each other. On several occasions, Tony would take
                    him to the discotheque, and, on other occasions, they would go out for food.
                    When the Appellant lost his job sometime in April 2008, it was Tony who offered
                    him an opportunity to sell on drugs (that Tony supplied) to one of his friends.
                    That friend failed to pay for the consignment and the Appellant, as a result,
                    owed Tony money. The Appellant avoided Tony at first but unfortunately chanced
                    upon each other in a discotheque subsequently. There, Tony reminded the
                    Appellant of the debt and, soon after, offered the Appellant several jobs (to
                    courier controlled drugs) which could assist the Appellant’s repayment of
                    the money owed to him (Tony). It was in this context that the Appellant agreed
                    to deliver the Controlled Drugs for Tony, and also believed Tony when he said
                    that he did not deal with heroin. In our view, it could further be the case
                    that, because Tony consistently provided him with the Controlled Drugs as
                    claimed, there was no real reason for the Appellant to be suspicious and
                    disbelieve Tony. As far as first impressions go, it would appear that the
                    Appellant and Tony shared a friendly relationship, and giving the benefit of the
                    doubt to the Appellant, that friendship formed a sufficient basis for his
                    assertion that the Appellant trusted Tony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, as already noted, Tony was released pursuant to a DNAQ. We should
                    observe, at the outset, that we do not even hint at any impropriety in the
                    procedure adopted by the Prosecution with regard to Tony. However, whilst the
                    Prosecution might have had valid reasons for releasing Tony, the fact remains
                    that Tony might have furnished valuable evidence that would have buttressed the
                    Appellant’s defence, one possible aspect of which was the relationship of
                    trust between the Appellant and Tony referred to above. In this regard, it is in
                    our view unsafe to assume in the circumstances, without more, that any evidence
                    furnished by Tony would not have altered the Judge’s findings with regard
                    to the Appellant’s knowledge and culpability (<em>contra</em> the GD at [32]).
                    The central difficulty facing this court in this particular regard is that we
                    obviously do not know what precisely Tony’s testimony would have been had
                    he been called as a witness. However, given this situation, we are of the view
                    that, at the very least, the Appellant ought <em>not</em>
                    to be prejudiced by the absence of Tony’s testimony as a result of the
                    Prosecution’s decision to apply for a DNAQ. Notably, this is unlike some
                    other situations where some, but not all, accomplices are arrested while the
                    rest evaded arrest and could not subsequently be called (if applicable) to give
                    evidence. In our view, therefore, given the exceptional circumstances of this
                    case, we found that the benefit of the doubt ought to be given to the Appellant
                    and that necessarily means that this court has to assume that Tony’s
                    evidence could have assisted the Appellant’s defence insofar as the
                    element of knowledge was concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Returning to the issue at hand, we have to do the best we can, based on the
                    available evidence which has been set out above. To <em>summarise</em>, the Appellant has adduced evidence to the effect that
                    he had hitherto always been dealing in the Controlled Drugs, which (in turn)
                    constitute evidence of a <em>consistent pattern of
                        conduct</em> that was <em>not contradicted by the
                        Prosecution in the court below</em>. He had also argued that he had
                    taken precautions throughout not to deal in drugs (such as diamorphine) which
                    would have resulted in charges carrying the death penalty. In the context of the
                    present appeal, he had confirmed with Tony that the package did not contain
                    diamorphine and had trusted his answer that it did not in light of their close
                    and personal relationship. We pause to note – parenthetically – that
                    the Appellant must have simultaneously taken into account his experience on the
                    previous occasions (when he had, as we have just noted, dealt only in the
                    Controlled Drugs). As mentioned above, we must – in the absence of any
                    actual testimony by Tony to the contrary – assume that any testimony
                    furnished by Tony would have buttressed the Appellant’s defence. The Judge
                    observed that the Appellant did not look at the items contained in the plastic
                    bags and took the risk that Tony “could one day play him out” (see
                    the GD at [29]). Whilst this view may be
                    of general relevance, we emphasise once again that the circumstances of this
                    case are exceptional and that the Judge’s view should, with respect, have
                    been mitigated by the cumulative effect of the Appellant’s <em>uncontroverted</em> evidence as to the <em>consistent pattern of conduct and his trust in Tony</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the circumstances, we would respectfully differ from the finding of the
                    Judge to the effect that the Appellant had been wilfully blind to the fact that
                    the package contained diamorphine. Given the <em>particular
                        factual matrix</em> set out above, we are of the view that the
                    Appellant was, at most, either negligent or reckless in not checking the
                    package, but <em>not</em> wilfully blind. Given his
                    relationship with Tony and (especially) the previous occasions when he had
                    assisted in importing ice (which were not insignificant in number), there was
                        <em>an absence</em> of a <em>strong
                        suspicion</em> to which the Appellant had turned a blind eye.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As a result of our finding above, and given the <em>particular
                        factual matrix</em> set out above, it would also follow that the
                    Appellant has succeeded in rebutting, on a balance of probabilities, the
                    presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act. It bears emphasising
                    that each case will, of course, depend on its own precise facts. The facts of
                    the present appeal, it might be observed, are rather unusual: in particular, the
                    consistent pattern of conduct referred to above (which centred on dealing in
                    drugs which did <em>not</em> involve the death penalty) was
                    admitted by the Prosecution, and, further, the testimony of a significant
                    witness (Tony) was not available (for which we have therefore assumed that such
                    testimony, if given, would have buttressed the Appellant’s case). In the
                    circumstances, a strong cautionary note ought to be sounded. Given the finely
                    balanced set of facts in the present appeal, nothing in this case sets a
                    precedent for future cases (which ought, in any event, to turn on their own
                    particular facts). Still less will future courts countenance accused persons
                    seeking to “manufacture defences” in order to effect a similar
                    fact pattern.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal on the charge as it stands.
                    We would like to note the exemplary manner in which the Prosecution and Defence
                    had conducted their respective cases in the present appeal and would like to
                    commend them accordingly. In particular, the Prosecution conducted its case in
                    the spirit of its overall mission, which is encapsulated in the following
                    observation of this court in <em>Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2010] 1 SLR 966 (at [103]) that “the Prosecution ... [is
                    the] guardian of the people’s rights, <em>including those
                        of the accused</em>” (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Pending submissions from the Prosecution on whether we ought to, <em>inter alia</em>, amend the charge, we will adjourn the
                    matter. The Prosecution has 21 days to let us have its submissions on what
                    courses of action are open to us on the established facts. Counsel for the
                    Appellant will have 21 days thereafter to respond. We will then hear the
                    parties on the issues that have arisen. Until then, the Appellant will continue
                    to be in custody.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We have already noted that it was unfortunate that Tony had been released
                    prior to the trial of the Appellant. However, there appears to be no hard and
                    fast rule that will ensure that such a difficulty does not arise in future
                    cases. All we can state, at the present time, is that, where there are at least
                    two co-accused who have been charged in relation to the same transaction, the
                    Prosecution should endeavour, if (as was the case here with regard to Tony) it
                    proposes to release one of the co-accused, to inform counsel for the other
                    co-accused as expeditiously as possible. Likewise, counsel for the <em>other</em> co-accused should also act with equal expedition
                    in determining whether the evidence of the co-accused (to be released) is
                    necessary for his or her client’s defence. If deemed necessary, counsel
                    ought to make the necessary applications to secure the co-accused’s
                    attendance at the trial of his or her client.</p>
