The Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant as a painter. The Defendant received a complaint that there was some debris on the roof of the 1st storey unit. The Plaintiff went down to the roof of the 1st storey unit to clear the debris, and fell down from the roof at the height of 3.5 meters to the ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On that day, the Plaintiff sustained fractures on his right ankle as well as a fractured lower back. The injuries to the Plaintiff’s right ankle were such that he had to undergo a surgical operation. After the surgery, the ankle fracture was complicated by infection of the bone, i.e. osteomyelitis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff brought an action for damages against the Defendant. Interlocutory judgement by consent was subsequently entered on 7 December 2016 for 90% of the overall damages to be assessed to be paid by the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Undisputed items of damage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 There was agreement between the parties in their written closing submissions for the award of medical expenses at <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$9,934.23</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Disputed items of damage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The following are the heads of claim in dispute:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) General Damages:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pain and suffering;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Future medical treatments and expenses;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Future transport expenses;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Loss of future earnings; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Loss of earning capacity.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Special Damages:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pre-trial loss of earnings; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Transport expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I will now go through each of the heads of damages in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pain and suffering</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Plaintiff claimed: (a) $35,000 for the injuries to his right ankle; (b) $35,000 for the injuries to his lower back; (c) $5,000 for the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis of his right ankle; (d) $10,000 for the multiple scars on his right ankle; and (e) $2,000 for muscle wastage in his right thigh and calf muscle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Defendant submitted an award should be made as follows: (a) $25,000 for the injuries to the right ankle; (b) $20,000 for the injuries to the lower back; (c) $3,000 for the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the right ankle; and (d) $3,000 for the multiple scars on the right ankle. The Defendant’s position is that no separate award should be made for muscle wastage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Right ankle fracture complicated by infection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Plaintiff sustained comminuted intra-articular fractures (Sanders Type IV) of the right calcaneal complicated by osteomyelitis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 5 June 2015, the Plaintiff underwent open reduction and internal fixation for his right calcaneal fracture. He was discharged four days later on 9 June 2015 with prescription, appointments for physiotherapy and further reviews. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiff’s case is that following the surgery, the foot’s healing process was painful and complicated. The pain on the Plaintiff’s right foot was unbearable and he had fever, which made him visit the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) on 21 October 2015. The Plaintiff was admitted on the same day after being told that he had developed osteomyelitis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 22 October 2015, the Plaintiff underwent a second surgery to remove his right calcaneum implant and debridement as well as excision of sinus tracts. Despite taking out the implants, the Plaintiff developed an abscess collection during his stay in the hospital on the lateral malleolus. He underwent further abscess wound debridement and drainage on 14 November 2015. The Plaintiff was discharged on 26 November 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Whilst the fractured heel has completely healed, there are some resulting disabilities including restricted range of right ankle/foot motion in all directions of movement. The Plaintiff suffers from pain on walking on uneven ground. This was uncontroversial. The Plaintiff’s medical expert report from Dr Lee Soon Tai (“Dr Lee”) stating that the Plaintiff could be awarded 12% of permanent incapacity (as based on the <span class="font-italic">Guide to the Assessment of Traumatic Injuries &amp; Occupation Diseases for Work Injury Compensation </span>(5th Rev Ed, 2011), Ministry of Manpower, Singapore)(“<span class="font-italic">Assessment of Traumatic Injuries</span>”), was unchallenged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The dispute was over the chance of recurrent infection. According to Dr Lee, as the Plaintiff had already developed osteomyelitis, it was very likely that the Plaintiff may have recurrence of the infection which may require operation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Similarly, Dr Siow Wei Ming (“Dr Siow”) of SGH stated during cross-examination that even though the Plaintiff was discharged from follow ups in the clinic, it would simply mean that there was no active infection in the bone at the time of the discharge. He noted that there was always a risk of reactivation in the future because bone was a large spongy cavernous space and there was a chance for microscopic bacteria to remain in the bone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Defendant contended that there is no conclusive evidence to suggest such recurrence and that the chance of recurrent infection is extremely unlikely since the implants had been removed. The Defendant relied primarily on the expert evidence of Dr Chang Wei Chun (“Dr Chang”) and Dr Chang’s medical report dated 30 September 2016. On that basis, the Defendant submitted that a reasonable award for the injuries to the right ankle would be $25,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Plaintiff submitted that an appropriate award for the injuries in the right ankle/foot should be $35,000 to take into account both the comminuted intra-articular fractures and the osteomyelitis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In this regard, the Plaintiff highlighted that the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases </span>(Academy Publishing, 2010) (the “<span class="font-italic">Guidelines</span>”) at p 51, provides a range of $25,000 to $33,500 in light of the complicated fracture of the ankle that requires a long and extensive period of treatment (including physiotherapy) and recovery, significant residual disability involving reduced ankle mobility and instability on a permanent basis, and the complications of infection during the recovery period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the injuries in this case were more serious than those in <span class="font-italic">Lim Jun Kai (Lin June Kai) v Orientus Country Clubs &amp; Resorts Pte Ltd </span>(DC Suit No. 1010 of 2011), <span class="font-italic">Haji Omar bin Mohamed Kassim v Lee Beng Heng </span>(HC Suit No. 206 of 2008 and <span class="font-italic">Salinah Binte Yusop v The Legal Representative of Muhammad Farhal Dominic Rappa @ Dominic Wilfred Rappa (deceased) </span>(HC Suit No. 551 of 2008). Unlike the aforementioned three cases, the Plaintiff also suffered from the additional complication of osteomyelitis during the recovery period. The Plaintiff is also likely to suffer from a recurrence of infection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Based on the authorities and range of awards canvassed before me and in line with the appropriate range identified under the <span class="font-italic">Gu</span><span class="font-italic">idelines</span>, I award <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$3</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">2,000</span> to the Plaintiff for pain and suffering in relation to the right ankle injury.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Back injuries</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is not disputed that the Plaintiff sustained a compression fracture of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies. Dr Lee’s report stating that based on the <span class="font-italic">Assessment of Traumatic Injuries </span>the Plaintiff could be awarded 5% of permanent disability for “the compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body of &lt;25% with residual pain, no neurological deficits” was unchallenged. The L1 and L2 vertebral fracture was treated without an operation with a thoracolumbar spinal orthosis brace in SGH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 To date, the Plaintiff suffers from back pain. The Plaintiff has residual stiffness and lower back pain with inability to carry heavy loads. The pain has improved over time but is aggravated by the weather. As of 25 May 2017, the Plaintiff still complained of persistent pain to his treating doctors at SGH. The Plaintiff is on painkillers for his back pain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In relation to the back injuries, the dispute was over (a) the extent of the injury and (b) whether the resurgence of back pain complained of by the Plaintiff was due to the injury or a pre-existing degenerative condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Defendant contended that there is no conclusive evidence that the pain suffered by the Plaintiff was attributable to the accident. The Defendant submitted that an appropriate award should be $20,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is not disputed that the Plaintiff has a pre-existing degenerative disc disease involving the L5/S1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 When Dr Chang examined the Plaintiff on 14 September 2016, in respect of the lumbar spine, Dr Chang noted that there was no deformity, no localised pain, no tenderness of the spine, no paravertebral muscle spasm, no nerve root tension signs in the lower limbs and no neurological deficit in his limbs referable to the spine. The only positive symptom was some restriction of lumbar spine movement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 These observations were similar to those found by Dr Lee when he saw the Plaintiff on 10 June 2016. Dr Lee noted paravertebral muscles tenderness and restricted range of lumbar spine motion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As of the hearing on 11 July 2017, the Plaintiff’s doctors at SGH were still conducting further investigations as to whether the alleged pain symptoms were attributable to the L1/L2 fractures or a pre-existing degenerative condition which existed prior to the accident. Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence that the pain suffered by the Plaintiff was attributable to injuries resulting from the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Plaintiff submitted that an appropriate award for the injuries in the back should be $35,000. In this regard, the Plaintiff highlighted that the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines</span> at p 23 provide a range of $25,000 to $30,000 for “permanent and continuing severe back pain and discomfort such that the person is unable to sit or stand for prolonged periods…restricted movement of the lumbar spine, decreased sexual function, reduced flexibility and significant neurological deficits”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Both Dr Lee and Dr Chang opined that there was no neurological injury. I therefore find it inappropriate to classify the back injury as “severe”. The correct approach is to refer to the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines</span> for “moderate” injuries. The appropriate award for the compression fracture of the lumbar spine should range from $15,000 - $25,000 for fracture of one vertebra. A discount is to be applied for overlap of two or more such fractures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In considering the appropriate quantum of award, I agreed with the Defendant’s submission that the injuries in this case are similar to the case of <span class="font-italic">Pandian Marimuthu v</span><span class="font-italic"> Guan Leong Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2002]<span class="font-italic"> </span>SGDC 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Pandian Marimuthu</span>”), where the claimant was awarded $20,000 in relation to his back injury. In <span class="font-italic">Pandian Marimuthu</span>, the court found that the plaintiff suffered wedge compression fracture of the L2 and L3 vertebra: see [101]. The resulting disabilities (relating to the back injury) included pain in the back throughout the day, inability to run, jump or carry heavy objections. The court made a finding that the plaintiff could not continue doing manual or farming work but could only do desk bound work of a light nature. As <span class="font-italic">Pandian Marim</span><span class="font-italic">uthu </span>is of considerable vintage, allowance has to be made to take into account inflation and the present day cost of living.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Based on the authorities and range of awards canvassed before me and in line with the appropriate range identified under the <span class="font-italic">Guideline</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, I award <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">25,000</span> to the Plaintiff for pain and suffering in relation to the fractures of the L1/L2 vertebral body. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the right foot</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It was clear from the evidence of the three medical experts that osteoarthritis had not set in. The Plaintiff submitted that an award of $5,000 should be made for this item. The Defendant submitted that given that it is not definite that osteoarthritis will set in, a $3,000 award should be made. I agree with the Defendant and therefore award <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$3,000</span> for the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis to the right ankle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiple scars</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Plaintiff underwent surgery for the fractures in his right ankle. The following incision scars were noted on the Plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a 10cm L-shaped scar over the lateral aspect of the right calcaneus; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a 2.5cm incision scar below the lateral malleolus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Plaintiff submitted that an award of $10,000 should be made for this item. In this regard, the Plaintiff highlighted that the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 57 provided a range of $5,000 to $15,000 for multiple scars. The Defendant submitted that an award of $3,000 should be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Both the Plaintiff and Defendant relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Tian Shaokai v Tiong Hwa Steel Structures Pte Ltd </span>(HC Suit No. 689 of 2011)(“<span class="font-italic">Tian Shaokai</span>”). In the case of <span class="font-italic">Tian Shaokai, </span>the plaintiff sustained left ankle injuries and had (a) an 18.5 cm scar over the medial aspect of the right ankle; (b) an 8 cm scar over the medial aspect of the left ankle, and (c) two separate 1 cm scars over the dorsum of the left ankle. An award of $3,000 was given for the four scars.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The nature of the injury in the case of <span class="font-italic">Tian Shaokai</span> is similar to the nature of the injury in the present case. I therefore award <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$3,000</span> for the multiple scars. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Muscle Wastage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Plaintiff claimed $2,000 for muscle wastage. It is not in dispute that there was some muscle wastage. The following instances of muscle wastage were noted in Dr Lee’s medical report:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 2cm wasting of the right thigh and 2cm wasting of the calf muscles; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “the girth of the right and left ankles as measured using a figure of ‘8’ was 46cm and 45 cm respectively”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Defendant submitted that the muscle wastage was a resulting symptom from the right heel injury which did not warrant a separate award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Having read the submissions from both parties, I find that the muscle wastage necessitates a separate award of damages and I award <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$2,000</span> for the muscle wastage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In summary, I award the sum of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">65,000</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>for pain and suffering.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Future medical treatments and expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Subtalar Joint Fusion Surgery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The subtalar joint is a joint just below the ankle. Subtalar joint fusion surgery is a form of treatment for post-traumatic arthritis at the subtalar joint. The parties did not dispute that the cost of a subtalar joint fusion surgery was approximately $6,110. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The three medical doctors who gave evidence at the hearing differed on whether the Plaintiff was a good candidate for subtalar joint fusion surgery. Dr Siow said that based on the case notes, the Plaintiff was not a good candidate for fusion surgery. Dr Lee stated that the Plaintiff will require the fusion surgery to ease the pain in his ankle. During cross-examination, Dr Chang indicated that if the pain worsened, the Plaintiff should be offered subtalar joint fusion surgery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Overall, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff will eventually require a subtalar joint fusion surgery. First, it is not in dispute that the Plaintiff is predisposed to arthritis. Second, as this is an ankle joint, arthritis is likely to arise over time from the Plaintiff using the joint while walking. Third, even though the treating doctors had stated that the Plaintiff was not a good candidate for fusion surgery, both the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s medical experts indicated that they would still recommend the surgery if the pain in the ankle worsened. I therefore award <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$6,110</span> for the cost of a subtalar joint fusion surgery. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Physiotherapy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  The Plaintiff only attended four physiotherapy sessions at SGH during the period immediately after the initial surgery. He attended physiotherapy sessions on 22 June 2015, 22 July 2015, 26 August 2015 and 21 September 2015. Thereafter, he attended one physiotherapy session on 17 January 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Defendant pointed out that the Plaintiff has taken no steps to continue with his physiotherapy. The Defendant submitted that this shows that the Plaintiff’s claim for separate courses of physiotherapy for the back and right ankle injuries is unreasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 When the Plaintiff was cross-examined on his attendance of physiotherapy sessions, the Plaintiff conceded that he did not attend any after 17 January 2017. The following extract is instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">DC: I need to find out some information about the treatment you received in SGH. After your accident in May 2015, I have on record your attendance for physiotherapy, four times. Once a month in June, July, August and September 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">P: Yes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">DC: Can you remember what your physiotherapist did during each of these sessions?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">P: Exercise my legs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">DC: It appears from the documents that your last visit was 21st September 2015. On paper. I mean, that’s what the medical bills say.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">P: Yes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">DC: I want to check whether after that date, do you remember going back for any more physiotherapy sessions?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">P: No. <span class="font-weight-bold">I told the physiotherapist that I would do the exercise myself </span>because it would be inconvenient for me to travel to the hospital for physiotherapy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 From the above, it is evident that the Plaintiff stopped attending the physiotherapy sessions because it was inconvenient for him to travel to the hospital. He is also able to do the physiotherapy exercises himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I find that the Plaintiff’s evidence betrays a lack of intention on the part of the Plaintiff to attend physiotherapy sessions. I therefore make no award for this item of claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Medical Consultation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Plaintiff claimed $6,300 for future medical consultations. The Defendant submitted that the award for this items should be $2,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Using a multiplier of 5 years, the Plaintiff submitted that he is expected to incur costs of medical consultation over the period of 5 years as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $70 per visit, at one visit a month for medical consultation with an ankle specialist.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $70 per visit, at 6 visits per year with a back specialist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 However, I note that there is no evidential support showing that the Plaintiff had gone for medical consultations or had been scheduled for medical consultations with such frequency since the accident. It may therefore be inferred that the Plaintiff does not require monthly medical consultations with specialists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In his closing submission, the Defendant submitted that there was no need for any specific treatment for the back and right injuries save for the occasional simple analgesia and exercises for up to 5 years at $800.00 per year. This provision would allow the Plaintiff to see a general practitioner about 2 to 3 times a year to get the medication and there was no need for a specialist follow-up for pain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, I note that the Defendant’s expert witness, Dr Chang, had stated that the Plaintiff will require follow ups with specialist 2 to 3 times a year for 5 years. Dr Chang also confirmed that the Plaintiff will need to visit a specialist for the back and a specialist for the ankle separately.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 An award for future expenses must be based on a forward-looking estimate of the Plaintiff’s reasonable future needs. Based on the evidence from the expert witnesses, I accept the Plaintiff’s contention that he is likely to require specialist medical consultations. Overall, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff will require medical consultation with an orthopaedic specialist (3 visits per year for the back and 3 visits per year for the ankle) for 5 years at $70 per visit. I therefore award the sum of<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">2,100</span> for cost of future medical consultations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analgesia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Both Dr Lee and Dr Chang agreed that provision for analgesia should be made for 5 years. Dr Lee submitted in his report that the cost of analgesia varied from $30 - $60 per month, depending on dosage. Dr Chang stated during cross-examination that the Plaintiff requires provision for analgesia at $800 per year for 5 years. Dr Chang’s figures are inclusive of the cost of medical consultation to visit a General Practitioner 2 to 3 times a year to get the medication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Plaintiff changed his position on this item between his opening statement and his closing submissions. In his opening statement, the Plaintiff was prepared to accept $3,600 for this item. In his closing submissions, the Plaintiff increased this amount to $3,750. No reason was given by the Plaintiff for the change in position. The increased amount is also not supported by the evidence of Dr Lee and Dr Chang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As I have addressed the cost of specialist medical consultations above, I award the sum of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$3,600</span> for cost of analgesia for 5 years. This amount falls within the range of estimates provided by Dr Lee and Dr Chang.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Joint supplementation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Plaintiff claimed $4,200 for joint supplementation. This is based on the suggestion of Dr Lee that joint supplementation will delay the onset of full-blown osteoarthritis in the right ankle and subtalar joints. The joint supplements by Dr Lee will cost $70 per month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Defendant’s position is that no award should be made for joint supplementation because this was never provided for by the Plaintiff’s treating doctors and there is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiff was taking any joint supplements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The evidence to support this item of claim is inadequate. I make no award for this claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Table 4B procedure – debridement with curettage and irrigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Plaintiff claimed $5,720 for the provision for debridement with curettage and irrigation (also known as a “Table 4B procedure”) to be performed in a government restructured hospital. This is based on the suggestion of Dr Lee who said that further debridement with curettage is needed in the event of recurrent chronic osteomyelitis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Defendant’s position is that there is no evidence to support this claim as the bone infection has been eradicated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As discussed at paragraph 19 above, I find that the Plaintiff is also likely to suffer from a recurrence of infection. I will therefore allow this claim of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$5,720</span> for the cost of a Table 4B procedure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In summary, I award the sum of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$17,530</span> for future costs of medical treatments and expenses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Future transport expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Plaintiff claimed $4,860 for future transport expenses. The Defendants submitted that the award for this items should be $300.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Using a multiplier of 5 years for future medical expenses, the Plaintiff submitted that he is expected to make 162 trips to the hospital over the period of 5 years as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 48 visits for physiotherapy for the ankle;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 24 visits for physiotherapy for the back;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 60 visits for medication consultation for the ankle;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) 30 visits for medical consultation for the back.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff then estimated that each round trip to the hospital would cost $30, resulting in $4,860 for 162 trips.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Defendant submitted that a round trip to a general practitioner or the hospital costs $20 and concluded that the Plaintiff should be allowed 3 trips a year for 5 years, making a total of $300.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I find the Plaintiff’s estimate of $30 per round trip to the hospital to be reasonable. The Defendant has not provided any evidence to persuade me that the amount claimed by the Plaintiff is unreasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Based on my findings that (a) the Plaintiff will require medical consultation with an orthopaedic specialist (3 visits per year for the back and 3 visits per year for the ankle) for 5 years at paragraph 55 above; and (b) the Plaintiff will not require physiotherapy, the estimated total number of trips to the hospital over 5 years is 30 trips in total. I therefore made a global award of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$900</span> for future transport expenses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss of earnings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It is not disputed that at the time of the accident, the Plaintiff was working as a painter earning a salary of $2,500 a month. Following the accident, the Plaintiff has not been able to return to his previous employment as a painter. He has also not been able to secure any gainful employment since the accident.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pre-trial loss of earnings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Plaintiff claimed pre-trial loss from May 2015 to August 2017 at $2,500 per month for a total of $67,500. Following the accident, the Plaintiff had received medical leave wages amounting to $20,920 up till the period ending May 2016. The Plaintiff therefore claimed pre-trial loss of earnings for the remaining sum of $46,580. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Defendant did not dispute that the Plaintiff’s average monthly earnings before the accident was $2,500 and that the Plaintiff should be compensated. However, the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff was obligated to mitigate his losses after the expiry of his medical leave in May 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I agree with the Defendant’s counsel that the Plaintiff had not done enough to mitigate his loss. All the medical experts agree that the Plaintiff can do sedentary to light work. The Plaintiff stated during cross examination that he did not make any attempts to look for employment. The Plaintiff also stated in his affidavit that he may be able to work as a newspaper vendor.  In my view, the evidence shows that the Plaintiff is able to find alternative employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As to the multiplicand, the Plaintiff estimated the earnings of a sedentary or light job to be $500 per month. However this was not supported by any documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In considering the Plaintiff’s reasonable earning level, I take reference from the Ministry of Manpower’s 2016 Table of Occupational Wages referred to by the Defendant. Of the types of occupation referred to in the table, I am of the view that possible alternative employment would be in the nature of an office/library attendant, odd job person and/or residential area cleaner.  The monthly median basic wage for the above three types of work is $1,176.33, whilst the monthly median gross wage for the above three types of work is $1,222.33. I shall adopt the median gross wage in the calculation of the appropriate multiplicand instead of the median basic wage as it is a clearer refection of the actual earnings that an employee would receive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Based on these figures, an appropriate multiplicand would be $1,277.67 (i.e. $2,500 - $1,222.33) per month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I will award $30,000 (i.e. $2,500 X 12 months) for pre-trial loss of earnings from May 2015 to May 2016. For the period from June 2016 to August 2017, I will award a sum of $19,165.05 (i.e $1,277.67 X 15 months) for pre-trial loss of earnings. After taking into consideration the $20,920 that the Plaintiff has received from the Defendant, the amount awarded to the Plaintiff for pre-trial loss of earnings for the period May 2015 to August 2017 is <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$28,</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">245.05.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of future earnings / loss of earning capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Damages for loss of future earnings (“LFE”) are intended to compensate a plaintiff for the difference between his post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income. For the Plaintiff to succeed in his claim for LFE here, he must prove a real and assessable loss on the evidence. On the other hand, an award of damages for loss of earning capacity (“LEC”) seeks to compensate the plaintiff’s risk of loss of present employment and the consequent disadvantage in competing in the employment market for another job.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Plaintiff claimed $240,000 for LFE and $100,000 for LEC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Defendant submitted that the amount to be awarded for LFE should be $43,142.40.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Multiplier for LFE</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Plaintiff submitted that the multiplier for LFE should be 10 years while the Defendant submitted that it should be 6 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In the absence of any factors which existed prior to the accident indicating that the plaintiff would have a shorter than normal working life, the “remaining working life” is obtained by deducting the plaintiff’s age at trial from the statutory minimum retirement age of 67. As the Plaintiff was 52 years old at the date of the hearing, I find that his remaining working life is 15 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In <span class="font-italic">Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon </span>[1996] 2 SLR (R) 420, the High Court assessed the 48-year-old plaintiff’s loss of future earnings using a multiplier of 8 years. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Tean Hoe v Hong Kong Industrial Co Pte Ltd </span>[2001] SGHC 303, the plaintiff was 51 years old at the time of the accident and 52 years old at the time of the assessment hearing. The court applied a 4 year multiplier for the calculation of loss of future earnings. I note that both these authorities were decided before the change in Singapore’s retirement laws. Considering the above cases, I am of the view that it would be appropriate to adopt a multiplier of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">8 years</span> in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Using the figure of $1,277.67 at [77] above as the multiplicand, we obtain an award for LFE at $1,277.67 x 8 x 12 = <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$122,656.32</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I make no award for LEC. The Plaintiff contended that his disabilities would affect his ability to perform light work in the future. However, there was no evidence tendered in support of that submission. The onus is on the Plaintiff to show that there is a real and substantive risk that he would lose his job performing light work before the estimated end of his employable life as a result of his disabilities.  I find that there is an inadequate basis to award LEC.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pre-trial transport expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Plaintiff claimed $950 for pre-trial transport expenses. No receipts were provided The Plaintiff submitted that he had not retained all his taxi receipts, save for some which he had exhibited in his AEIC. The Plaintiff submitted that the medical bills evidenced his visits to the clinic and hospital and that based on the tabulation of medical bills in his AEIC, he had made 10 visits to the Hougang polyclinic and 22 visits to SGH. In addition to that, on the 2nd tranche of the hearing, the Plaintiff had submitted 3 receipts from SGH evidencing 3 more visits to the SGH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I am prepared to accept that the Plaintiff made approximately 25 trips for various treatments. While I accept that these trips took place, there is no evidence concerning the modes of transport used and the expenses incurred for each trip. Taking a conservative approach, I would allow $20 per trip for pre-trial transport expenses to arrive at an award of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$500</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 To summarise, the damages to be awarded is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) General damages</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pain and suffering $65,000.00</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Future medical expenses $17,530.00</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Future transport expenses $900.00</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Loss of future earnings $122,656.32</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Special damages</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pre-trial loss of earnings $28,245.05</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Medical expenses $9,434.23</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Transport expenses $500.00</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Total: $244,265.60</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The final award sum of $244,265.60 is still subject to the 90%/10% apportionment of damages countenanced by the interlocutory judgment by consent entered on 7 December 2016. Accordingly, the total payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff is the sum of $219,839.04.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Plaintiff claimed interest but did not elaborate on this claim in the submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As laid down in <span class="font-italic">Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat </span>[1994] 1SLR(R) 340 at [50]-[55], the Plaintiff is entitled to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) interest at 5.33% per annum for general damages for pain and suffering from the date of the writ of summons to the date of judgment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) interest at 2.67% per annum for special damages from the date of the accident to the date of judgment; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) no interest for future expenses and LFE/LEC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As such, I award 5.33% on general damages for pain and suffering from the date of service of the writ to the date of judgment, and 2.67% on special damages from the date of the accident to the date of judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Parties are to file and exchange written submissions on costs within two weeks from the date of this judgment, unless costs are agreed prior to that. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Li Yuen Ting <br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mr Namasivayam Srinivasan (M/s Hoh Law Corporation) for the Plaintiff; <br/>Ms Chey Cheng Chwen Anthony (RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
