</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This was an appeal by the plaintiffs and a cross-appeal by the

defendants, against the decision of the Assistant Registrar. The Assistant Registrar had

refused the plaintiffs’ application for discovery but had granted leave to the

plaintiffs to administer Interrogatories on the first defendant. After hearing the

arguments, I allowed both the plaintiffs’ and the defendants’ appeals. The first

defendant and the plaintiffs have now appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeals No.

600143/2001 and No. 600144/2001 respectively).</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The plaintiffs are part of the <b>Fila</b> Group of Companies which

are well-known manufacturers and retailers of sports apparel and footwear. The plaintiffs

are the proprietors of the following registered trademarks in Singapore: </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(i) TM No. B77477 (<b>FILA</b> logo) in Class 25 in respect of

"sports clothing, stockings and shoes"; and </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(ii) TM No. 81702 (<b>FILA</b> [stylised]) in Class 25 in respect of

"articles of sports clothings, stockings and shoes" (hereafter collectively

referred to as the ‘trade marks’). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The first defendant is the sole-proprietor of PT International

Corporation. The second defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore, of which the

first defendant is a director and a majority shareholder, holding 90,000 of the 100,000

paid-up shares in the company. Both defendants share the same office premises at 102F,

Pasir Panjang Road #06-07, Citilink Warehouse Complex, Singapore 118530. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. The plaintiffs took out this Originating Summons requesting for

pre-action discovery and Interrogatories with a view to commencing an action against the

first and second defendants for trade-mark infringement. In the affidavit in support of

the application, the plaintiffs' representative stated that more than 70,000 pairs of FILA

Tomaia-style sandals bearing counterfeits of the <b>FILA</b> and <b>FILA </b>logo

trade-marks had been seized pursuant to various raids conducted in Italy. Six container

loads of FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes bearing counterfeits of the <b>FILA</b> and <b>FILA</b>

logo trade-marks had also been seized during a raid in Sweden. The plaintiffs alleged that

the counterfeit FILA Tomaia-style sandals and FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes were

imported into Italy and Sweden by a Swiss company known as Dieseel GmbH (Dieseel). Dieseel

informed the plaintiffs that the counterfeit products had been obtained from the

defendants; a copy of an invoice together with shipping documents were annexed to the

affidavit in support of this allegation. The invoice, which was issued by PT International

Corporation and addressed to Dieseel, showed that 57,600 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style

sandals were shipped from Singapore to Genoa, Italy by the first defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. In prayers 1 and 3 of the application, the plaintiffs requested the

first and second defendants to each file an affidavit stating whether the following

documents are or have been in their possession, custody or power and, if not now in their

possession, custody or power, when they had parted with the same and what had become of

them:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(a) purchase orders, invoices, delivery order, receipts or any other

documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA

Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any products bearing the word <b>FILA</b> or the

"F" device (FILA products) by the defendants to Dieseel GmbH;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) correspondence between the defendants and Dieseel GmbH relating to

the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or

other FILA products;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other

documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA

Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products by the defendants to any

other parties, apart from Dieseel GmbH;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) correspondence between the defendants and any other parties (apart

from Dieseel GmbH) relating to the sale and supply by the defendants of FILA Tomaia-style

sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(e) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other

documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA

Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products from the defendants or vice

versa;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(f) correspondence between the first defendant and the second defendant

relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports

shoes and/or any other FILA products;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(g) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other

documents relating to the purchase, procurement or acquisition by the defendants of FILA

Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(h) correspondence between the defendants and their supplier/s relating

to the purchase, procurement or acquisition by the defendants of FILA Tomaia-style

sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The plaintiffs applied in prayers 2 and 4 for an order that the

defendants allow them within 14 days from the date of the order, to inspect the originals

or copies of the above documents and to make copies thereof. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. In prayers 5 and 7 of the application, the plaintiffs applied for

leave to administer the following Interrogatories to the first and second defendants

before the commencement of proceedings:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) Have you ever had any business dealings with a Swiss company known

by the name of Dieseel GmbH?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) state in detail how you came to know Dieseel GmbH;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) name the individual/s in your business who deals with Dieseel GmbH;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) name the individual/s in Dieseel GmbH who dealt with the

  individual/s in your business:</p>
<p align="justify">(d) state whether you at any time sold or supplied to Dieseel GmbH FILA

  Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) Did you at any time sell or supply FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or

FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products to any other party?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4) If the answer to (3) is in the affirmative:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) state in detail how you came to know the party identified in you

  answer to question (3) above;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) name the individual/s in your business who deals with the party

  identified in your answer to question (e) above;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) name the individual/s in the party identified in your answer to

  question (3) above who dealt with the individual/s in your business:</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5) Who did you obtain the FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA

Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products from?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(6) State in detail how you came to know the party or parties

identified in (5) above;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(7) Name the individual/s in your business who dealt with the party or

parties identified in (5) above; and</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(8) Name the individual/s in the party or parties identified in (5)

above with whom you dealt with.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The plaintiffs applied in prayers 8 and 9 for an order that the

defendants answer the Interrogatories set out above and for leave to be granted to the

plaintiffs to use the documents and/or information disclosed pursuant to the orders

against the defendants. <i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>

The decision below</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The Assistant Registrar refused to grant an order for discovery of

the documents set out above, but leave was granted to administer Interrogatories in para

6(1) and (2) to the first defendant before the commencement of proceedings. The first

defendant was ordered to answer the Interrogatories and file and serve the Answers on the

plaintiffs within 14 days of the order. The Assistant Registrar did not grant leave to the

plaintiffs to administer Interrogatories to the second defendant. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The plaintiffs appealed against the Assistant Registrar’s

decision in refusing to grant an order for discovery, in not allowing Interrogatories set

out in para 6(3) to (8) to be administered to the first defendant and, in not granting

leave to administer Interrogatories to the second defendant. Conversely, the defendants

appealed against the decision to grant leave to administer the Interrogatories set out in

para 6(1) and (2) above. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Order for discovery</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Before me, counsel for the defendants submitted that there was a

real likelihood that the disclosure as requested by the plaintiffs would expose the

defendants to prosecution under s 49 of the Trade Marks Act Cap 332 (the Act). It is

well-established in Singapore that the privilege against self-incrimination applies to

pre-trial discovery and is not abrogated or affected by s 134 of the Evidence Act Cap 97;

(see <i>Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang</i> <nobr>[1989] SLR 460</nobr>, <i>Guccio Gucci SpA v

Sukhdav Singh</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 553</nobr>, <i>Lee Thin Tuan v Louis Vuitton</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 273</nobr>). A defendant will be entitled to rely on the privilege if there is a real or

appreciable risk that incriminating answers will expose the defendant to arrest or

prosecution for any criminal offences (<i>Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang</i>). Section

49 of the Act states:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Any person who –</p>
<p align="justify">(a) ………………</p>
<p align="justify">(b) sells or exposes for sale; or</p>
<p align="justify">(c) ………………</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Any goods to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied shall,

  unless he proves that –</p>
<p align="justify">(i) having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an

  offence under this section, he had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence,

  no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark and on demand made by or on behalf of the

  prosecution, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from

  whom he obtained the goods; or</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) he had acted innocently,</p>
<p align="justify">be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not

  exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the trade mark is falsely applied (but

  not exceeding in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5

  years or to both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Counsel for the plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that the

defendants were not entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, as the

privilege has been abrogated by s 134 of the Evidence Act and that the line of authorities

established by <i>Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang</i> should not be followed. Counsel

for the plaintiffs cited authorities from Malaysia (see <i>Television Broadcasts Ltd v

Mandarin Video Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr>[1983] 2 MLJ 346</nobr><i>; AG of Hong Kong v Zauyah Wan Chik

And Others</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 MLJ 620</nobr>) and India, which held that the privilege against

self-incrimination had been abrogated by their equivalent to our s 134 of the Evidence

Act. Counsel also drew the court's attention to the position in England where (arising

from the House of Lords' decision in <i>Rank Film Distributions Ltd v Video Information

Centre &amp; Others</i> [1982] AC 380 which decision our courts followed), the privilege

had been statutorily withdrawn in intellectual property matters (by virtue of s 72 of the

Supreme Court Act 1981) and where the privilege had been criticised in the context of

civil proceedings. Section 134 of the Evidence Act states: -</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) A witness shall not be excused from answering any question as to

  any matter relevant to the matter in issue in any suit, or in any civil or criminal

  proceeding, upon the ground that the answer to such question will criminate, or may tend,

  directly or indirectly, to criminate, such witness, or that it will expose, or tend,

  directly or indirectly, to expose, such witness to a penalty or forfeiture of any kind, or

  that it will establish or tend to establish that he owes a debt or is otherwise subject to

  a civil suit at the instance of the Government or of any other person.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) No answer which a witness shall be compelled by the court to give

  shall subject him to any arrest or prosecution, or be proved against him in any criminal

  proceeding, except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such answer.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Before compelling a witness to answer a question the answer to

  which will criminate or may tend, directly or indirectly, to criminate such witness, the

  court shall explain to the witness the purport of subsection (2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. The first defendant had admitted in his affidavit that the goods as

disclosed in the shipping documents were supplied to Dieseel by him, but claimed he

honestly believed those goods were genuine. The first defendant stated in his affidavit

that he was claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, as he had been advised by

his solicitors that to reveal any particulars of transactions relating to the allegedly

counterfeit FILA goods would expose him to a real risk of being prosecuted for offences

under the Act. The second defendant stated in its affidavit that it did not deal with

Dieseel in respect of the sale of the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods and also claimed

the privilege against self-incrimination. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 I was of the opinion that the first defendant was <u>not</u>

entitled to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination. This was because he had

admitted that he supplied the goods to Dieseel as disclosed in the shipping documents; he

had already incriminated himself. Apart from his admission, the invoice clearly showed

that the first defendant had apparently supplied 57,600 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals

to Dieseel. Consequently, the first defendant could not claim the privilege in any event.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. In respect of the second defendant, counsel for the plaintiffs

submitted (as an alternative to the submission that the privilege had been abrogated in

Singapore), that the privilege against self-incrimination was not available to a company.

Reliance was placed on Australian and American authorities, which held that the privilege

only applied to natural persons and did not extend to incorporated companies. There was no

necessity in this regard to determine whether in Singapore the privilege against

self-incrimination could be relied on by companies since, there was no basis for an order

of discovery to be made against the second defendant in the first place. I was however

inclined to accept the argument of counsel for the plaintiffs that a company is not

entitled to claim privilege under s 134 of the Act, based on the strict wording of

subsections (1), (2) and (3). I note in this regard that none of the authorities cited by

counsel for the defendants (para 10 supra) involved companies but individuals as

defendants. Even so, the second defendant in its affidavit had denied any involvement with

Dieseel in respect of the sale of the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods; this was not

disputed by the plaintiffs. There was also no evidence to suggest that the second

defendant was involved in the supply of FILA goods to Dieseel. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. Consequently, I made the following orders for discovery:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. That the first defendant do within seven (7) days from the date of

  the order make and file an affidavit stating whether any of the following documents are or

  at any time have been in his possession, custody or power and, if not now in his

  possession, custody or power, when he parted with the same and what has become of them:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">purchase orders, invoices, delivery order, receipts or any other

    documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA

    Eurojogger-style sports shoes by the first Defendant to Dieseel GmbH, restricted to the

    approximately 70,000 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals seized in Italy and the six

    container loads of FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes seized in Sweden. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. That the first defendant do within fourteen (14) days from the date

  of the order allow the plaintiffs to inspect the originals (or copies, if originals are

  not available) of all documents disclosed pursuant to (1) above and to allow the

  plaintiffs to make copies thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Interrogatories</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. Counsel for the first defendant submitted that the Interrogatories

in para 6(1) and (2)(a) to (d) were irrelevant as they concerned matters which were not

part of a potential civil action and, that the questions were the plaintiffs’ attempt

to obtain information for the purposes of criminal proceedings. In particular, counsel

contended, the Interrogatory in (1) was unnecessary since the first defendant had already

confirmed that it had supplied the goods disclosed in the shipping documents to Dieseel.

Counsel claimed that as question (2)(d) was an attempt to uncover past acts of

infringement by the first defendant, the first defendant was entitled to rely on the

privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. I was of the opinion that the Interrogatories allowed below should

be administered to <u>both</u> and not only to the first, defendants. This was because the

invoice and the shipping documents clearly showed that the first defendant had indeed

dealt with Dieseel and, the first defendant was a director and a majority shareholder of

the second defendant which shared premises with the first defendant. However, under O 26A

r 2 of the Rules of Court, it was not necessary at this preliminary stage for

Interrogatories (2)(a) to (c) to be administered to the first defendant – the

plaintiffs can always re-apply for the same Interrogatories to be administered to the

first defendant at or after the discovery stage, once action has been commenced. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 At the conclusion of the hearing, I allowed the plaintiffs to

administer the following Interrogatories to both defendants before commencement of

proceedings: </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) Have you ever had any business dealings with a Swiss company known

by the name of Dieseel GmbH?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative, state whether you have

sold or supplied to Diseel GmbH FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA Eurojogger-style

sports shoes which form part of the goods seized by the plaintiffs in Italy and in Sweden.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">to be answered within 14 days of the date of the order. </p>
<p xmlns="">19. Interrogatory 2 above was a revised and restricted version of the original

Interrogatory 2(d) the plaintiffs had applied to administer to both defendants. I had

limited the scope of the question to those goods the plaintiffs had already seized in

Italy and Sweden, instead of allowing the plaintiffs to obtain information generally on

whether the defendants had sold/supplied to Diseel <i>'any/or any other FILA products</i>'.

I was of the view that Interrogatories should not be used by trade-mark proprietors as a <i>carte

blanche</i> to obtain any information they chose, as a substitute (and an easy one at

that) for their own investigations into possible infringement of their

trade-marks/trade-names and above all, the procedure should not be misused to shift the

burden of disproving the infringement, onto the other party resisting the application. </p>
