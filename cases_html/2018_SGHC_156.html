He paid the money to the defendant either himself or through family members and either in the form of traveller’s cheques purchased in New Zealand or as cash.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff’s case in this action is simple: (i) the defendant became the trustee of all of the money which she received from him; (ii) she therefore owes him a number of fiduciary duties, including a duty to account for how she managed and invested the money; and (iii) she is in breach of those fiduciary duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff’s claim rests on events which took place as long ago as 1993. The oral evidence before me is stale and the documentary evidence is limited. The passage of time also raises interesting questions at the intersection of the law of limitation and the law of trusts. Those questions have ultimately proved to be determinative of this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I have found that the plaintiff’s action for an account is time-barred by s 6(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”). In any event, I would have exercised my discretion not to grant an order for an account.  The plaintiff has appealed against my decision. I therefore now set out my reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of my findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The following is a summary of my findings. The defendant did receive substantially all of the sums of money which the plaintiff claims to have paid to her. It is common ground that the plaintiff did not intend to make a gift of these sums to the defendant. She therefore held each sum, as and when received, on a presumed resulting trust for the plaintiff. That does not mean, in itself, that the defendant owed the plaintiff any fiduciary duties. But she did owe the plaintiff at least a duty to account and a duty not to place herself in a position of conflict between her personal interests and the plaintiff’s interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff’s claim, however, is time-barred. The plaintiff commenced this action on 28 April 2014. It is common ground that the plaintiff last paid a sum of money to the defendant in 2007. Section 6(2) of the Limitation Act bars a claim for an account in so far as the plaintiff seeks to go back more than six years before the action was commenced. That section applies to an action for an account arising from a resulting trust as it does in the case of one arising from an express trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 None of the exceptions to s 6(2) created by s 22(1) of the Limitation Act apply. First, the defendant, although in breach of her duty to account, is not in fraudulent breach of that duty. Second, the defendant did not breach her duty not to place herself in a position of conflict between her own interests and those of the plaintiff. Finally, the plaintiff has failed to prove that any of the trust property remains in the defendant’s possession or has been converted by her to her own use.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Finally, quite apart from s 6(2) of the Limitation Act, I would have exercised my discretion not to order the defendant to render an account to the plaintiff because it would be oppressive to do so and because there is no good reason to order the defendant now to render an account going back almost a quarter century which would justify the time, cost and effort which the defendant would have to incur in preparing it. The evidence before me does not indicate that the defendant has committed a possible fraud which taking an account might uncover. Further, the plaintiff was aware at all times of how the defendant was managing and investing his money. Indeed, he took an active role in considering and approving certain investments which she made on his behalf.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The plaintiff and his wife, Mdm Heng Fock Too (also known as Elina Lim) married in or around 1990.

The main asset of GK Holding was a commercial property in Sim Lim Square at 1 Rochor Canal Road which was let to retail shops and a food court. I shall call this the “Rochor property”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The parties invested in shares in GK Holding in two tranches. They acquired the first tranche in 1994. At that time, a shareholder of GK Holding was offering 15% of the company for sale. The defendant told the plaintiff about this opportunity. The plaintiff agreed to buy 10% of GK Holding out of the 15% on offer. The defendant agreed to buy the remaining 5%. The defendant paid Teo Chye Har, a minority shareholder of GK Holding, for these shares. As a result of this purchase, the plaintiff became the legal owner of 15% of GK Holding. He held 10% for himself and the additional 5% for the defendant. In 1999, he transferred that 5% to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The parties acquired their second tranche of shares in GK Holding in 2000, when the majority shareholder sold all his remaining shares. The plaintiff purchased an additional 15% of GK Holding and the defendant purchased an additional 20%. As a result, they each now held 25% of GK Holding. Teo Chye Har purchased the remaining shares on offer and increased her shareholding to 50%. The defendant and her husband then took over the day to day management of GK Holding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 At that time, the defendant was also managing a business called Yi Kang Food &amp; Beverage (“Yi Kang”). Yi Kang’s business was running a drinks stall from a unit at the Rochor property which it had leased from GK Holding. In 2005, when Yi Kang’s business picked up, the defendant began to share a portion of its profits with the plaintiff out of goodwill. The defendant later started two other food and beverage ventures which each leased a unit at the food court in the Rochor property from GK Holding. They were known as Dessert@Sim Lim Square LLP and Sleek Espresso Bar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In 2012, GK Holding sold the Rochor property for about S$39m. The net proceeds of sale were distributed among the shareholders <span class="font-italic">pro rata</span>. The defendant and her husband then bought all the remaining shares in GK Holding from the plaintiff and Teo Chye Har. The plaintiff’s share of the proceeds from the sale of the Rochor property combined with the proceeds of the sale of his shares in GK Holding totalled about $8.75m.

</div> I do not understand that explanation. While profiting from movements in foreign exchange rates, or hedging against those movements, is a plausible reason for converting money back and forth between currencies, that does not require the money to travel literally from New Zealand to Singapore and back again. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The plaintiff was defensive and evasive when cross-examined both about his reason for using a false name to buy the traveller’s cheques and his reason for moving his money from New Zealand to Singapore and back again. To that extent, I consider that the defendant has successfully shown that there is a basis for approaching the plaintiff’s oral evidence with some caution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Having said that, I do not think that this point ought to affect my assessment of the plaintiff’s oral evidence on the issue I am now considering, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> whether the plaintiff paid this money to the defendant, either personally or through family intermediaries. This is because this point, made in the way the defendant has made it, entails the defendant’s implicitly accepting that the plaintiff did pay money to the defendant and suggests only that he did so for clandestine or illicit reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Moreover, even if I find that the plaintiff purchased travellers’ cheques in false names to ensure that they could not be traced back to him, that finding is no indication of the plaintiff’s ultimate purpose in moving money from New Zealand to Singapore and back again. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 So attacking the plaintiff’s credibility in the way that the defendant has done does not assist to prove that the plaintiff did not pay a particular sum of money to the defendant. It assists only to prove that the plaintiff had a dishonest or unlawful ultimate purpose for doing so. But that is no part of any of the defendant’s pleaded defences. Accordingly, I shall not speculate or make any finding on what the plaintiff’s ultimate purpose might be. It suffices to say that the plaintiff’s impaired credibility has only limited effect on how I assess his evidence of his payments to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The second way in which the defendant attacks the plaintiff’s credibility is by arguing that he did not have the financial resources to pay the large sums of money which he claims to have paid her.

</div> I also accept that he was a man of sufficient means to have made these payments to the defendant. I find that he changed his evidence because he genuinely could not remember the specific details of his financial position from 1983 to 2003 and was attempting to square his memory with the facts presented to him in cross-examination. The plaintiff was asked in cross-examination about matters which took place more than two decades earlier. The deterioration of memory which accompanies that length of time more plausibly explains his inability to recall accurately the details of his historical financial position and to calculate his historical net worth than a supposed desire to conceal the fact that his wealth was more limited than implied by his alleged payments to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Moreover, as the plaintiff submits, it is no part of the defendant’s pleaded case that the plaintiff could not have paid the sums of money to her as he alleges because he did not have the financial resources to do so.

He said only that the solicitors’ letter had been drafted without Andrew’s confirmation of the amount. The plaintiff testified that he and his wife later realised US$80,000 was not “feasible”, and they obtained confirmation from Andrew that he had actually carried only “two bundle [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”, which indicated a sum of US$20,000.

</div>
</div> It is suspicious that the plaintiff would characterise the physical delivery of cash from New Zealand to Singapore as a “game”. I need not speculate what that “game” might be. The point is that the plaintiff’s evidence suggests that the novelty of the “game” to Andrew meant that the plaintiff would not have entrusted Andrew with carrying as large an amount in cash as US$80,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Second, this reading of the plaintiff’s evidence explains why he thought it was not “feasible” for Andrew to have carried US$80,000. It was not feasible in the sense that the plaintiff would not have thought it appropriate to give Andrew such a large sum of money if that was his first time delivering money to the defendant. That to my mind is a very specific reason that is consistent with the plaintiff’s reticence on the ultimate purpose in sending his money from New Zealand on a return journey to Singapore. That is not, however, the concern of this case. Accordingly, I accept that the defendant has a basis for revising the figure from US$80,000 to US$20,000. His evasiveness on what that basis is says more to me about its propriety than about its absence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Next, the defendant contends that the letter is self-serving because it was drafted and signed for no purpose other than to support the plaintiff’s case.

</div> The defendant’s counsel highlighted to the plaintiff in cross-examination that the wording of parts of the letter is very similar to the wording of the relevant section of the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief. The letter states that the plaintiff had handed Andrew the cash with the “specific request” that the cash be given to the defendant. The plaintiff’s affidavit similarly uses the words “specific request”, albeit to describe how the defendant asked the plaintiff to pay specific sums of money to her.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 There is some, albeit limited, force in the defendant’s submission on this point. While the plaintiff denies having a hand in drafting Andrew’s letter, he has volunteered the fact that he confirmed the amount of US$20,000 with Andrew at or around the date of the letter. The use of the term “specific request” could have arisen out of their discussions. And that term on its own is in any event insufficient grounds for the inference that the plaintiff directed Andrew to draft the letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In view of both the plaintiff’s and Andrew’s evidence, I find that the defendant did receive a sum of US$20,000 in cash from the plaintiff through Andrew in or around April 1999. Again, I make no finding on what she did with the cash, if she did anything with it at all, and whether it remains in her possession.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Category C</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I pause here to make a general point about the evidence on Category C transactions. A substantial part of the plaintiff’s evidence consists of his general description of his usual practice in giving the defendant cash, with no specific evidence of specific details of specific instances in which he did so. In other words, his evidence is based on reconstruction rather than recollection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Reconstructed evidence is of limited value. It is self-serving and is particularly susceptible to the influence of hindsight. It is therefore a significantly weaker form of evidence than evidence from actual recollection. Saying it has limited value is not, however, to say it has no value whatsoever.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 A case like the present involves an allegation of repeated transactions which occurred over a long period of time. It is natural in those circumstances for a witness to have difficulty retrieving specific recollections of specific details of specific transactions. Further, the transactions in this case took place a decade or more in the past. It is therefore also natural that recollections will have faded. In cases of this type, evidence from reconstruction rather than recollection is likely to be all that a witness can offer the court. I cannot, therefore, discount credibility simply because the plaintiff or his witnesses gives evidence from reconstruction rather than recollection. I bear these considerations in mind in my assessment and description of the witnesses’ evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It is also useful first to describe the parties’ evidence on the Category C transactions before each of the transactions is analysed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiff’s evidence is that it was his practice to pay the defendant US$100,000 every year.

That basis, as it emerged from the cross-examination of the plaintiff, comprises two aspects. First, the plaintiff assumes a starting point of US$100,000 for each year. He then adjusts that value up or down according to whether, in his recollection, his business in New Zealand did well that year.

I discuss this further at [126] below. The defendant also gave evidence that the plaintiff sometimes required her to count the cash he had brought. This was a frustrating activity for her as the counting could have been done at a money changer.

To avoid repetition, I state from the outset that the analysis of each transaction takes into account the reconstructive nature of the evidence of the plaintiff and his wife, as I have just explained. It also takes into account the basic import of that evidence, namely, that the plaintiff and his wife had an established practice of bringing cash to the defendant in Singapore, and that the defendant at the very least participated in counting that cash and driving the plaintiff and his wife to money changers to convert the cash into the desired currency. Finally, it takes into account the evidence, what little there is, on what happened to this cash.

The answer must be that she did. Before supplying my reasons, I should foreshadow that the proper analysis of the resulting trust in the present case, which I undertake in this section, will have some (albeit limited) effect on whether the defendant may be said to owe the plaintiff any fiduciary duties and on the content of those duties, which I shall examine in due course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The Court of Appeal has expressed a preference for Professor Robert Chambers’ view that a resulting trust arises whenever the intention of a transferor to benefit a transferee is vitiated or absent: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</span> <span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [35] <span class="font-italic">per </span>V K Rajah JA; <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [44] <span class="font-italic">per</span> V K Rajah JA. That preference, however, has not led to an abolition (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [51]) of either the doctrine of presumed resulting trust or the classical distinction between presumed and automatic resulting trusts. Those terms, of course, are the labels for the two sets of circumstances identified by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 708A–B as giving rise to a resulting trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under existing law, a resulting trust arises in two sets of circumstances: (A) where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of a joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contributions.

</div> It is, however, common ground that the plaintiff paid money to the defendant voluntarily, not intending to make a gift to her of the money. Therefore, the correct analysis of the resulting trust which arose in this case is that it is a presumed resulting trust, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the first type of resulting trust which Lord Browne-Wilkinson describes in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Since it is common ground that the plaintiff had no donative intent, there is no need to consider whether the presumption that Lord Browne-Wilkinson speaks of has been rebutted. In any event, it would have been an uphill task. The Court of Appeal has held that the strength of the presumption of a resulting trust varies with the circumstances in which the resulting trust arises, and correspondingly, the quality of evidence required to rebut the presumption varies with the strength of the presumption: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [52] <span class="font-italic">per</span> V K Rajah JA. As I will show below, the defendant was actively involved in managing and investing the plaintiff’s assets in a manner which demonstrated her full awareness that the plaintiff had no intention of vesting in her the beneficial interest in his money or in the assets which she acquired with his money. The defendant would have been hard-pressed to rebut the plaintiff’s presumed lack of donative intent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The defendant argues, however, that a further requirement for a resulting trust is that the transferor must have transferred property into the transferee’s sole name and not into their joint names.

The submission is also inconsistent with the premise of many family trust cases, including the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, in which a frequent bone of contention is whether the presumption of resulting trust over property transferred into joint names is rebutted by the counter-presumption of advancement.

The principle behind these cases should not be missed. A joint owner of property for which she did not pay, like a sole owner of such property, is vested with legal title to the property.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Closing Supplementary Submissions dated 23 January 2017 at para 14.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This is a misreading of the case. <span class="font-italic">Alagappa</span> concerned a family trust managed by two brothers, C and S. One of the issues was whether S was in an overdrawn position with regard to a family account held in their joint names which they were entitled to draw on for their personal expenses. On appeal, S challenged the amount by which the trial judge had found him to be overdrawn. S succeeded by showing that the judge had failed to credit to S, among other sums, a sum of $109,902 in four cheques which S had given C for the purpose of the family account. S was able to prove that C had instead deposited these cheques into his sole account for his own use. So the court found that C was a resulting trustee of the sum of $109,902: <span class="font-italic">Alagappa</span> at [50] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Judith Prakash J (as she then was). Accordingly, it is plain that the existence of the resulting trust had nothing to do with whether that sum was transferred into a joint or sole account <span class="font-italic">per se</span> and everything to do with S’s presumed lack of donative intent in relation to C in giving him the cheques. <span class="font-italic">Alagappa</span> therefore provides no support to the defendant’s submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Finally, I note that the defendant did not receive the sums of US$1,376,000, S$1,584,367.40 and RMB100,000 from the plaintiff all at once. That can mean one of two things. First, it can mean that a single resulting trust arose upon the first payment, with every subsequent payment being an accretion to the trust property which was the subject-matter of that single trust. Or it could mean that a separate and fresh resulting trust arose every time the plaintiff paid a sum to the defendant, with that single sum as the trust property. The former analysis might have been correct if I had found that the plaintiff intended to create an express trust by his payment to the defendant in 1993 and continued contributing to the trust property over the years until the trust failed sometime after 2007 and a resulting trust arose. But that is not what happened and not what I have held. I have held that the money was held on a presumed resulting trust, not an automatic resulting trust. The latter is therefore the correct analysis in this case. Conceptually speaking, the series of sums which the plaintiff, acting with no donative intent, paid to the defendant as a volunteer from 1993 to 2007 became the subject-matter of a series of separate resulting trusts, all of which had the defendant as the resulting trustee and the plaintiff as the <span class="font-italic">cestui qu</span><span class="font-italic">e trust</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 It is, however, also the case that the defendant has not rebutted any of the presumptions of resulting trusts with regard to the twenty or so transactions through which she received the plaintiff’s money. One piece of evidence that the defendant relied on in this regard is her evidence that the plaintiff repaid her in cash a debt which he owed to her arising from her payment on his behalf when he purchased his second tranche of shares in GK Holding.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Heng Fock Lin’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief dated 10 June 2016 at para 60.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> But it is not the defendant’s evidence that any of Category A, B or C transactions was a repayment of this nature. And the plaintiff denies that the debt was even incurred. So the first point I make is that the evidence on which the defendant relies is inconclusive. Second, even if the plaintiff did have donative intent in giving the defendant some money (to pay off his debt to her), there is no evidence that that cash was any part of the total sums which I have found the plaintiff to have paid the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 For these reasons, I conclude that the defendant held the sums of US$1,376,000, S$1,584,367.40 and RMB100,000 on resulting trust for the plaintiff. For convenience, I will consider these sums in the analysis below as being subject to a single resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff. Where however there is a need to analyse allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties in respect of specific sums, I will analyse the individual resulting trust over that sum and the fiduciary duties which go with it: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span> [217] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The third issue which I have to determine is whether the defendant, as a trustee under a resulting trust, owes the plaintiff any fiduciary duty or duties, including the duty to account for the money. The proper approach to this issue was set out in the Court of Appeal’s recent decision in<span class="font-italic"> Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan </span><span class="font-italic">and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”), which I will discuss first. I will then consider the existence and nature of the fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, and whether that relationship gave rise to any fiduciary duties on the part of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 It is common ground that a resulting trustee has a duty to account by virtue of her trusteeship. The High Court has also taken this position. In <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2015] SGHC 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span>”), I took the view at [38] that a trustee’s duty to account is so fundamental that it is part of the irreducible core of a trust, such that a resulting trust must also be taken to encompass such a duty. A number of Canadian cases also adopt a similar analysis: see <span class="font-italic">MacQuarrie v Barber</span> (1993) 146 AR 81; <span class="font-italic">Archer v St John </span>[2008] AJ No 446 (“<span class="font-italic">Archer</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Archer</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the defendant gratuitously received a plot of land from the deceased and was by virtue of that fact held to be a resulting trustee of it. The court held that the defendant owed a duty to the estate to account for the revenue she received on the land, and that that duty arose together with the resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 That analysis has now to be revised in the light of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>. In that case,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal examined the question of whether a resulting trust is capable of encompassing fiduciary duties. The court observed that the concept of an irreducible core of trustee’s duties was developed in the context of express trusts and does not apply to all trusts, and certainly not to resulting trusts. This is because resulting trusts arise in a variety of situations, not all of which affect the conscience of the resulting trustee in such a way as to require her to act like an express trustee. Moreover, fiduciary obligations are voluntarily undertaken, in the sense that they arise as a consequence of the fiduciary’s conduct and are not imposed by law independently of the fiduciary’s intentions. Therefore, a resulting trustee will be burdened with only those fiduciary duties which she expressly or implicitly assumes. The court must examine objectively her conduct to determine whether she assumed such duties. Further, the precise content of the duties are not fixed but are to be deduced from the surrounding circumstances, including and especially any relationship between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The Court of Appeal came to these conclusions after analysing a comprehensive number of authorities. It distilled its analysis to the following test (at [206] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The real question, in our view, is whether, <span class="font-italic">objectively</span> speaking, the resulting trustee can be said to have undertaken (whether expressly or impliedly) to act in a particular way which is fiduciary in nature. In this regard, the knowledge that one does not hold the beneficial interest in the property is, while <span class="font-italic">not</span> a <span class="font-italic">sufficient</span> condition by itself, strictly <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> because the conscience cannot otherwise be affected in a way that equity can take cognisance of. The duties that are applicable to each resulting trustee will vary significantly, and are very <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">fact-specific</span>. The duties owed by a resulting trustee to the settlor-beneficiary will, however, almost invariably be narrower than the duties owed by an express trustee in relation to the beneficiaries. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In formulating this test, the court relied on the work of Professor Robert Chambers – as it did in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> – among other academic writers. The court made reference to Chambers’ theory of a scale of resulting trust obligations that corresponds to the circumstances in which resulting trusts arise: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>at [200]. Chambers draws a broad distinction between fiduciary obligations at the higher and lower end of the scale. That distinction did not ultimately feature in the Court of Appeal’s test (cited in the preceding paragraph) although it no doubt informed the content of that test. But the Chambers’ scale played a significant role in the court’s application of the test to the facts of the case. I therefore find it appropriate to set out the relevant part of Chambers’ analysis, which can be found in Robert Chambers, <span class="font-italic">Resulting Trusts</span> (Oxford University Press, 1997, reprinted 2006) at pp 198–199:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the lower end of the scale are cases where the resulting trust arises in the absence of any pre-existing fiduciary relationship and without the knowledge of the resulting trustee. <span class="font-italic">Sinclair v. Brougham</span> was just such a case and, although it has been overruled with respect to whether a payment under a void contract gives rise to a resulting trust, it contains valuable insights into the consequences of resulting trusts in situations involving innocent recipients. In <span class="font-italic">Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. </span>v. <span class="font-italic">Israel-British Bank (London)</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd.</span>, Goulding J. used <span class="font-italic">Sinclair </span>v. <span class="font-italic">Brougham </span>to support his conclusion that ‘a person who pays money to another under a factual mistake retains an equitable property in it and the conscience of the other is subject to a fiduciary duty to respect his proprietary right’. In other words, an event gives rise to the recipient’s fiduciary obligation to respect the provider’s proprietary right. As the Texas Supreme Court stated, the resulting trust is ‘a fiduciary relationship … insofar as the trust property is concerned’. The fiduciary obligations need not extend beyond those necessary to protect the provider’s interest in that property. There is no reason to involve the strict duties of loyalty applicable to an express trustee. In <span class="font-italic">Sinclair v. Brougham</span>, Viscount Haldane L.C. held that there had ‘been no breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the society’ even though the society had received the depositors’ money on resulting trust and used it for its own benefit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the higher end of the scale are cases where the resulting trust arises on the failure of an express trust. The resulting trustee has agreed to obey strict rules of fidelity and exercise a certain standard of care as an express trustee and there is no reason for those obligations to cease when the express trust fails (unless the resulting trustee reasonably believes himself or herself to be entitled to the surplus). The trustee is already in a fiduciary relationship when the resulting trust arises (albeit with the beneficiaries of the express trust and not the settlor). Although the resulting trustee is a fiduciary only ‘insofar as the trust property is concerned’, that must involve the same duties of loyalty and care he or she has previously consented to observe with respect to that same property. As Ford and Lee state: ‘Where the resulting trust arises in relation to an express trust the trustee’s duties of administration under the express trust will be owed as much for the benefit of the person entitled under the resulting trust as for the benefit of any beneficiaries under the express trust’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, the Court of Appeal found that the eldest sister in a family held, among other things, certain shares on resulting trust for her four siblings, all of whom had earlier transferred those shares to her. One of the issues was whether she owed her siblings any fiduciary duties as a resulting trustee. The court held that as a resulting trustee, she had impliedly undertaken to act honestly and in good faith in relation to her siblings in dealing with those shares, at least to the extent that her conduct ought not to be for her own benefit. Focusing on her knowledge of the circumstances, the court found that she knew that the beneficial ownership of the shares vested not in her but in her four siblings. And she knew specifically that the beneficial ownership of the shares transferred to her by two of those siblings belonged to each of them respectively. This is because she knew that those transfers were made pursuant to family arrangements which never eventuated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, the court further examined the resulting trustee’s state of mind under two alternative legal analyses of the transfers of shares to her (at [213]–[214]). Each analysis corresponds to one of the two classical circumstances in which resulting trusts are said to arise according to Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche </span>at 708A–B: see [129] above. Under the first analysis, the resulting trust is said to arise from the failure of an express trust. Such a case, in Chambers’ view, more readily supports fiduciary duties owed by the resulting trustee because she was already in a fiduciary relationship with the settlor-beneficiary as express trustee. Thus, if the transfers of shares in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> were made to set up an express trust (or a non-charitable purpose trust) which subsequently failed, then the trustee would be taken to have undertaken to the settlors to administer the trusts in good faith for the benefit of whoever was to be the beneficiary of the trust and, at the very least, not to do so for her own benefit. Under the second analysis, the resulting trust is said to arise from a gratuitous transfer of property. In such a case, Chambers holds that the resulting trustee’s fiduciary duties generally need not extend beyond those necessary to protect the transferor’s interest in that property. But in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, the trustee was on the facts fully aware that the transferors did not intend her to be the beneficial owner of the shares. She also did not give any indication that she was unwilling to be a trustee of those shares. In any event, the trustee was not an innocent recipient of the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The circumstances in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> relieved the court from having to choose between the two analyses of the resulting trust which arose in that case. On the facts, both analyses led to the conclusion that the resulting trustee was subject to a fiduciary duty to act honestly and in good faith. But it seems to me that even if a case permits the court only one possible way of characterising the resulting trust, the effect of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> is to make that characterisation only a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> indication of the existence of and content of any fiduciary duties to which the resulting trustee is subject, the only decisive inquiry being her conduct and especially her state of mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In my view, while this fact-centric approach is useful for determining the existence of fiduciary duties, particularly in a case which falls somewhere in the middle of Chambers’ scale of resulting trust obligations, there are surely limits to how it can be applied meaningfully to determine even the content of those fiduciary duties. It is not clear to me whether Chambers means to say that in a case at the lower end of his scale of resulting trust obligations, a resulting trustee (a) generally has no fiduciary duties beyond protecting the trust property or (b) could have any number of --fiduciary duties, but their content is generally attenuated by the circumstances of the case. By making the “precise content” of the fiduciary duties owed by a resulting trustee contingent on the circumstances (at [205]), <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> seems to have accepted both (a) and (b). But there are problems of theory and logic with the latter which <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> did not fully explore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 At a theoretical level, even an express trustee – who is the paradigm voluntary acceptor of fiduciary obligations – does not knowingly consent to the “precise content” of the fiduciary duties which she undertakes upon appointment and is obliged to discharge. Consider for example her duty to account. The content of the duty does not originate from the trustees’ explicit or implicit voluntary assumption of the duty. It is surely equity which imposes upon her a duty to keep clear and accurate accounts of the trust property and of her management of it, and to present the accounts at the beneficiary’s request together with supporting documentation: see David Hayton et al, <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton: Law of Trusts and Trustees</span> (LexisNexis, 19th Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Underhill</span>”) at para 56.1. Equity fills the duty to account with this content for two purposes: first, to ensure that the beneficiary is kept apprised of the status of the trust fund and the transformations it has undergone; and second, to ensure that any personal liability which a custodial fiduciary may have as a result of maladministration is ascertained and determined: <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 at [16] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Aedit Abdullah JC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Next, from a logical standpoint, even if the “precise content” of a fiduciary duty owed by a resulting trustee depends on the circumstances, how the circumstances supply content to the duty is itself a legal question. It is the law which decides how an “is” leads to an “ought”. So <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> cannot be read to prescribe a reductionist focus on the facts of the case, eschewing all reference to the established content of fiduciary duties. That would not only create the risk of opaque reasoning by the courts but would also deprive the concept of a fiduciary duty of its normative content. That normative content is determined by the law and is declared and developed by the courts of equity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 If, therefore, a resulting trustee is found to have voluntarily assumed a duty to account, there is no reason to hold that the resulting trustee’s duty to account is any different in content from an express trustee’s duty to account. However, to the extent that there is, I have provided an alternative analysis of the facts of this case on that approach at [210]–[211] below, and it is sufficient to state here that that analysis does not at all change the outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In the light of these principles, I turn to analyse the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ fiduciary relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The parties made their submissions without the benefit of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, as it was handed down too close to the date on which I heard submissions. They have, however, addressed the substance of the issue, which is whether there was a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant which gave rise to fiduciary duties on the defendant’s part. In particular, the plaintiff has proceeded on the basis that he has to show how the defendant acted as if she was his fiduciary

</div> – which is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Tak Yok Koon</span>’s approach of asking whether, based on the resulting trustee’s conduct and state of mind, she can be said to have assumed any fiduciary duties to the beneficiary. In my judgment, there was a fiduciary relationship and the defendant does owe the plaintiff a number of fiduciary duties, including the duty to account for the money she held on resulting trust. There are three principal pieces of evidence which support this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 First, the parties had an ongoing arrangement pursuant to which the defendant undertook to assist the plaintiff in managing and investing the money which he paid her. The defendant admitted that even before she received the first traveller’s cheque for S$460,000 from the plaintiff in December 1993, she had a conversation with the plaintiff and his wife in which they asked her to hold the sum for a suitable property investment.

With the exception of the first US$460,000 which she used to purchase the Shanghai properties, it is not possible to identify which sums she applied to which investment. But the point here is that the plaintiff voluntarily undertook an ongoing arrangement with the defendant to manage and invest his money. Part of that arrangement permitted her to exercise a degree of discretion in managing and investing his money. I find that degree of discretion also to be a relevant consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Second, and this follows naturally from the previous strand of evidence, the plaintiff clearly reposed a high degree of trust in the defendant to manage and invest his money. I draw this inference from a number of facts. The plaintiff paid the defendant the substantial sum of S$3.5m over a period of nearly 15 years. Further, the plaintiff was eager to move his money out of New Zealand, even if only temporarily. He therefore needed a person outside New Zealand whom he could trust to receive the money. That person was the defendant. Finally, the plaintiff said that he treated the defendant like a trustee.

</div> Further, the fact that she retained the records at all implies that she acknowledged a duty to retain them, at least for some time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In the light of this evidence, I find that the defendant knew from the outset of the parties’ arrangement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> from 1993, that the money she was to receive from the plaintiff – and which she actually did receive from the plaintiff over the years – was always to remain beneficially the plaintiff’s and not hers. This satisfies the necessary, albeit insufficient, condition for the existence of fiduciary duties owed by the defendant as a resulting trustee. Next, I find that the defendant was a fiduciary in relation to the defendant on the basis of the arrangement between them under which the defendant would manage and invest his money and on the basis of the trust the plaintiff reposed in her to have dominion over large quantities of his money and the assets in which the money was invested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Accordingly, I find that the defendant at least implicitly undertook from 1993 – and therefore owed and continues to owe the defendant – a number of fiduciary duties in respect of the money which I have found to be the subject of the resulting trust. These include, for the purposes of the present case, the duty to account for the money she received, the duty to act honestly and in good faith, the duty not to profit from the trust property and the duty not to place herself in a position where her personal interest actually conflicts or may conflict with her fiduciary duties. These are among duties which the plaintiff has pleaded that the defendant owes him.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) dated 26 August 2015 at para 24.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I elaborate on the content of these duties when I consider below whether the defendant has breached them in a way which entitles the plaintiff to surmount the applicable limitation period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In deciding that the defendant as resulting trustee owes these fiduciary duties to the plaintiff, I have conceptually placed this resulting trust on the high end of Chambers’ scale of resulting obligations. In accordance with the spirit of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, I do so not primarily because of how I have analysed the resulting trust, which I will come to in a moment, but because of my findings on the defendant’s knowledge concerning the beneficial interest of the money under her charge and her conduct in relation to the plaintiff from 1993 to 2007. It is these facts which have persuaded me that the defendant was effectively acting as a full trustee of the money which she had received from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In addition, although the resulting trust in the present case is a presumed resulting trust – and therefore did not leave property in an express trustee’s hands as a result of a failed express trust – it is not the type of presumed resulting trust which leaves property in the hands of a resulting trustee in the absence of any pre-existing fiduciary relationship and without her knowledge or consent. In fact, the resulting trust in this case arose in quite the opposite circumstances. Therefore, like the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, I do not think that a presumed resulting trust analysis necessarily means that the resulting trustee has absolutely no fiduciary duties or is subject to fiduciary duties with attenuated content. It seems to me that the concept of a presumed resulting trust is relevant mainly for its association in the ordinary case with the absence of a prior fiduciary relationship between the parties before the trust arises. But it would be a mistake to read Chambers’ broad distinction between fiduciary obligations at the higher and lower end of the scale as corresponding strictly to the conceptual distinction between automatic and resulting trusts. Rather, it is the facts which lie behind these trusts which are important and which differ from case to case. Therefore, it is on the facts of this case that I hold the defendant a fiduciary with fiduciary duties of the kind I have enumerated above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Section 6(2) of the Limitation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I turn now to the effect of the Limitation Act on the plaintiff’s case. There are two questions which arise. The first is whether the Limitation Act applies to resulting trusts at all. The second is whether s 6(2) of the Limitation Act applies to a beneficiary’s action for an account. In my judgment, both questions should be answered in the affirmative. I turn now to examine the questions in sequence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the Limitation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The starting point for the first question is s 2(1) of the Limitation Act. That section provides that the word “trust” and “trustee” in the Limitation Act has the same meaning as in the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) (“Trustees Act”). Section 3 of the Trustees Act explains the meaning of those words as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“trust” does not include the duties incident to an estate conveyed by way of mortgage, but with this exception “trust” and “trustee” extend to implied and constructive trusts, and to cases where the trustee has a beneficial interest in the trust property, and to the duties incident to the office of a personal representative, and “trustee’ where the context admits includes a personal representative, and “new trustee” includes and additional trustee </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin H</span><span class="font-italic">oon and others v Tan Choo Suan (in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of Tan Kiam Toen, deceased) and others and other matters</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1150 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon</span>”) I observed that this definition neither mentions nor includes resulting trusts or resulting trustees. I nevertheless took the view that “the weight of authority suggests that resulting trusts are dealt with on the same footing as express and constructive trusts” for the purposes of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act. This was not a live issue in the appeal from my decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span> and the Court of Appeal did not therefore address it in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I note that at least one academic text has suggested a different view, albeit in tentative terms, as a matter of statutory interpretation. Andrew McGee, <span class="font-italic">Limitation Periods </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">McGee</span>”) considers s 68(17) of the Trustee Act 2000 (c 29) (UK) (<span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with the definition of “trust” in s 3 of our Trustees Act) and s 21 of the Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) (“English Limitation Act 1980”) (<span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> pari materia</span> with s 22 of our Limitation Act), and states at para 14.031:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Two problems remain in this area. Section 68(17) of the Trustee Act does not mention trustees holding on a resulting trust. By application of the maxim <span class="font-italic">expressio unius, exclusion alterius</span>, it might be argued that s.21 [of the English Limitation Act 1980] has no application to such trustees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 I respectfully disagree. I hold the same view I did in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon</span>, albeit as a matter of principle and without the benefit of appellate endorsement in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>. Applying <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, I consider that if a resulting trustee voluntarily undertakes the fiduciary duties of an express trustee, and is liable to be sued for breach of those duties, it would be unjust to treat such a trustee differently from an express trustee by withdrawing from her a limitation defence. That is not an effect which I think Parliament intended. Hence, I take the view that such resulting trustees – and I express no view about other resulting trustees – can claim the benefit of the Limitation Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 I do not consider that the <span class="font-italic">expressio unius</span> maxim which <span class="font-italic">McGee</span> relies on prevents me from adopting this interpretation, for two reasons. First, principles of statutory interpretation are not absolute but are merely tools for ascertaining Parliament’s intent. And second, the definition in s 3 of the Trustees Act is an inclusive definition and not an exhaustive one. My interpretation does not, therefore, contradict it. For these reasons, the Limitation Act in my judgment applies to resulting trusts and to resulting trustees. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Beneficiary’s action for an account and s 6(2)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 I turn now to the issue of whether a beneficiary’s action for an account is caught by s 6(2) of the Limitation Act. This is a question of some conceptual importance because it affects what the plaintiff needs to prove in order to obtain an account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I am of the view that the plaintiff’s action is indeed caught by s 6(2). In order to succeed, therefore, he must bring his case within one of the exceptions set out in s 22(1) of Limitation Act. That is something which the plaintiff has failed to do, as will be seen. If, however, I am wrong on this point, then it is within my discretion whether to grant the plaintiff the remedy of an account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Under s 6(2), an action for an account shall not be brought in respect of any matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of the action. An action for an account here refers to an action for relief in the form of an account rendered by a defendant of the administration of property which is under her responsibility: <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General for Ireland </span><span class="font-italic">(at the Relation of McMullen and others) v Dublin Corporation</span> [1824–34] All ER Rep 82 at 86–87 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Redesdale. Such an account is therefore also known as an “account of administration”. That is to be distinguished from accounts for specific equitable wrongdoing (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>an account for secret profit earned as a fiduciary: <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General for Hong Kong v </span><span class="font-italic">Charles Warwick Reid and Others</span> [1994] 1 AC 324 (“<span class="font-italic">Reid</span>”) at 331C <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Templeman): <span class="font-italic">Glazier Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">Pty Ltd v Australian Men’s Health Pty Ltd (No 2)</span> [2001] NSWSC 6 at [36] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Austin J.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Section 6(2) is unusual in that it prescribes a limitation period not by reference to a cause of action but by reference to the remedy sought, regardless of the cause of action. It applies to any action which seeks the remedy of an account of administration. The claim for that remedy could be founded on a right at common law, as in the case of a principal’s action against her agent for an account. Or it could be founded on a right in equity, as in the case of a beneficiary’s action against his trustee for an account. Section 6(7) of the Limitation Act makes clear that s 6(2) applies to the remedy of an account in equity as it does to the remedy of an account at common law, and that it does so regardless of whether the claim for an account in equity is founded on a common law right or an equitable right. Section 6(7) provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(7) Subject to sections 22 and 32, this section shall apply to all claims for specific performance of a contract or for an injunction or for other equitable relief whether the same be founded upon any contract or tort or upon any trust or other ground in equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong</span>”), the Court of Appeal said that “[t]he effect of s 6(7) is that ‘this section’, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the entirety of s 6, applies to all claims for equitable relief, whether these be founded upon contract, tort, <span class="font-italic">a trust</span> or other ground in equity” [emphasis added] (at [69] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sundaresh Menon JA (as the Chief Justice then was)). A beneficiary’s action against his trustee for an account is, therefore, “equitable relief” which is “founded upon … [a] ground in equity” within the meaning of s 6(7). The ground in equity is the trustee’s fiduciary duty to account for the trust property, which is a duty he owes to his beneficiary. That duty alone suffices to entitle the beneficiary to an account without any need to prove a breach of fiduciary duty: <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 339 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng</span>”) at [87] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Chao Hick Tin JA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 I pause here to note that there is one High Court decision – <span class="font-italic">Wong Chong Yue v Wong Chong Thai</span> [2011] 2 SLR 804 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Chong Yue</span>”) – in which Philip Pillai J, having referred to English case law, held that “[a] claim for accounting under an express trust would … not be subject to any time bar, whether under s 6(2) or anywhere else in the Limitation Act” (at [9]). I respectfully decline to follow that approach. That is not because this case concerns a resulting trust and <span class="font-italic">Wong Chong Yue</span> involved an express trust. In this context, in the light of s 6(7), that is a distinction without a difference. I decline to follow the approach in <span class="font-italic">Wong Chong Yue</span> for two reasons. First, <span class="font-italic">Wong Chong Yue</span> was decided before the Court of Appeal unequivocally pronounced in <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong</span> that s 6(7) renders claims for all equitable relief, even those founded on a trust, subject to the limitation provisions in s 6. As a matter of authority, therefore, the view in <span class="font-italic">Wong Chong Yue</span> has been superseded to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Court of Appeal’s view in <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong</span>. Second, as I shall explain at [179]–[185] below, the English position on whether a beneficiary’s action for an account is limited by time is, as a matter of statute and case law, in fact different from the Singapore position. So the English cases cannot be taken to set out the position in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Accordingly, the six-year limitation period in s 6(2) of the Limitation Act applies to a beneficiary’s action against a trustee for an account unless the beneficiary can bring himself within one of the exceptions set out in s 22 of the Limitation Act. So if the plaintiff in this case cannot bring himself within those exceptions, he can obtain an account only of the defendant’s dealings with trust property which she received in the six years before he commenced this action. Given that the plaintiff filed this suit on 28 April 2014, the six-year period in question would run from 28 April 2008 to 27 April 2014, both dates inclusive: (see s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed))<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 That this is how the limitation period operates in respect of an action for an account is not in doubt. It is also the basis upon which the parties in this case have proceeded.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) said in <span class="font-italic">Ang Toon Teck v Ang Poon Sin</span> [1998] SGHC 67 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Toon Teck</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [65]–[67]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I agree with the submission made on behalf of the defendant that any order in respect of the monies should properly be for an account of monies belonging to the patriarch’s estate which were received by the defendant as a trustee. This being the case, one has to look at s 6(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) (‘the Act’) which states that ‘an action for an account shall not be brought in respect of any matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of the action’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The plaintiff argued that even if s 6(2) applied to this case, his claims were not time barred because the action was commenced on 14 June 1995 which was only 14 months after the beneficiaries had demanded that the defendant render them accounts. He obviously took the position that time starts to count from the date of the demand for accounts. This does not, however, appear to the legal position.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Preston &amp; Newsom’s Limitation of Actions</span> [3rd Ed] states at p 56:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">‘The cause of action for an account arises when the defendant has assets of the plaintiff in his hands in respect of which he is liable to account. Normally, he is so liable, if at all, from the moment he receives them</span>; but there may be circumstances in which the express agreement between them is that he is only to be accountable at some later date or where the court can infer such an arrangement (<span class="font-italic">Topham v Braddick</span> [1809] 1 Taunt. 571 …’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 This must be correct. Liability to account arises upon receipt of the trust property. Time for the purposes of s 6(2) must therefore also begin to run upon receipt. This approach is consistent with how the limitation period for an action for an account is understood in other areas of substantive law as well. For example, in the law of partnership, the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Brownlow William Knox v Frederick Gye </span>(1871) LR 5 HL 656 held that the defence of limitation applied to a suit brought by an executor of a deceased partner against the surviving partner demanding an account of the partnership concerns, and that “in the general case, the <span class="font-italic">punctum temporis</span> from which the statutory period of six years begins to run, is the date at which the partnership estate came to be <span class="font-italic">vested</span> in the surviving partner” [emphasis added] (at 677–678 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Colonsay). This passage was cited with approval by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lai Hoon Woon (executor and trustee of the estate of Lai Thai Lok, deceased) v Lai Foong Sin and another</span> [2016] SGHC 113 at [262] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Kannan Ramesh JC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 It might be thought that this position causes difficulties. A trustee of an express trust settled more than six years ago – and who was therefore vested with all of the trust property outside the limitation period – might rely on this principle to argue that her beneficiary’s action for an account is time-barred. But that argument would not succeed. In the ordinary case, the express trustee continues to hold that property. The property would still be in the trustee’s “possession” within the meaning of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The beneficiary would therefore be within an exception to the time bar. In the unfortunate case where the trustee has dealt fraudulently with the property or has converted it to her own use, the beneficiary would again be within an exception to the time bar under either s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The only case in which the beneficiary would find his action for an account time-barred would be where it appears that the trust property has left hands of the trustee innocently, and there is no evidence to the contrary. As I shall suggest below at [188], it is perfectly sensible for Parliament to have intended that a trustee in this situation ought not to be put to undue expense in having to give an account of something he no longer has in his possession, when the beneficiary had every reasonable opportunity to compel him to do so within the limitation period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 I turn now to the present case. It is common ground that the defendant did not receive any trust property during the period six years before the plaintiff commenced this suit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> from 28 April 2008 to 27 April 2014. Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim for an account of the money he paid to her from 1993 to 2007 is time-barred under s 6(2) unless he can bring his case within s 22(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 If, however, I am wrong on the scope of s 6(7), the other possible position is that a beneficiary’s action for an account is not subject to any limitation period at all. This appears to be the position in English law, at least in relation to express trusts: see <span class="font-italic">Underhill</span> at para 94.34. I say “appears” because there is an ongoing controversy over whether a beneficiary’s action for an account is an “action for an account” within the meaning of s 23 of the English Limitation Act 1980 (the counterpart to s 6(2) of our Limitation Act): William Swadling, “Limitation” in Peter Birks and Arianna Pretto, <span class="font-italic">Breach of Trust</span> (Hart Publishing, 2002) (“<span class="font-italic">Swadling</span>”) at p 335. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 At least one English case has been decided on the assumption that s 23 of the English Limitation Act 1980 applies to a beneficiary’s action for an account: <span class="font-italic">In re Howlett </span><span class="font-italic">(William Henry) (Dec’d)</span> [1949] 1 Ch 767 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Howlett</span>”). But the weight of English authority suggests the English equivalent of s 6(2) applies only to actions for an account founded on common law legal rights: <span class="font-italic">Paragon </span><span class="font-italic">Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; Co </span>[1999] 1 All ER 400 (“<span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance</span>”) at 415<span class="font-italic">h</span>–416<span class="font-italic">b</span> <span class="font-italic">per</span> Millett LJ. That would leave an action such as this one, under English law, subject to no limitation period at all. The only qualification in English law is that, where all of a beneficiary’s other claims against a trustee are time-barred, an English court will not order an account if the account would serve no useful purpose: <span class="font-italic">Barnett</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Creggy</span> [2014] EWHC 3080 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Barnett</span>”) at [82] <span class="font-italic">per</span> David Richards J. The practical effect is that English law by a different process achieves very nearly the same result as Singapore law. The rationale for this result is relevant to this case and is best appreciated from a historical perspective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The time bar in English law for actions for an account originated as a manifestation of what William Swadling has called the “no side-stepping rule”: <span class="font-italic">Swadling</span> at p 323. That rule stipulated that, where the courts of equity had concurrent and auxiliary jurisdictions over a claim with the courts of common law, the claimant could not “side-step” a common law limitation period by suing in equity’s exclusive jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">Lockey v Lockey</span> (1719) Prec Ch 518. The rule survived the fusion of the administration of common law and equity in the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 and was crystallised legislatively in s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Trustee Act 1888 (c 59) (UK) (“English Trustee Act 1888”). And it was clear that s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) did not impose a time bar on a beneficiary’s action for an account. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Re Richardson</span> [1919] 2 Ch 50, the court ordered an account without limit of time so that the beneficiary could ascertain the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Nevertheless, a practice emerged by which a defendant trustee could, by proving that there was no fraudulent breach of trust beyond six years before the action was commenced, persuade the court to restrict the temporal scope of the account:<span class="font-italic"> Re Williams</span> [1916] 2 Ch 38. As no genuine purpose would be served by an account in such a case, the court would order an account limited to trust property in the trustee’s hands within six years before the action was commenced and of other trust property that came to the trustee in the same period:<span class="font-italic"> How v Earl Winterton</span> [1896] 2 Ch 626. Effectively, the courts sought to relieve the trustee from the costly undertaking of providing an account if it was persuaded that the beneficiary had no real prospect of surmounting the time bar applicable to innocent breaches of trust (then s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Trustee Act 1888 and now s 22(3) of English Limitation Act 1980). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 This result was explained by Preston and Newsom in their text, <span class="font-italic">Limitation of Actions</span>, which Prakash J cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ang Toon Teck </span>at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Preston &amp; Newsom’s Limitation of Actions also states at p 184 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the <span class="font-italic">absence of fraud</span>, the <span class="font-italic">practical effect</span> is that a beneficiary will be entitled to an account against a trustee (a) of all moneys received by him within six years, as in the case of any other accounting party, and (b) of all moneys in his hands within the six years, under s 19(1) (<span class="font-italic">How v Winterton (Earl)</span> [1896] 2 Ch 626).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 English law nevertheless maintained in theory a beneficiary’s perpetual entitlement to bring an action for an account. Section 2(2) of the Limitation Act 1939 (c 21) (UK) (“English Limitation Act 1939”) enacted for the first time a six-year time bar specifically for actions for an account. Section 2(2) is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 6(2) of our Limitation Act. Significantly, s 2(7) of the English Limitation Act 1939 effectively disapplied s 2 to claims for equitable relief except in certain limited cases:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This section <span class="font-italic">shall not apply </span>to any claim for specific performance of a contract or for an injunction or for other equitable relief, except in so far as any provision thereof may be applied by the court by analogy in like manner as the corresponding enactment repealed by this Act has heretofore been applied. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, s 2(7) of the English Limitation Act 1939 is framed in quite the opposite way to s 6(7) of our Limitation Act: see [171] above. Our section sets out the classes of case to which s 6 “<span class="font-italic">shall</span> apply” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Tito </span><span class="font-italic">and Others v Waddell and Others (No 2)</span> [1977] 1 Ch 106 (“<span class="font-italic">Tito v Waddell</span>”) at 250D–251F, Megarry V-C held <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that the combined effect of ss 2(2) and 2(7) of the English Limitation Act 1939 was to bar claims for an equitable account where the underlying cause of action was breach of contract, but not to bar claims against what might be called “pure” fiduciaries, such as trustees. Section 2(7) of the English Limitation Act 1939 has been preserved in s 36(1) of the English Limitation Act 1980, which is the limitation statute in force in England today. So the position in England has remained unchanged to the present day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Yet, in English law, judicial discretion continues to temper the beneficiary’s perpetual right to an account. Thus in <span class="font-italic">Barnett </span>at [82], David Richards J took the view that where all other actions by a beneficiary against a trustee are time-barred, the court will not grant an order for an account unless such an order would serve a “useful purpose”. So too, in Singapore, George Wei J accepted that a beneficiary who would otherwise be entitled to an account may be denied the remedy where “it would be oppressive to require the [fiduciary] to so account, or for some other good reason, the court in its discretion thinks it wrong to make an order”: <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Foo Jhee Tuang and others</span> [2016] SGHC 260 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>”) at [81] <span class="font-italic">per</span> George Wei J, citing <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Cocke</span><span class="font-italic"> and Another </span>[1988] Ch 414 at 420H <span class="font-italic">per</span> Harman J.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The law in this area reflects a balance struck between two competing interests. The first is the beneficiary’s right to an account of trust property. That right is free-standing in the sense that it subsists without any breach of fiduciary duty: <span class="font-italic">Underhill</span> at para 94.34. Further, a trustee has a “continuing duty” to account: <span class="font-italic">Chiang Shirley v Chiang Dong Pheng </span>[2015] 3 SLR 770 at [88] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Judith Prakash J (as she then was). A beneficiary should therefore be entitled to the remedy of an account as long he retains his status as a beneficiary; after all, the account is the central mechanism by which the trustee is held accountable. This is doubtless a reflection of the ancient rule, developed by the courts of Chancery, that in the absence of laches or acquiescence, an express trustee is accountable without limit of time: see <span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance </span>at 408<span class="font-italic">f</span> <span class="font-italic">per</span> Millett LJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The second competing interest is the desire not to subject a trustee to the burden of having to give an account of a trust when it would operate oppressively or would serve no useful purpose. By enacting s 6(7) of the Limitation Act, Parliament seems to have entrenched the latter as decisive in a case where all other actions by a beneficiary are time-barred. But even if my view of s 6(7) is wrong, balancing these two competing interests is still the objective of the discretionary exercise contemplated by <span class="font-italic">Barnett</span> and <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>. Therefore, even if s 6(2) of the Limitation Act does not apply to the plaintiff’s action, the question whether to order an account in his favour is still a matter of judicial discretion, which I must exercise according to the parameters set out in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>. This is an alternative analysis I undertake below after examining the plaintiff’s case under s 22(1) of Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Section 22(1) of the Limitation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Beneficiary’s action for an account and s 22(1) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Before I examine and apply the criteria under each exception in s 22(1), it is necessary first to explain the relationship between a beneficiary’s action for an account and s 22(1). This is not an entirely straightforward matter for three reasons. The first is this. A beneficiary’s action for an account in respect of matters arising up to six years before the action may be founded purely on the trustee’s duty to account without any need to assert any other claim against the trustee. But a beneficiary’s action for an account in respect of matters arising more than six years before the action cannot be founded purely on the trustee’s duty to account. The beneficiary must successfully bring a claim which falls within s 22(1) and then seek, as a form of relief for that claim, an account of the trust property. That is the effect of ss 6(2) and 6(7).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Second, the position is complicated by the fact that not all beneficiaries who seek an account are seeking that account from a trustee of an express trust or who is subject to the irreducible core duties of an express trustee. If, as in the present case, the trust in question is a resulting trust, then the beneficiary must first establish under the <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> test<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the resulting trustee owes him a duty to account in order even to be entitled <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>to the remedy of an account. And if he relies on s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), he must also establish under the <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> test that the resulting trustee owes him the fiduciary duty which the beneficiary alleges that the trustee has breached fraudulently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Third, the position is further complicated by the fact that there are two forms of account, the stricter of which may be ordered only upon the court’s being satisfied of certain additional conditions. The two forms of account are the common account and the account taken on the footing of wilful default: H G Hanbury, “Forms of account against executors and trustees” (1936) 52 LQR 365 (“<span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa</span><span class="font-italic"> and Others </span>[2005] SGCA 4 at [55] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Judith Prakash J (as she then was). The difference between the two is the basis upon which the account is taken. An order for a common account requires the trustee to account for the property she has received and how it has been applied. An order for an account on the footing of wilful default requires the trustee to account not only for what she has received and how it has been applied, but also for what she might have received had it not been for her “wilful default”. Because the account on the footing of wilful default is stricter, additional requirements must be met before the court will order a trustee to account on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Bearing these considerations in mind, I now summarise the general position of a beneficiary who seeks an account from his trustee: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To obtain an account on the common basis in respect of matters no more than six years before the action was commenced, a beneficiary simply needs to establish that his trustee owes him a duty to account: <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng </span>at [87] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Chao Hick Tin JA; <span class="font-italic">Panweld Trading Pte Ltd v Yong Kheng Leong</span><span class="font-italic"> and others (Loh Yong Lim, third party) </span>[2012] 2 SLR 672 at [60] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Steven Chong J (as he then was). In the case of an express trust, this is axiomatic. In the case of a resulting trust, the beneficiary must show that the resulting trustee is subject to a duty to account on the <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> test (at [206]). No breach of trust or wilful default needs to be shown because the order for an account “supposes no misconduct”: <span class="font-italic">Partington v Reynolds </span>(1858) 4 Drew 253 at 256 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Kindersley V-C. Once the beneficiary establishes that he is owed a duty to account, the court will order a common account unless such an order would be oppressive to require the fiduciary to account or the court considers in its discretion that it would be wrong to do so for some other good reason not to grant it: <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span> at [81] <span class="font-italic">per</span> George Wei J.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To obtain an account on the common basis in respect of matters more than six years before the action was commenced, a beneficiary must bring an action which is within the scope of the exceptions in s 22(1) of the Limitation Act: <span class="font-italic">Ang Tin Gee</span><span class="font-italic"> v Pang Teck Guan </span>[2011] SGHC 259 at [112]–[117] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Belinda Ang J. He must also, if it is not an express trust, establish that the trustee owes him a duty to account. If the action succeeds, the beneficiary may seek an order for a common account as his remedy. The court may then, in its discretion, grant the order.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To obtain an account on the basis of wilful default in respect of matters no more than six years before the action was commenced, a beneficiary must establish that the trustee has committed at least one instance of wilful default which has caused loss to the trust property: <span class="font-italic">Re Tebbs</span><span class="font-italic"> (deceased); Redfern v Tebbs and another </span>[1976] 1 All ER 858 at 863 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Slade J; <span class="font-italic">Re Ellis</span> [2015] WASC 77 at [132] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Heenan J. A breach of trust may amount to a wilful default, but not necessarily: <span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Wrightson; Wrightson v Cooke</span> [1908] 1 Ch 789 at 799 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Warrington J; <span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span> at p 368; <span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; others v Barclays Bank Trust</span> <span class="font-italic">Co Ltd (No 2)</span> [1980] 2 All ER 92 at 97 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Brightman LJ. Because the two concepts are not co-extensive, a beneficiary cannot secure an account on the wilful default basis simply by establishing that the trustee has committed a breach of trust: <span class="font-italic">Meehan v Glazier Holdings Pty Ltd </span>(2002) 54 NSWLR 146 at [65]–[66] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Giles JA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) To obtain an account on the basis of wilful default in respect of matters more than six years before the action was commenced, a beneficiary must bring an action which is within the scope of the exceptions in s 22(1) of the Limitation Act. In addition, the beneficiary must establish that the trustee has committed at least one instance of wilful default which has caused loss to the trust property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The plaintiff does not seek an account on the wilful default basis. And the account which the plaintiff seeks goes back to the day on which the plaintiff received each of his payments to her, all of which she received more than six years before he commenced this action. So the present case is concerned with the second of the four positions I have just described.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I turn now to consider the requirements under each limb of s 22(1) of the Limitation Act before applying them to the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fraud or fraudulent breach of trust</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Section 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limitation of actions in respect of trust property</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22.—(1) No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy; or …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The meaning of “fraud” and “fraudulent” for the purposes of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is well established.

This test requires that: (a) the defendant’s conduct must be dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people; and (b) the defendant himself must have realised that by those standards his conduct was dishonest. Hence, it appears that whereas the content of “fraud” is to be derived from Millett LJ’s definition in <span class="font-italic">Armitage</span>, the perspective from which the central concept of dishonesty should be assessed is informed by Lord Hutton’s test in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>. That is how the Court of Appeal’s approval of both tests in <span class="font-italic">Panweld</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> for the purposes of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) might be meaningfully rationalised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 I am aware that in <span class="font-italic">Lim Siew Bee v Lim Boh Chuan</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2014] SGHC 41 Belinda Ang J gave a different explanation of the meaning of “fraud” in s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act. Relying on Lord Denning MR’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Applegate v Moss</span> [1971] 1 QB 406 (“<span class="font-italic">Applegate</span>”) at 413C,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ang J said at [112] that “fraud” in the context of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) means “conduct of the defendant … [which] has been such as to hide from the plaintiff the existence of his right of action, in such circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow the defendant to rely on the lapse of time as a bar to the claim.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I respectfully disagree with Ang J’s definition of fraud. Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">Applegate</span> was actually explaining what “concealed fraud” meant under s 26(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1939, which later became s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1980, and which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of our Limitation Act. That provision postpones the applicable limitation period where the plaintiff’s right of action is concealed by the fraud of the defendant or his agent. However, Millett LJ makes it clear in <span class="font-italic">Armitage </span>at 260H that this special concept of concealed fraud does not affect the meaning of fraud in the general sense as it is used in s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of English Limitation Act 1980:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The meaning of the words “fraud” and “fraudulent” in section 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is not distorted by the meaning of the expression “concealed fraud” formerly used in s 26 of the Act of 1939 and which was given a very special meaning but has been replaced in the Act of 1980 by the more accurate expression “deliberate concealment.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 The other issue relating to s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act is whether it requires fraud to be an element of the plaintiff’s cause of action. There seems to be a near consensus in the textbooks that it does: Terence Prime and Gary Scanlan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Limitation </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2001) (“<span class="font-italic">Prime and </span><span class="font-italic">Scanlan</span>”) at p 294; David Oughton, John Lowry and Robert Merkin, <span class="font-italic">Limitation of Actions</span> (Lloyd’s Commercial Law Library, 1998) at p 373. <span class="font-italic">McGee</span> ([165] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at para 14.005 takes a more tentative view in the affirmative, albeit without explanation. All the textbooks simply cite <span class="font-italic">Armitage</span> as authority for that view.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 I have my doubts about whether that view is correct. In <span class="font-italic">Armitage</span> at 260, Millett LJ observes that s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1980 (no limitation period for action by beneficiary in respect of fraud) originates from the predecessor to s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1980 (postponement of limitation period for action based upon fraud). Because the cases on the latter provision require fraud to be an element of the cause of action, so also, Millett LJ reasons, must fraud be an element of the cause of action under s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). I do not think this follows, for three reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whereas s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1980 and its Singapore equivalent, s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, use the words “based upon … fraud”, s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1980 and its Singapore equivalent, s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, use the words “in respect of fraud”. “Based upon” suggests fraud as the very basis of the action, whereas “in respect of” suggests it suffices if fraud is present even if it is not an element of the cause of action. None of the textbooks seem to have noticed the significance of this difference in wording.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the alternative trigger for the exception in s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is “an action in respect of any … fraudulent breach of trust …”.  That suggests that the beneficiary has first to establish a breach of trust (which would be the cause of action), and then establish that the breach was committed fraudulently (which is here a statutory requirement to operate the exception, separate from the cause of action).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, a breach of trust as a cause of action has no fixed set of elements. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Tito v Waddell</span>, Megarry V-C famously declined to decide on the meaning of breach of trust under the predecessor of s 21 of the English Limitation Act 1980. That is quite unlike, say, a cause of action in tort such as conversion or a cause of action for breach of contract where the elements of the cause of action are generally well established. The point here is that in all cases, whether there is a breach of trust is highly fact-dependent: see <span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Chapman; Cockes v Chapman</span> [1896] 2 Ch 763 at 774 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lindley LJ and 780 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lopes LJ. Sometimes “fraud” is necessary, sometimes it is simply present.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Bearing these considerations in mind, it appears to me that for the purposes of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the better view is to ask whether a breach of trust has been established and, if so, whether it is “fraudulent” within the meaning of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) rather than to ask whether fraud is an “element” of the beneficiary’s cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I turn now to consider whether the plaintiff has brought his case within s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff’s arguments are best analysed according to the different fiduciary duties which he has alleged that the defendant has breached. For the reasons below, the plaintiff has failed to establish any of his allegations of fraudulent breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Duty to account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 The plaintiff submits that the defendant breached her duty to account for all of the sums which I have found she received.

</div>
</div> I have found that she does owe the plaintiff a duty to account: see [159] above. There are two possible analyses of this breach in view of my analysis on how the court should determine the content of that duty: see<span class="font-italic"> </span>[140] and [146]–[148] above. On both analyses, however, I find that the plaintiff fails to come within s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 On the first analysis, the content of the defendant's duty to account is precisely the same as that of an express trustee. The basis for that is that she voluntarily assumed a duty to account to the plaintiff and the law steps in to supply the content of that duty. Equity requires every trustee to keep clear and accurate accounts of the trust property and of her management of it, and to present them to the beneficiary at his request together with supporting documentation: see [147] above. Satisfying the latter aspect of this duty requires an account in the sense of formal accounts, not in the sense of an informal explanation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 If this analysis is correct, the defendant has undoubtedly breached her duty to account. I have found that the defendant did receive substantial sums of money from the plaintiff between 1993 and 2007. There is no evidence that the defendant ever kept proper accounts of how she dealt with these sums, let alone that she ever prepared for and presented to the plaintiff formal accounts of how she did so.

</div> Indeed, the defendant does not even suggest that she did. The defendant’s only explanation is what records she kept of her dealings with sums she received from the plaintiff were disposed of during a spring cleaning exercise a few years before 2012, which is when the plaintiff started asking for those records.

</div> But the defendant’s duty to account is a continuing duty. Those records were essential for her to discharge her duty to account. Disposing of those records rendered her permanently incapable of discharging that duty and is, in itself, a further aspect of her breach of that duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Consequently, her approach in these proceedings towards demonstrating that she had “accounted” for the sums she received was fundamentally flawed. It consisted not in showing how over the years she had documented for the plaintiff how she had received and managed the sums she received from him. Rather, it was an attempt to show how the limited amount of primary evidence which remains intact, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e </span>copies of cheques and bank statements, considered together with a circumspect interpretation of Mr Leow’s expert report, supports the explanation which she is now giving of the sums she received and what she did with them.

</div> These were reconstructive explanations after the fact. They served only to re-emphasise that the defendant did not discharge her duty to account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Having said this, I do not find that the defendant’s breach of her duty to account – on this analysis of the content of that duty – was fraudulent. It is important to note that the plaintiff does not submit that the defendant committed this breach dishonestly in the <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> sense. The plaintiff does not suggest that the defendant subjectively believed her failure to account from 1993 to 2007 was dishonest. Further, her evidence is that she disposed of her means to account some time before the plaintiff commenced this action. There is no suggestion that the defendant disposed of those records otherwise than in the course of a routine spring-cleaning exercise and otherwise than because she believed she no longer needed to render an account to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant breached her duty to account fraudulently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The plaintiff’s case on the duty to account is simply that the defendant never rendered a proper account and that the account which she now attempts to provide is inadequate.

</div> The plaintiff can show only that the defendant’s memory now of what she did with the plaintiff’s money does not square with Mr Leow’s figures or with some of the available documentary evidence. That does not justify an inference that the defendant fraudulently or dishonestly failed account for the trust property. In fact, the plaintiff’s supplementary submissions, which deal exclusively with the requirements of s 22(1) of the Limitation Act, do not allege that the defendant’s breach of her duty to account was a fraudulent breach of trust.

</div> These submissions raise other alleged breaches, mainly concerning the duty of a trustee not to place herself in a position where her personal interest conflicts or may conflict with her duty. I consider these allegations in the next section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 I turn to the alternative analysis of the content of the defendant’s duty to account.

On this less stringent analysis, I find that there has been no breach of duty in the first place, let alone one which is fraudulent. I accept the defendant’s explanation that one reason for her failure to keep proper accounts was that she conducted business in the “Chinese way”.

</div>
</div> This was the reason the defendant offered for not properly documenting the payments made in the first purchase of the GK Holding shares. I take the defendant’s explanation to mean that she dealt with the plaintiff’s money informally, in reliance on oral arrangements and understandings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 That degree of informality is very common in dealings between family members, regardless of their ethnic group. I therefore accept that there was a degree of mutual informality between the plaintiff and the defendant in how the defendant was expected to account to him for his money and investments. On this analysis of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, the plaintiff must show that the defendant assumed a duty to render formal accounts to the plaintiff. Having examined the evidence on the defendant’s fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff at [151]–[159] above, I find that the plaintiff has not discharged this burden. On this alternative analysis of the content of the defendant’s duty to account, therefore, I would have found there to be no duty to keep proper accounts and to render formal accounts at all. The question of breach of duty, and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> fraudulent breach of duty, therefore does not even arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conflict of interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The plaintiff submits that the defendant breached her duty not to place herself in a position where her personal interest conflicts or may conflict with her fiduciary duties to the plaintiff. I have found that the no conflict duty, as I shall call it, does apply to the defendant: see [159] above. The general effect of this duty is that a trustee is not allowed to derive any personal advantage from the administration of the trust property that is not expressly authorised: Lynton Tucker et al, <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span> (Sweet and Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewin</span>”) at para 20-001; <span class="font-italic">George </span><span class="font-italic">Bray v John Rawlinson Ford</span> [1896] AC 44 at 51 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Herschell. If a trustee breaches the no conflict duty, she will be strictly liable to account for the profit derived from the breach, of which she will be a constructive trustee: <span class="font-italic">Reid</span> ([170] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 331C–E <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Templeman.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 I should say that I do not think that the content of the no conflict duty is susceptible to an alternative analysis in the way I have analysed the content of the duty to account. This is because of the binary nature of the no conflict duty: there is either a conflict or there is no conflict; and if there is a conflict, there is either authorisation or no authorisation. So there is no sensible scope for an alternative analysis involving the determination of the “precise content” of the no conflict duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The plaintiff alleges four principal breaches of the no conflict duty on the part of the defendant. I examine each of them in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 The first alleged breach of the no conflict duty is connected to the defendant’s personal business interests. The plaintiff’s position on this allegation is not consistent. In his pleadings, he states that the defendant breached the duty by allowing Heng Management, her firm, to carry out book-keeping services for GK Holding and by overcharging GK Holding for those services after she had invested the plaintiff’s money in GK Holding.

</div> The defendant’s submission implies that these allegations are incapable of amounting to a breach of the fiduciary duties which the defendant owed to the plaintiff as a resulting trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 The defendant is correct. At no point in time did she hold the plaintiff’s shares in GK Holding on any sort of trust for him. The first tranche of shares in GK Holding were indeed purchased with the plaintiff’s money. But those shares were transferred immediately and directly into his name. Not only legal title but absolute title to those shares thereby vested in him.

</div>
</div>
</div> With that, the defendant’s status as a resulting trustee of the purchase money for those shares ceased, as did any fiduciary duties she owed the plaintiff under that resulting trust. So the only possible breach of the no conflict duty in relation to the first tranche is in the very fact that the defendant directed trust money into shares in GK Holding in the first place. But it is not the plaintiff’s pleaded or argued case that that amounted to a breach of any of her fiduciary duties to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 The defendant was equally never the trustee of the second tranche of shares in GK Holding which the plaintiff acquired. In fact, on the available evidence – mainly from the defendant – the defendant and her sisters-in-law may have paid for his shares first: see [223] below. So it could plausibly be argued that the plaintiff was a resulting trustee of those shares for them. And again, it is not the plaintiff’s case that the defendant breached the no conflict duty simply by making the investment in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 My rejection of this alleged breach of the no conflict duty is supported by a passage in <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> at para 20-051 which addresses the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> of a beneficiary where a trustee derives a profit from a company in which the trust is interested:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a case where the trust fund comprises shares in a company and a trustee who is a director of the company derives a profit from the company, it is necessary to consider whether the beneficiary has <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to pursue a claim in respect of the profit. The profit may be one which the trustee in his capacity as director is authorised to retain as between himself and the company, yet be one for which the trustee in his capacity as trustee is liable to account to the trust fund, for instance director’s fees paid by the company. In such a case there is no doubt that a beneficiary of the trust has <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to pursue a claim against the trustee in his capacity as such: the beneficiaries are the only persons who have a claim and the company has none. The profit may, however, be one that the trustee is unauthorised to retain, in whole or in part, both as between himself in his capacity as director and the company, and as between himself in his capacity as trustee and the beneficiaries. If so, there are, potentially, claims by both the company and the beneficiaries, and the question arises whether a claim by a beneficiary is precluded by the reflective loss principle that a person interested in a company through a shareholding in the company cannot bring a claim in respect of an injury to the company merely because the value of the shareholding is prejudiced by that injury. A claim by a beneficiary in respect of the profit is not precluded by the reflective loss principle unless it can be shown by the defendant trustee that (i) the whole of the claimed profit reflects what the company has lost and what it has a cause of action to recover and (ii) such a claim is available on the facts. Hence, if the profit is one that the trustee is or may be entitled to retain as to part in his capacity as director, but not in his capacity as trustee, a beneficiary may bring a claim in respect of the profit, though his claim will be subject to the company’s claim (if brought) to recover the profit so far as due to be restored to the company. Similar considerations apply where the trustee is not a director of the company but has some other capacity in relation to the company which imposes on him fiduciary duties to the company as well as to the beneficiaries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 It will be appreciated that the issues relating to the beneficiary’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> discussed in the passage above arise only when the trustee of his shares is concurrently a director of the company in which those shares are held. That situation raises issues of (a) whether the beneficiary has <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> as beneficiary to sue the trustee-director and (b) whether, even if he has <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>, he would be precluded by the principle of reflective loss from suing her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Since the defendant in the present case was never a trustee of any of the plaintiff’s shares in GK Holding, her position is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> of all of the various scenarios which are contemplated in the passage from <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> cited above. The plaintiff as beneficiary has no <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to sue the defendant for conduct in relation to GK Holding after he became a shareholder and is bound strictly by the principle of reflective loss if he wishes to recover a loss in the value of his shares by reason of her conduct. A claim on that footing is not, in any event, particularised in his pleadings. And the plaintiff cannot complain that he is thereby left without a remedy, because he had rights as a shareholder of GK Holding which he could have exercised to obtain a suitable remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 But even if the plaintiff had argued that the defendant as trustee breached the no conflict duty simply by directing the plaintiff’s money into GK Holding, I would have rejected that argument. There is no evidence that the defendant had any personal dealings with GK Holding at the time the plaintiff acquired his first tranche of shares in 1994/1995. The earliest instance of the defendant’s personal dealings with GK Holding appears to be Yi Kang Food &amp; Beverage, which was established in 1998 as a sole proprietorship

</div> The plaintiff has characterised the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff became indebted to her as a result of this purchase a “fictitious loan”. But he could not seriously question the authenticity of the five cheques. Neither did he dispute the figure of S$835,000. Indeed, he relies on that very figure to argue that the defendant, in breach of the no conflict duty obtained a better price in that purchase for her own shares. I deal with that argument below. In the result, the plaintiff has not proved on the balance of probabilities that the defendant used trust money to make the second purchase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 But even if the second purchase was made with trust money, I would have, for two reasons, found that the defendant did not breach the no conflict duty because the plaintiff authorised the investment even though she had by then dealings with GK Holding in her personal capacity. First, there is objective evidence, in the form of a handwritten note, to show that the defendant discussed that investment with the plaintiff and provided him an analysis of the costs.

</div> In any event, on the merits of the allegation itself, the mere fact that one account of the defendant was overdrawn at one point in time does not prove – or even justify an inference – that the defendant did not have the means to make these investments from her own resources. The plaintiff has failed to prove that she used trust money for her own investments, let alone that she did so fraudulently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Second, the plaintiff points to the fact that he paid more per share when he acquired the second tranche of his GK Holding shares than the defendant did.  He paid S$835,000 for 15% of the company while the defendant paid only S$315,000 for 20% of the company. The plaintiff submits that this shows that the defendant was dishonest in her dealings with the plaintiff because it was the defendant who arranged the purchase of the second tranche.

</div> I reject this submission. I accept the defendant’s evidence that part of the purchase consideration which she gave for the 20% of GK Holding which she acquired was not paid in cash but was her agreement to take over liability for a personal guarantee in the sum of S$6.5m for the company’s debts. The plaintiff has produced no evidence to contradict this assertion. Further, Mr Leow accepted in cross-examination that it was possible to provide part of the purchase consideration for a tranche of shares in this manner.

</div> In any event, it is misconceived. Even if it were true, those dividends were due to the plaintiff in his capacity as the absolute owner of shares in GK Holding. The dividends arise from his shares, and are not any part of and do not arise from the money which the defendant held on resulting trust for the plaintiff. So the plaintiff’s proper remedy for any failure to receive these dividends lies in his rights as a shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In any event, there is no evidence for this allegation. The defendant’s case is that she simply set off the dividends due to him against a debt which the plaintiff owed to her and her sisters-in-law and another debt which he owed to GK Holding. The former debt arose when the defendant and her sisters-in-law paid, on behalf of the plaintiff, the purchase price of S$835,000 for his second tranche of shares in GK Holding:

She acceded by causing GK Holding to extend a loan to the plaintiff. At the same time, the company extended proportionate loans to Teo Chye Har and the defendant.

</div> There is no evidence of any such sale. This sale features nowhere in the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief.

I find that the purpose stated in the acknowledgment was the true reason for the payment and that it resulted in the plaintiff being indebted to GK Holding in the sum of S$262,500.

</div> This seems correct. In <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong</span>, a director of a company was held to have misappropriated the company’s funds by causing the company to pay his wife a salary even though the wife provided no services to the company in return. The court said <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that the money which he had misappropriated in this way was still in his “possession” within the meaning of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) even though it had been “parked” with his wife (at [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As for s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), if, as we think is the case, the Judge had made a finding that Mdm Lim was merely a proxy … then Mr Yong would equally be caught by this section. For all intents and purposes, and in substance, the misappropriated funds were in Mr Yong’s possession or for his benefit. It ought not to make a difference that the funds were parked with his wife. The court in <span class="font-italic">Gwembe Valley</span> made similar observations about the irrelevance of the director having parked the secret profits in his other company. … Nonetheless, there is no need for us to reach a final conclusion on this because as noted in [53] above, Mr Yong had acted fraudulently as a Class 1 constructive trustee and that would be sufficient to deny him the limitation defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 The principle therefore seems to be that where the trust property or its proceeds are tangible, or can readily be rendered into the direct possession or actual control of the trustee, the requirement of “possession” in s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is satisfied: <span class="font-italic">Prime and Scanlan</span> at p 297.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 A further illustration is <span class="font-italic">Thorn v Heard and Marsh </span>[1894] 1 Ch 599. In that case, the mortgage money which the beneficiary was seeking to recover was never in the trustee’s hands. Instead, the trustee’s solicitor had wrongfully retained the money and dissipated it. The case was decided under the English Trustee Act 1888, the relevant provision of which turned on the concept of continued retention rather than continued possession. But I do not consider there to be a distinction of substance between the two concepts for present purposes. The beneficiary argued in that case that the trustee had a legal entitlement to call on the solicitor to hand over the money, and that the trustee was therefore to be treated as though he “still retained” the money. The English Court of Appeal rejected this argument, holding that the phrase “still retained” covered cases where the trustee had the money or could readily get it, but did not extend to cases where the money had been lost, so that the trustee could no longer get it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 The defendant says that the burden lies on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant is still in possession of trust property.

</div> The defendant is correct. The plaintiff’s submission is based on a misreading of <span class="font-italic">In re Howlett</span>. In that case, the defendant trustee occupied trust property rent-free even though he was liable to pay an occupation rent for it. The beneficiary brought an action seeking an account of the rent. The trustee raised the defence of limitation and argued that he did not in fact receive any rent and therefore had no proceeds of trust property in his possession within the meaning of s 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1939. That section is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of our Limitation Act. Danckwerts J rejected this argument (at 778–779):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is, however, in my view, force in [the beneficiary’s] contention that a trustee who remains in occupation of trust property for his own purposes—and undoubtedly, I think, the husband did so remain—cannot be heard to say that he has not received any rents or profits in respect of the property. Having received, therefore, in theory rents and profits, because he is chargeable with an occupation rent, he cannot discharge himself unless he can show that he has paid moneys away and therefore either discharge himself by proper payments or, indeed, perhaps escape under the Limitation Act having made improper payments. But here the trustee, it seems, did not make any payments out of any kind at all. He merely used the property for his own purposes, and I think the submission of [the beneficiary] is justified, that, having received the occupation rent, for which he is chargeable, he must be considered as still having it in his own pocket at the material date and therefore cannot escape under the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1939.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I take the view that a trustee who has occupied the trust property for himself and is therefore chargeable with an occupation rent and therefore notionally has received the rent of the property on behalf of the beneficiary, and who cannot discharge himself by showing any contra payments, cannot take advantage of s. 19, sub-s. 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), and that therefore the defence of the Statute of Limitations does not succeed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Factually, therefore, the rule in <span class="font-italic">In re Howlett</span> is confined to a case where a trustee has made use of trust property for herself, as a result of which the trust is deprived of the income which that property would otherwise have generated. In such a case, the law treats the trustee as having notionally received and converted the income and treats it as trust property: <span class="font-italic">McGee</span> at para 14.015. The basis for that treatment, it seems to me, is that the trustee has derived a benefit by virtue of his use of the trust property. The value of that benefit may reasonably be equated to the income which the property ought otherwise to have generated (<span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Howlett</span> at 779) and treated as the proceeds of trust property in her possession, since she has enjoyed that benefit. In conceptual terms, the rule in <span class="font-italic">In re Howlett </span>reconceives an issue under the possession limb as an issue under the conversion limb.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision on s 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 I consider first the plaintiff’s case on the possession limb. In my judgment, the plaintiff has adduced no evidence to show that any of the trust money was in the defendant’s possession when he commenced this action. It is not sufficient for the plaintiff to rely simply on the fact that the defendant did receive substantial sums from the plaintiff in the past.

</div>
</div>
</div> The fact that a trustee has received trust money cannot, in itself, justify an inference that the trustee is still in possession of trust money. That is particularly the case when a beneficiary allows so much time to elapse between receipt and the claim for an account. In any event, both parties agree that at least some portion of the trust money was invested and some portion of it was paid back to the plaintiff in New Zealand. It is not entirely clear what the precise figures are on the evidence before me. This is no doubt at least in part because the defendant did not keep and furnish to the plaintiff clear and accurate accounts of that money from 1993 to 2007. But it is also the case that the plaintiff could have obtained accounts if he had sought them promptly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 There is also no merit to the plaintiff’s submission that the rule in <span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Howlett </span>covers the rent from the Shanghai properties.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is not the plaintiff’s case that the defendant derived a benefit by occupying the Shanghai properties herself rent-free. The plaintiff’s case is simply that the defendant has not accounted to him for the rent which she received as his trustee for the Shanghai properties. That is not the concern of the rule in <span class="font-italic">In re Howlett</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Neither can <span class="font-italic">In r</span><span class="font-italic">e Howlett</span> conceivably apply to any of the trust money which the defendant invested on his behalf. That is for the reasons I have set out at [241] above. Accordingly, the burden remains on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant is still in possession of trust property or its proceeds. In my judgment, he has failed to discharge that burden.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 I turn next to the conversion limb. Again, the plaintiff has adduced no evidence to show that the defendant has converted to her use any of the trust money. I have considered and rejected for want of evidence the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant had no means to make the purchases that she did out of her own financial resources and therefore must have misappropriated the plaintiff’s money to do so: see [226] above. I have also rejected as irrelevant the argument, even if correct, that she misappropriated the dividends declared by GK Holding because she never held those shares giving rise to those dividends on trust for the plaintiff: see [228] above. In my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff also fails on the conversion limb. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Limitation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 For the reasons I have given, I hold that the plaintiff’s action for an account against the defendant is barred by s 6(2) of the Limitation Act and that  the plaintiff has proven no breach of an equitable duty on the defendant’s part which brings this case within s 22(1) of the Limitation Act and for which the remedy of an account can be awarded. That suffices to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Discretion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Even if I am wrong in my analysis of the interplay between ss 6(2), 6(7) and 22(1) of the Limitation Act, I retain a discretion not to order an account of the trust money, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> an account of how the defendant dealt with that money which carries back from the present day all the way to the date on which the defendant received each of the plaintiff’s payments between 1993 and 2007. That discretion is to be exercised on the parameters set out in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span> and in consideration of the competing interests I have explained at [187] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 I would have exercised my discretion against the plaintiff and decline to order the defendant to provide an account of the trust money. That account would reach more than 24 years back, to 1993. It would no doubt be a protracted, costly and laborious undertaking. There is no evidence to indicate any possible fraudulent dealing in the trust money which an account might uncover and which would justify the time, expense and labour to which the defendant would be put in order to prepare such an account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 In fact, I am prepared to draw the inference from the evidence that the plaintiff was aware of the key features of what happened to his money from 1993 to 2007. This is one of the reasons for which I believe that ordering the defendant to render an account would serve no useful purpose. Two examples will illustrate this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 First, the evidence shows that the plaintiff took an active role in instructing the defendant on trading foreign currencies with his with money in the Citibank joint account. This is apparent from a chain of email correspondence between the defendant and the plaintiff. In one of these emails, dated 10 June 2009, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant:

The most common one and most people used it as a rule-of-thumb method of quick valuation or guidance to the value of most commercial property is a capitalisation rate of valuation. This method is mainly based on earnings of a particular commercial property concerned. Examples bellowed are the formula of how to calculated it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a) Formula is: Earnings divided by capitalization rate. Earnings is net trading profits, usually before deducting mortgage interest, depreciation and other non-trading expenses. And the capitalization rates are usually determined by the economy condition of the time, the type of industry, location, the age of the building, the construction of the building, etc. Most bankers, land agents, or valuers have these rates on hand.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">e) I think we discussed this before, when our Bank presented us with a valuation of the food court property, remembered.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">f) All the best and good luck.

Although the defendant has not adduced evidence of this type in relation to other investments which she made for the plaintiff, it would have been inconsistent and thus uncharacteristic of the plaintiff to have permitted the defendant full control over those investments with no degree of instruction or supervision. I do not accept that the plaintiff, an experienced businessman, sent the defendant significant sums of money without keeping his own records about how that money was being managed and invested or that he would have remained silent for so long – notwithstanding the family relationship – if he felt that he needed information which he considered to be relevant about how the plaintiff was dealing with his money but was not being supplied it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 In my view, the plaintiff was not a babe in the woods who reposed absolute trust in the defendant to manage and invest the money he paid over to her, as he claims to be. Moreover, his refusal to explain the true purpose for circulating the trust money between New Zealand and Singapore makes me wonder whether he has sought equitable relief with clean hands, although I come to no firm conclusion on this point. In any event, had it been necessary, I would have held that he had not shown any good reason to burden the defendant with the oppressive time, expense and labour of rendering an account of all the money she received from him beginning more than 24 years ago to the present day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 For these reasons, in the exercise of my discretion, I would have declined to order the defendant to produce an account of the US$1,376,000, S$1,584,367.40 and RMB100,000 which I have found her to have received from the plaintiff between 1993 and 2007. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 In conclusion, for all the reasons above, I have dismissed the plaintiff’s action. As a result of the position the defendant has taken on her counterclaim, the counterclaim thereby falls away and must be treated as having been dismissed: see [29] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 I have ordered that the plaintiff to pay the defendant 80% of her costs of and incidental to this action. The plaintiff is obliged in principle to pay the defendant’s costs because there is no reason to depart from the usual principle that costs follow the event. And the event on the claim is decidedly in the defendant’s favour.  However, I have discounted the costs which the plaintiff will have to pay the defendant by 20% in order to reflect the wasted costs which the plaintiff incurred in dealing with the defendant’s counterclaim. That counterclaim was live right up until the trial of this action, when the defendant withdrew it in all but name. It appears to me that that counterclaim was put forward purely tactically and with no serious intent to submit it for adjudication. However, rather than putting the parties to the time and expense of having two bills of costs taxed – for the costs of the claim and of the counterclaim – I have discounted the costs which the defendant is to pay the plaintiff by 20% as a reasonable approximation of the costs of the counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Sia Khoon Kelvin David and Sara Ng Qian Hui (Vicki Heng Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Yeo Choon Hsien Leslie and Shriveena Naidu (Sterling Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
