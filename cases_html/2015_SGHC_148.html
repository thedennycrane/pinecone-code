        George Wei J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In Suit No 238 of 2012, the plaintiffs commenced
                    proceedings and claimed against the defendants on the grounds of passing off,
                    copyright infringement and defamation. The defendants counterclaimed for
                    malicious falsehood and groundless threats of a copyright infringement action.
                    The present trial is bifurcated, and I am only concerned with liability at this
                    stage. In full recognition that this judgment is of substantial length and
                    complexity, I add a glossary of the key acronyms used in the judgment for the
                    reader’s convenience in an appendix at the end of the
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background to the claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       A large number of factual disputes and issues
                    was raised by the parties. Instead of setting out all my factual findings here,
                    I set out only a brief summary of the main events leading up to the dispute. I
                    will discuss my specific factual findings in greater detail where relevant to
                    the legal issues before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The dispute between the parties has a long
                    history, going back well over 15 years. At trial, the parties’
                    recollections of the dates and details of many material events were often
                    inconsistent or hazy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">S H Econ Electrical Trading</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       See Lam Huat (“the 2nd Plaintiff”)
                    and See Lam Seng (“the 2nd Defendant”) are brothers. Sometime in
                    1998, the 2nd Defendant started a sole proprietorship under the name of S H Econ
                    Electrical Trading (“S H Econ”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In 2001, S H Econ was converted into
                    a partnership in the names of the 2nd Defendant and his other brother, See Lam
                    Quee (“SLQ”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In reality, S H Econ was a
                    partnership between the 2nd Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant. Although the 2nd
                    Plaintiff was not formally named as a partner, SLQ’s shares and interest
                    in the partnership were held on trust for the 2nd Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    The brothers entered into this complicated arrangement because the 2nd Plaintiff
                    was being sued by a creditor, and he did not want the legal dispute to
                    jeopardise the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It appears that S H Econ was (at least
                    initially) in the business of acquiring outdated and/or second-hand electrical
                    and household products in Singapore and Malaysia for resale to customers
                        overseas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> It is unclear how the partnership was
                    run. The role played by each partner in the partnership was never clearly
                    explained to the court. No written partnership agreement of any sort has been
                    adduced in evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The start of the new millennium witnessed a
                    number of significant events. Apart from the conversion of S H Econ into a
                    partnership, the 2nd Defendant and SLQ purchased three shop houses in Singapore
                    (“the Shop Houses”). Legally, the 2nd Defendant and SLQ each held
                    a 50% share in the Shop Houses as tenants-in-common.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    However, beneficially, SLQ held his share of the Shop Houses on trust for the
                    2nd Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The brothers entered into this
                    arrangement also because the 2nd Plaintiff was worried that any property in his
                    name might be subject to seizure by the same creditor mentioned
                        above.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Disputes eventually arose between the brothers
                    over the invoices and accounts of S H Econ. Whilst the evidence as to when the
                    said disputes started is hotly contested and confused, it is clear that by 2005,
                    the relationship between the 2nd Plaintiff and 2nd Defendant had
                        deteriorated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> On 9
                    November 2007, the 2nd Defendant commenced Originating Summons No 1652 of 2007
                    (“OS 1652/2007”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> against the 2nd Plaintiff and SLQ to
                    liquidate the Shop Houses, and for an account of monies due to the partners from
                    the S H Econ business. OS 1652/2007 was settled before the actual hearing, set
                    for June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The S H Econ partnership was subsequently
                    dissolved. The date of S H Econ’s dissolution is unclear. The 2nd
                    Plaintiff claims that the dissolution happened in 2007. The 2nd Defendant
                    however asserts that S H Econ was only dissolved in 2009. I note in passing,
                    that in all probability, the 2nd Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant effectively
                    ceased working together sometime around 2007, but the S H Econ partnership was
                    only legally dissolved in January 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Singsung Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Either way it is clear that in April 2006,
                    before the dissolution of the S H Econ partnership, the 2nd Plaintiff
                    incorporated Singsung Pte Ltd (“the 1st Plaintiff”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    The name “Singsung” was chosen by the 2nd Plaintiff. The 1st
                    Plaintiff was in the business of selling new electrical and household equipment.
                    Whilst the plaintiffs assert that some of these new products were sold in
                    Singapore to Singapore-based customers for use in Singapore, it is apparent that
                    the vast majority of the sales were to trade buyers who exported the products
                        overseas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Further, whilst the
                    plaintiffs assert that their trade buyer customers come from a variety of
                    African and Asian countries, it appears that most of the new products were
                    acquired by foreign trade buyers for sale to end users (or consumers) in Africa.
                    In particular, the evidence adduced by the parties related <em>only</em> to end users from the Republic of Cameroon
                    (“Cameroon”). As such, where the foreign markets in which the
                    plaintiffs’ and defendants’ products are sold become relevant, my
                    discussion will mainly centre on the market in Cameroon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The 2nd Plaintiff’s position is that the
                    business of the 1st Plaintiff belongs solely to him. In particular, the said
                    business was never a part of S H Econ’s business. This is so even though
                    there are invoices which suggest that at least some of the 1st Plaintiff’s
                    business operations in 2007 were being conducted through S H Econ. The
                    plaintiffs claim that the 1st Plaintiff’s business was conducted in that
                    way purely as a matter of convenience. The question as to whether S H Econ had
                    any interest in the 1st Plaintiff will be discussed later in connection with the
                    plaintiffs’ claim for passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In October 2007, the 2nd Defendant registered
                    L S Electrical Trading (“the 1st Defendant”) as a sole
                        proprietorship.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Initially, the 1st Defendant dealt
                    only in the purchase and re-sale of <em>second-hand</em>
                    electrical goods. However, the 1st Defendant soon expanded into the business of
                    purchasing and selling <em>new</em> electrical and
                    household products to foreign trade buyers for export to consumers in Africa and
                    elsewhere. In January 2009, the 1st Defendant, LG26 Electronics Pte Ltd (trading
                    as L S Electrical Trading), was legally incorporated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    The brand name adopted by the 2nd Defendant was “LS”. The long and
                    short of the evidence is that the brothers had gone their separate ways and were
                    now effectively competitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ products</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The 1st Plaintiff’s first line of new
                    products appears to have been DVD players. Subsequently, it expanded its range
                    of products to include television sets, rice cookers, electric kettles,
                    blenders, floor fans and gas stoves.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 1st Plaintiff’s business model
                    involves sourcing its products from manufacturers in China. Typically, the 2nd
                    Plaintiff would visit the Chinese factories and examine the range of products
                    the factories had. The products were often displayed in the premises of the
                    factories, or were set out in the factories’ catalogues.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    I pause here to note that it is helpful to determine whether these Chinese
                    factories are original <em>equipment</em> manufacturers
                    (“OEMs”), or original <em>design</em>
                    manufacturers (“ODMs”). Whilst these are not legal terms but trade
                    terms, and whilst the legal principles of intellectual property law do not
                    depend on these categories, an appreciation of the factual differences between
                    these two types of manufacturers is helpful. To be clear, I use the terms OEM
                    and ODM in this judgment purely for convenience and expediency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     An OEM generally refers to a manufacturer who
                    produces component parts for another manufacturer, who then incorporates the
                    component parts into its products. The final products are sold under the second
                    manufacturer’s brand name. For example, where a United States computer
                    manufacturer orders the hard disk drives installed inside its computers from a
                    Chinese disk manufacturer, the latter is an OEM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, consider the following example:
                    Company A designs and manufactures a product, which is sold to Company B.
                    Company B then releases and sells the product into the market under its own
                    brand. In this example, Company A is not an OEM, but an ODM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There can be many variants of the factual
                    pattern described above, and the exact relationship between Company A and
                    Company B will depend on the particular facts. In some cases, Company B may be
                    permitted to request certain design alterations or modifications. In other
                    cases, Company A may design and produce the product under its own brand.
                    Subsequently, it may enter into an arrangement with Company B whereby Company B
                    can apply its own brand to the product under some form of reseller
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present case, it appears that the
                    Chinese factories were in the position of being ODMs because they designed and
                    manufactured the 1st Plaintiff’s products. In many cases, the Chinese
                    factories offered numerous different models of a particular product line. The
                    models were of different sizes, surface designs and decoration, or technical
                    features. Customers such as the 1st Plaintiff ordered the model(s) of their
                    choosing, and in some cases, asked for changes to particular aspects of the
                    product. This included requests relating to the packaging.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The question as to who owns the intellectual
                    property rights in the design and technology of the products (if any) depends on
                    the facts of each case. <em>Prima facie</em>, any
                    industrial design right will likely belong to the ODM. Any technology invented
                    or developed by the ODM will also likely belong to him. In other words, going
                    back to the example I gave above, <em>prima facie</em>,
                    Company A owns the intellectual property rights in the design and technology of
                    the products that it designs and manufacturers and then sells to Company
                    B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     However, the question whether Company B
                    acquires rights over the design and technology will depend on whether these have
                    been assigned or licensed (any type of licence) by Company A to Company B. It
                    also depends on whether Company B brought in any intellectual property of its
                    own to the products. The question as to whether the ODM (<em>ie</em>, Company A) has lost the right to sell the chosen models to
                    other customers, including competitors of Company B, also must depend primarily
                    on the <em>agreement reached between the parties</em>. In
                    some cases, Company A may agree to sell the selected range of products
                    exclusively to Company B. In other cases, there may be no express restriction or
                    other limitation placed on Company A’s right to sell the same range of
                    products to other customers. Further, questions may arise over the legal rights
                    in respect of changes or alterations made at the request and/or instruction of
                    Company B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It should also be kept in mind that the
                    position is rendered even more complex by the range of different intellectual
                    property rights that may exist in relation to the products. Even if Company A
                    owns the industrial design rights in a product, this does not mean that Company
                    B cannot acquire goodwill over aspects of the product’s get-up in a
                    particular market. Such goodwill would enable Company B to claim protection over
                    those aspects of get-up under the tort of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the present case, it is clear that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff would visit the Chinese ODMs and place a bulk order for the products
                    of his choosing. Depending on the factory and the type of product, some degree
                    of customisation of the product and the packaging was possible. I give some
                    examples of the customisation requested by the 2nd Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the case of the DVD players, the
                        plaintiffs were able to secure some changes to the number of ports provided
                        at the back of the player. Additionally, the plaintiffs were allowed to make
                        suggestions in respect of the design of packaging.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the case of television sets, the
                        plaintiffs requested that a sticker be placed on the screen, setting out key
                        features or functions of the product.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     The 1st Plaintiff’s brand
                        “SINGSUNG”, the statement “Made in Singapore”,
                        and the Plaintiff’s warranty card was also affixed to some of the 1st
                        Plaintiff’s products and packaging. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     To sum up the above discussion, whilst the
                    plaintiffs could and did request for some changes to the products they ordered
                    from the Chinese manufacturers, it is clear that the plaintiffs were <em>not</em> the manufacturers of the products. Neither can they
                    be properly regarded as the designers of the products, save in the manner that I
                    have briefly alluded to (<em>ie</em>, by making small
                    alterations and additions to the products). They were in a loose sense resellers
                    who have applied their own brand to the acquired products. The brand names were
                    affixed or applied in China by the ODMs. The evidence that some of the Chinese
                    manufacturers may have assigned the intellectual property rights over the design
                    and technology embodied in the products to the plaintiffs is unclear, and will
                    be referred to later. Indeed, as will be seen and discussed in more detail
                    below, the Chinese manufacturers were, in general, prepared to sell their
                    product range to any trade buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Aside from requesting changes to the
                    appearance of the packaging, and on some occasions, requesting minor changes to
                    the product, the main effort expended by the 2nd Plaintiff was to be found in
                    his selection of particular models from a product line which he thought would be
                    attractive to the overseas trade buyers, and in particular the African trade
                    buyers. On all accounts, it appears that the 1st Plaintiff’s business was
                    rather successful, chalking up substantial sales to trade buyers from
                        Africa.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ grievances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Essentially, the core of the plaintiffs’
                    complaint against the defendants is that they chose to shadow the business of
                    the 1st Plaintiff. The 2nd Plaintiff (through the 1st Plaintiff) moved into the
                    business of acquiring <em>new</em> electrical and household
                    products for sale to overseas trade buyers first. The defendants decided to
                    follow suit even though they started their business with the sale of second-hand
                    equipment. They also moved into new products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     One of the plaintiffs’ biggest
                    grievances is clearly that the products chosen by the defendants were
                    essentially identical to those chosen by the 2nd Plaintiff and sold by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff. For example, if the plaintiffs
                    purchased and started selling electric kettles with a particular pattern and
                    shape, the defendants would follow suit and place orders for the same or similar
                    kettles. Sometimes, the Chinese manufacturer selected by the defendants turned
                    out to be the same as the one who supplied the goods to the 1st
                        Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The export market targeted was also the same,
                    namely, overseas trade buyers from, in particular, Cameroon.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At this point, I note again that the evidence
                    does not establish that the plaintiffs are the designers of the products they
                    chose. As will be seen, a huge range of kettles were designed by the Chinese
                    manufacturers and displayed or set out in catalogues for wholesale buyers to
                    choose from. On the whole, the evidence is that these Chinese design
                    manufacturers would sell their products to any wholesale merchant. If
                    exclusivity was required, this would have to be contractually provided
                    for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Complaint was also made that in some cases,
                    the defendants did not just choose the same or a similar <em>product</em>, but they also used similar <em>packaging</em> (<em>eg</em>, the cartons in
                    which the products were presented for sale to retail customers). This was so in
                    the case of the DVD players and televisions. In the case of the televisions, the
                    defendants did not merely choose similar television models; they also requested
                    similar stickers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Whilst it is clear that the defendants decided
                    to “shadow” the 1st Plaintiff’s business, I should stress
                    that the <em>brand name</em> affixed to the 1st
                    Defendant’s new products is completely different from the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s. The 1st Plaintiff’s brand is “SINGSUNG”.
                    The 1st Defendant’s brand is “LS”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     After placing the bulk orders, the shipments
                    would arrive in Singapore, where they were stored in warehouses. The 1st
                    Plaintiff had a shop at 38/39 Upper Weld Road Singapore. The defendants’
                    shop was next door, at 36/37 Upper Weld Road.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The evidence was that trade buyers
                    would visit Singapore and attend at the shop premises (and elsewhere) for
                    discussion and selection of products. After orders were placed, the consignment
                    would be loaded into containers and shipped to the trade buyers’ home
                    country, where they would eventually be on-sold by the trade buyers to retail
                    shops and end users.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     That said, the evidence as to how <em>exactly</em> the placement of orders with the Chinese
                    manufacturers, the shipment to Singapore, and sale to trade buyers from Africa
                    were carried out, was in dispute. In particular, the defendants’ general
                    position is that the goods merely transited through Singapore, and then went
                    straight on to Africa.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> This formed the basis of their
                    submission that any goodwill enjoyed by the 1st Plaintiff (if at all) is only so
                    enjoyed in Africa.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiffs complain that even if the trade
                    buyers were not confused over the origin of the LS products that they selected
                    in Singapore, the end-buyers (consumers) in Cameroon would be confused. Given
                    the products had the same or similar design, members of the public in Cameroon
                    would purchase “LS” products under the impression that they were
                    connected in some way with the 1st Plaintiff and the SINGSUNG brand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The complaint is that
                    the defendants were effectively copying the business of the 1st
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claims and issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiffs’ main cause of action is
                    founded on passing off. Without going into the details, the claim is in respect
                    of goodwill asserted in the “get-up” and certain design aspects of
                    the following products belonging to the 1st Plaintiff: DVD players, television
                    sets, rice cookers, electric kettles, electric blenders, electric floor fans and
                    gas stoves. The following issues arise in respect of this claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     Is there goodwill in the claimed
                        badges or indicators of origin?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was there a misrepresentation by the defendants likely to
                        cause confusion? Specifically, can there be liability for passing off in
                        Singapore where the confusion (assuming this is proved) in respect of the
                        goods supplied from Singapore arises solely or mainly in an <em>overseas market</em>, and not in Singapore? I note here
                        that there is no claim before me that while the tort of passing off was
                        committed in another country, the foreign tort is actionable in Singapore
                        under applicable principles of private international law: on this point, see
                        Tan Tee Jim, <em>Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off in
                            Singapore</em> vol 2 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2014)
                            (“<em>Tan Tee Jim</em>”) at
                        paras 19.314–19.322.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     Has there been damage, or is there likely to be damage,
                        to the 1st Plaintiff’s goodwill?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In addition, the plaintiffs claim copyright
                    over some pictures on the packaging of the DVD players, the start-up screen
                    built into the DVD players, the design of a sticker, a logo and a floral
                    pattern. By logo, what is referred to is the phrase “Rotary
                    Rotatory” set out in a cursive font. The following issues arise in
                    relation to the copyright infringement claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     Is there any copyright subject
                        matter over which the plaintiffs can claim ownership?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     If there is, are the defendants liable
                        for copyright infringement in Singapore?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I note that the defendants deny copyright
                    infringement, and counterclaim for losses arising from the plaintiffs making
                    groundless threats of a copyright infringement action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The 2nd Plaintiff also proceeds against the
                    2nd Defendant in the tort of defamation. The 2nd Plaintiff claims that the 2nd
                    Defendant defamed him when the latter made remarks to a visiting trade buyer
                    describing the 2nd Plaintiff as, <em>inter alia</em>, a
                    cheat. These are the issues which I have to decide in relation to
                    defamation:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the 2nd Defendant utter the
                        words alleged?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     If he did, do the words spoken by the 2nd Defendant bear a defamatory
                        meaning?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the
                        words do bear a defamatory meaning, do the defences of justification or
                        qualified privilege apply?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The defendants, on the other hand,
                    counterclaim for malicious falsehood. They allege that the 2nd Plaintiff made
                    disparaging remarks about the quality of the 1st Defendant’s products to a
                    trade buyer. The principal issues here are whether the disparaging statement was
                    true, whether it was made maliciously, and whether it has resulted in special
                    damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I note that no claim has been brought for
                    registered trade mark infringement. There is also no claim in respect of
                    registered design rights or patent rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At trial, 11 witnesses gave evidence. Given
                    the large number of factual and legal disputes, as well as the length of the
                    cross-examination, I propose to set out a brief summary of the main areas of
                    evidence covered by each witness. Where relevant, portions of the evidence will
                    be discussed in more detail later in the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiffs’ witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     See Lam Huat: the 2nd Plaintiff was the
                    principal witness for the plaintiffs. His evidence traversed the background to
                    the dispute, as briefly set out above. In particular, he gave evidence
                    on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     how he came to select the products
                        that are the subject matter of the dispute;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     his visits to the factories and manufacturers in
                        China; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        inputs he claimed to have made in respect of the packaging and get-up of the
                        products in dispute, including design changes to the number of ports on the
                        DVD players, his requests for warranty cards, stickers, and so
                    forth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The thrust of his evidence was that he spent
                    considerable time and effort selecting products he thought would appeal to end
                        users.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The models or products that he
                    selected were of high quality. The end users (in Cameroon) were familiar with
                    the “SINGSUNG” brand and associated it with high quality products
                    from Singapore. The products generally bore the statement “Made in
                    Singapore”, even though the products were essentially designed and made
                    in China. In some cases, Singapore warranty cards in SINGSUNG’s name were
                    provided even though the end user in Cameroon had no effective recourse against
                    the plaintiffs should the 1st Plaintiff’s products turn out to be
                    defective. The end user’s only recourse was to bring the defective product
                    back to the retail shop in Cameroon. His evidence was that customers in Cameroon
                    associated Singapore with high quality products, and that
                    “SINGSUNG” had acquired a good reputation in that
                        market.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Huang Bao Yu (“HBY”): HBY was a
                    marketing representative from the Chinese manufacturer that supplied blenders to
                    the plaintiffs. Her evidence primarily concerned a catalogue of products that
                    the Chinese manufacturer made available to its customers. The catalogue sets out
                    a broad range of blenders from which the customer could make a selection. The
                    1st Plaintiff was one such customer. The witness testified that the catalogue
                    sets out the whole range of blenders offered, and that the Chinese manufacturer
                    designed all the products.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The witness also
                    gave evidence on her company’s business dealings and relationship with the
                    defendants, as well as the defendants’ requests for blenders of a
                    particular design and warranty cards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Serene Chew Wanlin (“SEC”): SEC
                    is an arts management student. The 1st Plaintiff briefly employed her as an
                    administrative assistant from January to July 2010. Her evidence mainly
                    concerned her role in assisting the 2nd Plaintiff develop designs for the
                    packaging of the DVD players and the sticker for a range of television sets that
                    the plaintiffs had sourced from Chinese manufacturers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Guy Emmanuel Ntoudam (“GEN”):
                    GEN is a businessman from Douala, Cameroon. He is in the import and retail-goods
                    business. Products that he sources from overseas include DVD players, television
                    sets, electric blenders, floor fans and gas stoves of the SINGSUNG brand. These
                    are obtained from the plaintiffs in Singapore. This witness gave evidence of the
                    market in Cameroon, the competition in Douala between SINGSUNG branded products
                    and LS appliances, as well as the alleged confusion that had arisen amongst the
                    end consumers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> The
                    witness also testified that he made several visits to the defendants’ shop
                    in Singapore in September 2011, during which the 2nd Defendant made derogatory
                    remarks about the 2nd Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Chen Yongxiu (“CYX”): CYX was
                    employed by the 1st Plaintiff as a quality control manager. She was based at the
                    1st Plaintiff’s office in Shenzhen, China. Her evidence traversed the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s working visits to factories in China and the inputs made by
                    the 2nd Plaintiff on design tweaks to various products purchased from those
                    factories. Her evidence touched on nearly all the disputed products: the DVD
                    players, television sets, electric kettles, blenders and rice cookers. She also
                    gave evidence on the competition from and alleged copying by the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendants’ witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     See Lam Seng: the 2nd Defendant was the main
                    witness for the defence. His evidence traversed the same ground as the 2nd
                    Plaintiff, and included testimony on the business of S H Econ, the split between
                    the brothers, and the development of the 1st Defendant’s business
                    (including his role in selecting products from the Chinese manufacturers). The
                    general tenor of his evidence was that he would look for particular models or
                    designs from the Chinese manufacturers based on requests from
                customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Dong Li (“DL”): DL was an
                    employee of the 1st Defendant and was based in Hong Kong. Her job was to place
                    and process orders for products (in particular the television sets, rice
                    cookers, and blenders) selected by the defendants with the Chinese ODMs. This
                    included making requests for certain design changes as well as warranty
                    cards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     See Nam Hai (“SNH”): SNH was a
                    brother of the 2nd Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant. His evidence concerned his
                    own business dealing with second-hand electrical goods and his relationship with
                    the defendants. He also gave evidence on the breakup of the partnership at S H
                    Econ, and testified that he helps out at the 1st Defendant’s
                shop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Talla Simplice Adolphe (“TSA”):
                    TSA was a trader from Cameroon. His evidence touched on the nature of the market
                    in Cameroon for electrical household products and “famous” brands
                    such as “SONY”, “SAMSUNG” and
                        “LG”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> This witness also gave
                    evidence on the presence of Singapore brands such as “SINGSUNG”,
                    “LS” and “Sole Star” in the African market. The
                    witness explained his business dealings with the plaintiffs and the defendants,
                    and testified as to why he eventually decided to place orders with the
                    defendants. This witness also gave evidence of disparaging remarks allegedly
                    made by the 2nd Plaintiff about the quality of the 1st Defendant’s
                        goods.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Phang Ti Hui (“PTH”): PTH is a
                    Singapore businessman who accompanied the 2nd Defendant on some of his trips to
                    China. The purpose of those trips was to purchase DVD players and television
                    sets for the 1st Defendant’s business. His evidence touched on the extent
                    to which the Chinese manufacturers offered customization of the products and
                    packaging.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">An overview of the plaintiffs’ claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Before I turn to consider each issue in
                    detail, an overview of the plaintiffs’ claims may be helpful given the
                    large number of issues before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Passing off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiffs’ claim in passing off is
                    primarily based on the allegation that the defendants copied the design, get-up
                    and packaging of the 1st Plaintiff’s products in manufacturing their own
                    products. There is no allegation that the defendants used the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff’s brand
                    (“SINGSUNG”) as such (save possibly in some warranty cards).
                    Indeed, it is not disputed that the brand chosen and used by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on its products (<em>ie</em>, “LS”) is completely different from the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff’s brand. To be absolutely
                    clear, the plaintiffs’ passing off claim is not based on goodwill in its
                    brand name “SINGSUNG”, but in the get-up described
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I now identify and describe (where possible)
                    the specific get-up and packaging of each of the 1st Plaintiff’s products
                    that are the subject matter of the present dispute, and which the plaintiffs
                    claim are the generators of goodwill:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     Packaging of DVD Player Model A
                        (“DVD A”). I shall call this the “White Get-Up”.
                        This refers to the use of a white carton box depicting, amongst other
                        things, a photographic image of a modern living room and
                    guitars.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     Packaging
                        of DVD Player Model B (“DVD B”). I shall call this the
                        “Blue Get-Up”. This refers to the use of a blue carton box
                        depicting, amongst other things, an image of the actual DVD player. The
                        evidence suggests that there were in fact a number of versions of DVD B
                        sourced by the plaintiffs and on-sold to African
                    importers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     Start-up
                        screen of DVD A and DVD B. This refers to an image that appears on the
                        television when the DVD player is turned on. The image comprises snow-capped
                        mountains set against a blue sky with white clouds.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_d"></a>(d)     Warranty card on DVD A and DVD B. This
                        refers to the warranty card provided with the SINGSUNG DVD
                    players.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_e"></a>(e)     Design of
                        the back panel of DVD A and DVD B.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_f"></a>(f)     Stickers on DVD A and DVD B. The sticker is placed on the
                        front panel of DVD A and DVD B, setting out key functions and attributes of
                        DVD A and DVD B, such as “USB Download Function” and
                        “32 Digital Game”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_g"></a>(g)     Sticker on television sets. The design and placement of a
                        sticker on the television screen, setting out key features and attributes of
                        the television, such as “Rotary Rotatory”, and a symbol
                        indicating that the TV can swivel 90 degrees. The phrase “Rotary
                        Rotatory” also appears on the packaging of the television
                    set.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_h"></a>(h)     Floral pattern
                        on the rice cooker. There is a floral pattern design on the side of the rice
                        cooker. It is noted that whilst the 1st Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant
                        dealt with a range of rice cookers, the plaintiffs’ claim was in
                        respect of “model no RC-18L”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_i"></a>(i)     In relation to the electric kettles, the
                        plaintiffs referred to the shape and design of five different electric
                        kettles, each with its own get-up. The plaintiffs described these five
                        kettles as possessing the “Domed-Get-up”, the “Pitcher
                        Plant Get-Up”, the “White Curved Kettle Get-Up”, the
                        “Penguin Kettle Get-Up”, and the “Metallic
                        Get-Up”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_j"></a>(j)     In relation to the electric blenders, the plaintiffs referred to the shape
                        and design of three different electric blenders. Each of these blenders
                        possesses its own get-up, and has been described by the plaintiffs as the
                        “White and Grey Get-Up”, the “Black and White
                        Get-Up” and the “Black Stainless Steel
                    Get-Up”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_k"></a>(k)     Get-up of the electric floor fans. This refers to a particular model of
                        fans, CRSF-18A, which contain a round plastic base made in the shape of a
                        car steering wheel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_l"></a>(l)     Get-up of the gas stoves. This refers to the design of gas stove
                        GS-88, comprising features like an embossed horse-shoe shape bearing the
                        SINGSUNG brand, as well as a gold coloured burner rimmed by a circular
                        chrome support pot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I refer to this collectively as “the SINGSUNG
                    Get-Up”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I repeat the observation I made above, that
                    all of the above products were designed and made in China by ODMs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiffs adduced evidence of its
                    substantial sales in Singapore to overseas trade buyers, as well as some sales
                    to Singapore-based customers. The defendants deny that any sales to
                    Singapore-based customers exist. However, even taking the plaintiffs’
                    evidence at face value and at its highest, it is clear that the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s sales to Singapore-based customers is very significantly less
                    than its sales to wholesale buyers from Africa. These wholesale buyers ordered
                    products from the 1st Plaintiff in Singapore for export and sale to consumers
                    overseas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The plaintiffs also assert that the defendants
                    had used similar expressions in marketing or advertising their rival products.
                    In particular, the plaintiffs point out that the phrase “<em>Rely on us, as amongst the FINEST, we offer the MOST affordable
                        prices</em>” can be found in both English and Swahili in the
                    1st Plaintiff’s catalogue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>
                    This phrase is also found in the LS catalogue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In
                    response, the 2nd Defendant asserts that he did not intend to copy the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s catalogue, and that he used it for reference only.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                    I should point out that the plaintiffs have not asserted any rights in the
                    phrases as such. Instead, they merely rely on the alleged use of the phrases as
                        <em>evidence</em> of the defendants’ intention to
                    copy the 1st Plaintiff’s business and to cause confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The passing off claim, as it developed during
                    the course of the hearing, appears to be founded on two different submissions.
                    First, the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendants have passed off their
                    products as being those of the 1st Plaintiff. Second, the plaintiffs’
                    claim that defendants have passed off their business as being associated with or
                    connected with the 1st Plaintiff. What has not been clearly pleaded in my view,
                    however, is the <em>exact form</em> of the passing off.
                    Given the 1st Plaintiff is not a direct retailer, but is more a wholesale trade
                    buyer in Singapore which sells its products to middlemen who export the products
                    to other countries, precisely identifying the relevant market in which passing
                    off is claimed to have taken place is crucial. I elaborate on this
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Copyright</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The plaintiffs’ copyright claim is
                    advanced on the basis of the following works:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     The “White Get-Up”

                        previously, this is found on the packaging of DVD A.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     The “Blue Get-Up”
                        picture comprising the picture of a DVD player. As mentioned previously,

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     The sticker pasted on the television

                        start-up screen linked to the DVD players.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiffs assert that the above works
                    attract copyright protection as <em>original artistic
                        works</em> in Singapore. There is no claim to literary copyright or

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The claim of defamation is a claim by the 2nd
                    Plaintiff against the 2nd Defendant, based on certain words spoken by the 2nd
                    Defendant to GEN. According to the 2nd Plaintiff, the 2nd Defendant had said
                    that:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     the 2nd Plaintiff was “very
                        dangerous.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In addition, there is an allegation that the
                    2nd Defendant uttered words to the effect that the 1st Plaintiff had sold some
                    defective DVD players and TV sets. Apart from having to resolve the factual
                    dispute as to whether the 2nd Defendant did indeed speak the words described
                    above, the question arises as to whether those words are defamatory, and if so,
                    whether the defence of justification and/or qualified privilege applies. Now
                    that I have set out broadly the claims made by the parties, I turn to analyse
                    the plaintiffs’ first claim: passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Passing off</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ pleaded case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As alluded to above, the plaintiffs’
                    pleaded case for passing off is somewhat unclear. The lack of clarity, in my
                    view, mainly stemmed from insufficient attention to the territorially-specific
                    nature of any passing off claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It is well established that for a passing off
                    claim to succeed, a plaintiff needs to prove goodwill, misrepresentation, and
                    damage: <em>Novelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and
                        another</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 216 at [36] (“<em>Novelty v Amanresorts</em>”). It is also well established that
                    the goodwill must exist, and the misrepresentation must take place, in the
                    relevant jurisdiction or market with which the particular court is concerned.
                    So, before a Singapore court, it must ordinarily be established that goodwill
                    exists in Singapore for a passing off claim in Singapore to succeed: <em>Staywell Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts
                        Worldwide, Inc and another and another appeal</em> [2014] 1 SLR 911 at
                    [130]. Likewise, goodwill must exist in the United Kingdom (“the
                    UK”) for a passing off action in the UK to succeed: <em>Tan Tee Jim</em> at para 19.144 and <em>Starbucks
                        (HK) Limited and anor v British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC and
                        others</em> [2015] UKSC 31 (“<em>Starbucks
                        (HK)</em>”). I state at the outset that there are
                    qualifications to this principle, one of which is crucial to this case, and
                    which I will discuss in greater detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It follows that a plaintiff pursuing a passing
                    off claim involving foreign elements needs to plead his case very precisely. It
                    is insufficient for a plaintiff to state that his brand name or get-up (or
                    whatever he claims to be a generator of goodwill) has generated goodwill. It is
                    essential that he pleads and proves that the goodwill he owns exists in the
                    relevant jurisdiction. It is also essential that he pleads and proves that a
                    misrepresentation has taken place in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the present case, the plaintiffs have
                    failed to plead essential details about their passing off claim in the statement
                    of claim. While the plaintiffs assert in their statement of claim that the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up has “gained goodwill”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> and that it “denotes to the trade
                    and public that the Singsung Products are of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Plaintiff”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> they never once specify
                    which “trade and public” they refer to, or <em>where</em> the SINGSUNG Get-Up has “gained goodwill”.
                    Much is left for the court to infer based on the evidence the plaintiffs present
                    and the arguments they employ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Indeed, the language used in the pleadings on
                    misrepresentation was also vague on this issue. I quote portions of the
                    plaintiffs’ statement of claim to illustrate my point:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s distribution,
                        sale, offering for sale and/or dealing in the Offending Products bearing
                        get-up and stickers identical or confusingly similar to the Singsung
                        Products in meaning and commercial impression is calculated to deceive
                        and/or mislead the <em>trade and public</em> and has in
                        fact deceived and/or misled the <em>trade and
                            public</em> into believing that the Offending Products originate
                        from and are somehow associated with those of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27A. Further and in the alternative, by reason of the foregoing, the

                            1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, or has confused the <em>trade and public</em> into thinking that the business of
                        the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is associated with that of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, when that is not the
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It can be seen that the reader is left
                    uncertain as to <em>where</em> the misrepresentation has
                    taken place. In particular, it is wholly unclear which “trade and
                    public” is deceived, misled or confused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I bring up this point about pleadings because
                    it is particularly pertinent for a plaintiff in a case with facts which involve
                    domestic and foreign markets to be sensitive to the territorial nature of a
                    passing off claim, and plead its claim(s) precisely. Here, there are several
                    markets and jurisdictions potentially involved—Singapore, Cameroon, and
                    all other markets to which the 1st Plaintiff’s products are exported. As
                    such, without clear pleadings, the court will have real difficulty evaluating
                    the plaintiffs’ passing off claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Nevertheless, notwithstanding the lack of
                    clarity in the pleadings, the plaintiffs eventually developed their case as we
                    drew to the end of trial. In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs remained
                    somewhat unclear about the jurisdiction in which they claim goodwill exists.
                    They state that “Singsung has the requisite goodwill” in their
                    closing submissions,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> but clearly, that is not
                    sufficiently particularised. Some clarity may however be sought from the way the
                    plaintiffs describe the misrepresentations they claim have taken place. They
                    claim firstly, that the defendants confused the traders that visited the 1st
                    Defendant’s shop in Singapore;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> and secondly, they claim that the ultimate
                    consumer in Africa is also confused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Using the plaintiffs’ own words,
                    “passing-off is likely to occur at the point of sale, and even post-sale,
                    to the ultimate consumer”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     From the above, I believe it may be reasonably
                    deduced that the plaintiffs’ passing off claim (in brief) is
                    two-fold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, passing off takes place
                        straightforwardly in Singapore because goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up
                        exists in Singapore, and trade consumers/customers who buy directly from the
                        plaintiffs and defendants are deceived or confused by the similar get-up on
                        the defendants’ products. I call this the straightforward passing off
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        passing off takes place in Singapore because by selling their infringing
                        products to overseas trade buyers in Singapore, the defendants put into
                        circulation “instruments of deception”. This second claim is
                        supported by proof that goodwill exists in Cameroon (rather than Singapore),
                        and that there is confusion there between the plaintiffs’ and
                        defendants’ products because of the similar
                get-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It is on the basis of the above two claims (so
                    characterised) that I shall proceed. I note that while the language of
                    “instruments of deceptions” cannot be found in the pleadings, in
                    fairness to the plaintiffs, such an argument is made in their closing
                    submissions at paras 89–93. I shall discuss the law and the evidence
                    in relation to each of the above two claims separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interaction between the tort of passing off and other intellectual
                property protection </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Before discussing the passing off claim any
                    further, it may be helpful to briefly explore the interaction between the tort
                    of passing off and other intellectual property protection (such as copyright and
                    industrial design protection). In particular, given that several different
                    intellectual and industrial property rights can be claimed in respect of a
                    single product, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the distinctions
                    between the various available rights. This would help to bring into sharper
                    focus the aim of the law of passing off, as well as provide a helpful context
                    for the subsequent discussion on passing off and the dispute that has arisen
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Passing off is not concerned with product
                    design as such. Depending on the design in question and the surrounding
                    circumstances, a design might be protected by registration under the Registered
                    Designs Act (Cap 266, 2005 Rev Ed). Registered design law is concerned with the
                    protection of industrial designs. This includes protecting the appearance of
                    articles of manufacture where the said appearance, in whole or in part, is
                    chosen because of the visual statement that is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In some cases, it may also be possible to
                    assert copyright in industrial design drawings, sketches, sculptures, models,
                    works of artistic craftsmanship or engravings. These works can constitute
                    original artistic works protected under copyright law. I note that while in the
                    early days, copyright in an artistic work was thought to be concerned <em>only</em> with works of art, it has long since been
                    established that “artistic works” can include works like
                    engineering drawings which serve a purely functional purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The law has long been concerned to maintain
                    the line between registered design and copyright laws. Extensive and complicated
                    provisions now exist to limit the copyright protection given to designs that are
                    capable of protection under the registered design system. If the law was
                    otherwise, the carefully crafted checks and balances woven into registered
                    design law could be circumvented by a proprietor’s decision not to
                    register the industrial design, and to rely on copyright instead. Indeed, these
                    issues have provoked considerable academic discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Different rights under the tort of passing off
                    and trade mark law may also come into play where product get-up and shape are
                    concerned. Both the get-up and shape of a product (which may be the subject
                    matter of the tort of passing off and registered trade mark law), as well as the
                    industrial (or registered) design of a product, are primarily concerned with
                        <em>visual appearance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, and crucially, the difference between
                    passing off and registered design rights lies in the function that the
                    appearance of the product performs: is the get-up or shape serving the role of
                    an <em>indicator of trade origin</em> (to distinguish the
                    goods from one trade source from those from another trade source), or is it
                    simply there to make an <em>“aesthetic”
                        contribution</em> via the visual statement it makes?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     A designer may select a particular design
                    feature (such as a specific pattern, ornamentation, colour combination, or
                    shape) because the said feature would be, in the designer’s judgment,
                    attractive to his customers. A customer who selects a product for its design may
                    do so because the design is pleasing to the eye, or because the design is
                    “functional” and makes the article easy to use. Indeed, I have no
                    doubt that considerable thought is often expended to make the design of an
                    article aesthetically pleasing, yet simple and functional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     However, the aesthetic or functional value of
                    a product design is not the concern of passing off. Regardless of the effort and
                    skill put into coming up with the design feature, the said feature does not
                    automatically become an <em>indicator of trade origin</em>.
                    What is necessary for passing off is proof that the public perceives the design
                    feature to be an indicator of a particular trade origin. The design feature must
                    interact with the customer in such a way that it provides the customer with an
                    indicator of origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     To better understand what it means to perform
                    the function of being an indicator of trade origin, we may pause to consider the
                    role of brand names. The primary function or value of appending a brand name
                    onto a product is usually not to make the product look nice or functional. The
                    fundamental importance of a brand name resides in its role as an indicator of
                    trade origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     From the above discussion, it should be clear
                    that the tort of passing off is <em>exclusively</em>
                    concerned with protecting goodwill generated through the use of indicia of trade
                    origin. It is not concerned with protecting product design for its aesthetic or
                    functional value. If this were not so, the tort of passing off would be
                    encroaching into areas that are within the purview of industrial design
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It should be noted that alongside the common
                    law of passing off is a registration system for protecting trade marks, which
                    directly protects indicia of trade origin. Under s 2(1) of the Trade Marks Act
                    (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the TMA”), a “trade mark”
                    is defined as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [A]ny sign capable of being represented graphically and which is
                        capable of distinguishing goods or services dealt with or provided in the
                        course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided
                        by any other person ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     A “sign” is defined in s 2(1) of
                    the TMA as including: “any letter, word, name, signature, numeral,
                    device, brand, heading, label, ticket, shape, colour, aspect of packaging or any
                    combination thereof”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     At this juncture, I note in particular that
                    the protection trade mark law gives to the <em>shape</em>
                    of an article is very limited. Whilst the shape of an article can amount to a
                    “sign”, it is necessary to show that the “sign” is
                    capable of distinguishing goods or services in the course of trade from those of
                    any other person. Signs that are highly descriptive of the goods or services in
                    question may be rejected because they lack distinctiveness, <em>ie</em>, the capability to distinguish competing brands in the market
                    place. Some shapes may be excluded from registration as a trade mark because it
                    lacks distinctiveness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Moreover, even if the shape of a product is
                    found to possess the capability to distinguish, s 7(3) of the TMA sets out
                    important exclusions to the protection of shapes. It provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    A sign shall not be
                            registered as a trade mark if it consists exclusively of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Similar statutory provisions in the UK and
                    Europe have produced a considerable body of case law and academic discussion.
                    Whilst it is not necessary to discuss these developments, the point is that the
                    law has acted with considerable caution in conferring protection on the shape of
                    an article by means of trade mark registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The reluctance to grant trade mark protection
                    to the shape of products is an outworking of the legislative policy of not
                    easily granting monopolies over particular designs and features of goods.
                    Indeed, the policy considerations discussed in the UK and Europe are rooted in
                    the concern to ensure that trade mark law does not operate in an
                    anti-competitive manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     This anti-competitive concern has been
                    recognised in Singapore as well. In <em>Nation Fittings (M) Sdn
                        Bhd v Oystertec Plc and another Suit</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 712, Andrew
                    Phang J (as he then was) adopted a narrow interpretation of certain statutory
                    transitional provisions concerning whether a registered two-dimensional mark
                    could be treated as a three-dimensional mark under the TMA. The learned judge
                    expressed the view that an overly expansive approach to granting proprietors
                    trade mark protection might lead to the development of disguised monopolies that
                    may stifle or stymie the general public interest and welfare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In the present case, the plaintiffs do not
                    claim protection of the get-up and design features as “signs”
                    under the TMA. The claim is based solely on the tort of passing off.
                    Nevertheless, it is apparent that similar policy concerns relating to
                    competition arise. The tort of passing off is not about protecting design for
                    the sake of design. Passing off is concerned with preventing unfair competition
                    and is squarely centred on protecting goodwill established by the use of indicia
                    of trade origin in the market place. Bearing these concerns in mind, I now
                    proceed to discuss the law on passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Law on the tort of passing off</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The basic principles of the tort of passing
                    off are well established. The tort is concerned with protecting the goodwill of
                    a trader in his brand name and other indicia or badges of origin. The tort also
                    seeks to ensure transparency in the market place so that another trader does
                    not, whether by design or accident, sell his goods or services in a manner that
                    causes members of the public to be confused as to their origin. That said,
                    passing off is not a tort based simply on confusion or deception; nor has it
                    developed into an action that targets unfair competition <em>simpliciter</em>. Notwithstanding the considerable developments in
                    the tort over the past century, such as the recognition of shared goodwill,
                    deception as to quality, inverse passing off and the broader approaches to
                    determining the likelihood of deception and damage (especially where the
                    plaintiff and defendant are not in direct competition as such), the tort remains
                    true to its origin, which is to <em>protect the goodwill
                        belonging to the trader</em>.</p>

                        another</em> [1979] 1 AC 731 (“the <em>Advocaat</em> case”), a seminal decision on the tort of
                    passing off from the House of Lords in England, Lord Diplock held (at 742) that
                    there were five elements in an action for passing off. These are: (a) a
                    misrepresentation; (b) made by a trader in the course of trade; (c) to
                    prospective customers of goods and services supplied by him; (d) which is
                    calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense
                    that the injury is a reasonably foreseeable consequence); and (e) which causes
                    actual damage, or (in a <em>quia timet</em> action) is
                    likely to cause damage, to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom an
                    action is brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in <em>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc and others</em> [1990]
                    1 WLR 491 (“<em>Reckitt</em>”) at
                    499D–H reformulated the above statement of law in the <em>Advocaat</em> case, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general
                        proposition—no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More
                        specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the
                        plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are
                        three in number. First, he must establish a <b><em>goodwill or
                            reputation</em></b> attached to the goods or services which he
                        supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the
                        identifying "get-up" (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade
                        description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under
                        which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that
                        the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the
                        plaintiff's goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a <b><em>misrepresentation</em></b> by the defendant to the public
                        (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe
                        that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the
                        plaintiff ... Thirdly, he must demonstrate that <b><em>he
                            suffers or, in a quia timet action, that he is likely to suffer
                            damage</em></b> by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the
                        defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or
                        services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The three elements identified by Lord Oliver
                    in the tort of passing off, <em>ie</em>, goodwill,
                    misrepresentation, and damage, have been followed and applied consistently by
                    the Singapore courts: see in particular <em>Novelty v
                        Amanresorts</em> at [36]; <em>Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v
                        Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</em> [2013] 2
                    SLR 941 at [109]; and <em>Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v
                        Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another</em> [2015] 2 SLR
                    751.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Indeed, in accordance with this tripartite
                    framework, the plaintiffs’ first, and in my view, more straightforward
                    passing off claim, is founded on the following premises:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     The SINGSUNG Get-Up (described at
                        [53] above) enjoys goodwill in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was a misrepresentation such that the
                        trade buyers who directly purchased the 1st Defendant’s products were
                        deceived or are likely to have been deceived as to the origin of the
                        defendants’ goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_c"></a>(c)     As a result of the deception, the plaintiffs’
                        goodwill in Singapore is damaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Instruments of deception</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     However, as mentioned at [70(b)] above, the
                    plaintiff has a second passing off claim that does not (ultimately) depend on
                    goodwill or confusion in Singapore as such. Indeed, I recognise that there is a
                        <em>second type of passing off</em> that does not
                    depend on the defendant actually deceiving or confusing its direct consumers,
                    but that is premised on the defendant having circulated “instruments of
                    deception”. As the learned author of Christopher Wadlow, <em>The Law of Passing-Off: Unfair Competition by
                        Misrepresentation</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011)
                        (“<em>Wadlow on Passing Off</em>”) at
                    para 5-134 puts it:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The classic definition of passing-off in terms of a misrepresentation
                        made to customers or consumers is applicable without difficulty only to
                        retailers. Businesses higher up the chain of distribution, such as
                        manufacturers or importers, are, however, liable for passing-off in their
                        own right under a doctrine known as “instruments of
                        deception”. In its most basic form, this states that primary
                        liability for passing-off attaches to the business actually responsible for
                        goods which are inherently likely to deceive ultimate purchasers or
                        consumers. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Under the doctrine of “instruments of
                    deception”, passing off can be committed where instruments of deception
                    are supplied to a third party, even if the third party (the trade buyer or
                    middleman) is not deceived or confused. It is no defence for a manufacturer to
                    say that the retailer to whom he sold his products is not deceived. A
                    manufacturer who sells products which enable retailers to make false
                    representations to others can be liable in passing off. Passing off arises if
                    the plaintiff shows that the ultimate consumers would be confused into thinking
                    that they are acquiring the products of the plaintiff: James Mellor <em>et al</em>, <em>Kerly’s Law of Trade
                        Marks and Trade Names</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2014)
                        (“<em>Kerly</em>”) at
                    para 18-232.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     On one view, the tort of passing off is
                    complete when the goods are supplied to the wholesaler or retailer, although the
                    actual deception of customers and consequent damage may not occur until later,
                    or at all: <em>Wadlow on Passing Off</em> at
                    para 5-134, <em>Tan Tee Jim</em> at para 19.306.
                    A plaintiff therefore need not prove that the “instruments of
                    deception” actually reached ultimate consumers who were confused. It only
                    need show that the goods were supplied, or put into circulation. On the other
                    hand, <em>Kerly</em> at para 18-233 is of the view
                    that an instrument of deception is a misrepresentation waiting to happen which
                    only needs to be exposed to the ultimate consumer for the tort of passing off to
                    be complete. Whilst it is not essential that the question as to whether passing
                    off is complete by the mere act of supplying an instrument of deception to a
                    middleman (who is not himself deceived) is decided in the present case, I am of
                    the view that the claim is better seen as one brought on a <em>quia timet</em> basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I also note that passing off may take place
                    and be actionable in the home jurisdiction even if the instruments of deception
                    supplied in that jurisdiction are to be subsequently <em>exported</em> by the trade buyer: <em>John Walker
                        &amp; Sons Ltd and others v Henry Ost &amp; Co Ltd and another</em>
                    [1970] 1 WLR 917. In such a case, some authorities suggest that what must
                    ultimately be proved is that there is goodwill in the mark in the sense that the
                    mark is distinctive of the plaintiff in the <em>foreign
                        market</em> and misrepresentation has arisen in the <em>foreign market</em>. As stated in <em>Wadlow on
                        Passing Off</em> at para 5-152:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Under the doctrine of instruments of deception the tort of passing-off
                        is complete when deceptive goods are exported from or disposed of in
                        England, even though they may be destined for a foreign market. It is
                        necessary to prove that the goods are such as would deceive ultimate
                        purchasers in that market. <em>The claimant must therefore
                            prove that his mark (etc.) is distinctive in that market and that the
                            defendant’s conduct is calculated to deceive there.</em>
                        These are purely relevant as matters of fact: the claimant does not have to
                        prove that the defendant’s conduct infringes any local law. ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     While it may seem counter-intuitive that
                    passing off is also considered to have occurred in Singapore despite the fact
                    that the actual market where distinctiveness is ultimately in issue and where
                    the misrepresentation exists is an overseas market (<em>ie</em>, Cameroon in this case), the view may be taken that this
                    makes sense because the wrong lies in circulating “instruments of
                    deception” which <em>enable a middlemen or retailer to
                        pass off his goods in another market</em>. As long as the instruments
                    of deception are supplied in a particular jurisdiction, the tort on one view
                    takes place and is completed in that jurisdiction. At the very least, it is
                    sufficient for a <em>quia timet</em> action to be brought
                    in the jurisdiction where the instruments are supplied. The question remains,
                    however, whether it is necessary to also show that the instruments supplied are
                    instruments of deception in both the home jurisdiction (where the action is
                    brought) as well as the overseas market. This is discussed below at
                    [144].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The tortious wrong underlying this form of
                    passing off and the grant of relief is the <em>supply of
                        instruments of deception.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I turn now to the meaning of an
                    “instrument of deception”. In <em>British
                        Telecommunication plc and another v One in a Million Ltd and
                        others</em> [1999] 1 WLR 903, Aldous LJ helpfully explained at
                    920D–F that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Whether any name is an instrument of fraud will depend upon all the
                        circumstances. A name which will, by reason of its similarity to the name of
                        another, <em>inherently lead to passing off is such an
                            instrument</em>. <em>If it would not inherently
                            lead to passing off, it does not follow that it is not an instrument of
                            fraud. The court should consider the similarity of the names, the
                            intention of the defendant, the type of trade and all the surrounding
                            circumstances.</em> If it be the intention of the defendant to
                        appropriate the goodwill of another or enable others to do so, I can see no
                        reason why the court should not infer that it will happen, even if there is
                        a possibility that such an appropriation would not take place. If, taking
                        all the circumstances into account the court should conclude that the name
                        was produced to enable passing off, is <em>adapted to be used
                            for passing off</em> and, if used, is likely to be fraudulently
                        used, an injunction will be appropriate. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    From the above passage, it is clear that
                    there are instruments which would “inherently lead to passing
                    off”, and goods which may not “inherently lead to passing
                    off”, but may nevertheless be “adapted to be used for passing
                    off”. As the learned author of <em>Wadlow on Passing
                        Off</em> states at para 5-141, goods which are “inherently
                    deceptive” are goods which carry indicia so close to what is distinctive
                    of the claimant that the public is bound to be deceived unless specific remedial
                    or differentiating measures are taken. On the other hand, where the goods
                    supplied fall just short of being inherently deceptive, but nevertheless can
                    easily, by means of a misrepresentation of the retailer, become deceptive, the
                    supplier may still be liable if he provided the goods with the <em>intention</em> that they will be passed off by retailers. In
                    such a case, the supplier’s liability flows from the doctrine of joint
                    tortfeasorship (with the retailer).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Take for example the South African decision
                    in <em>Omega, Louis Brandt et Frère SA and Another v African
                        Textile Distributors</em> (1982) (1) TPD 951 (“<em>Omega</em>”). The case involved rights over the
                    well-known trade mark “OMEGA” for watches in South Africa. The
                    plaintiff’s basic complaint was that the defendant was selling watches
                    branded “HOMEGAS”. Traders (hawkers) who bought the watches for
                    retail sale were able to remove the alphabets “H” and
                    “S” with the result that the watches now bore the
                    “OMEGA” brand. The hawkers sold these altered watches to members
                    of the public. The South African court had to decide whether the defendant (as a
                    wholesaler) was liable in passing off for supplying “HOMEGAS”
                    watches when these watches were not instruments of fraud <em>per
                        se</em>. The brand “HOMEGAS” was not so close to
                    “OMEGA” as to be likely to cause deception <em>on
                        its own</em>. There was evidence, however, that the defendant knew
                    that some of the hawkers removed the letters “H” and
                    “S”. The defendant also sold a special tool for removing the watch
                    crystals, thereby aiding the hawkers in altering the brand embossed on the watch
                    face. There was also evidence that the defendant had used the same technique in
                    respect of watches bearing other brands. The Transvaal Provincial Division
                    court, on appeal, granted a temporary interdict (injunction). There was
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the defendant knew
                    that some of its customers were in the habit of removing the letters
                    “H” and “S”, and that the maker of the watches had
                    deliberately chosen the “HOMEGAS” brand for this purpose. Even
                    though the defendant did not put the “OMEGA” brand on its watches,
                    the court accepted that the defendant was aware of what the hawkers were doing.
                    In these circumstances, the court, citing English authorities, held that the
                    plaintiff was entitled to an interlocutory injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In <em>Omega</em>, the
                    defendant put into the hands of the retailers a product which, whilst not an
                    instrument of deception in its own right, could be converted into an instrument
                    of fraud by a simple operation. Indeed, the defendants supplied the product with
                    the knowledge that some of its retail customers were doing that. Given evidence
                    that the defendant also sold a device used to facilitate the brand conversion
                    (removal of the watch crystal), together with the similar-fact evidence that the
                    defendant had done this on several previous occasions (in respect of other
                    well-known brands), it was not surprising that interlocutory relief was granted.
                    Whilst the South African court did not set out in detail the legal principles it
                    relied on, it is apparent that a case of <em>prima
                        facie</em> liability had been established on the basis of joint
                    tortfeasorship (more specifically, assisting the commission of a tort), rather
                    than on the basis of primary infringement: <em>Omega</em>
                    at 57A; and <em>Wadlow on Passing Off</em> at
                    para 5-148.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Having said all that I have said above, I
                    also acknowledge that there are hardly any goods in existence which cannot be
                    used in a deceptive manner by someone determined to do so: <em>Wadlow on Passing Off</em> at para 5-147. For this reason, the
                    evidence of the surrounding circumstances is critical where we are dealing with
                    goods that are not instruments of deception in their own right. Important
                    considerations a court must take into account include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     how close the alleged spurious
                        goods are to being regarded as instruments of fraud in their own right (in
                        respect of the indicia of trade origin);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     the relationship between the supplier and the
                        retailers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the supplier has knowledge that the goods supplied are being used
                        deceptively;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether the supplier has provided any other assistance to his customers to
                        convert the goods into instruments of fraud; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether the supplier has encouraged
                        the retailers to acquire his goods for the purpose of passing
                    off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I now summarise a number of general
                    principles which may be gleaned from the above discussion on instruments of
                    deception and the law of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, supplying an instrument of
                        deception is but one method of committing the tort of passing off. The
                        elements of the tort must still be satisfied, <em>ie</em>, a plaintiff must show there is goodwill, there would be
                        a misrepresentation when the ultimate consumers purchase the goods, and
                        there is or would be damage or the likelihood of damage to goodwill, albeit
                        in a foreign market if the instruments of deception are to be exported. The
                        key question in cases where the instrument of deception is intended to be
                        exported to a foreign market is whether the relevant indicia of origin has
                        acquired a reputation (distinctiveness) such that there is a likelihood of
                        deception in that market. If the plaintiff does not have goodwill in the
                        relevant market, there is no question of passing off being committed via
                        instruments of deception (or in any manner at all). Further, the alleged
                        instrument of deception must relate to the indicia of trade origin the use
                        of which has generated the plaintiff goodwill. Passing off is not a tort
                        founded on deception or confusion <em>simpliciter</em>.
                        It is, and has always been, founded on goodwill. In <em>Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd and others v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd</em>
                        [1981] 1 WLR 193 (“<em>Cadbury-Schweppes</em>”), the plaintiff’s business was
                        clearly affected by the entry of the defendant’s goods into the same
                        market. The claim failed because the defendant did not copy any indicia of
                        trade origin which had become part of the goodwill of the product. The
                        defendant’s products, while substantially the same both in terms of
                        the actual product, the packaging, and the marketing, were not instruments
                        of deception because the claimed get-up, <em>etc</em>,
                        had not become part of the goodwill in the product.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, assuming goodwill, once the
                        defendant supplies a middleman with an instrument of deception in relation
                        to that goodwill, the plaintiff (owner of the goodwill) will have the right
                        to an injunction even if the middleman has not completed the tort by selling
                        the deceptive goods to the public. In such a case, an injunction on a
                            <em>quia timet</em> basis may be
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        assuming goodwill, primary liability for passing off can arise where the
                        defendant supplies inherently deceptive products to the middleman to commit
                        passing off. However, if the defendant also had knowledge that the middleman
                        intends to use those means to commit passing off, the defendant will also be
                        liable as a joint tortfeasor for the acts of passing off committed by the
                        middleman or retailer. For example, if X supplies to Y labels bearing the
                        plaintiff’s trade mark for chilli sauce and containers on which the
                        labels are to be affixed, on the understanding and knowing and intending Y
                        to apply the labels and fill the containers with his own chilli sauce for
                        sale to customers, there is no doubt that X and Y are joint
                        tortfeasors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, assuming goodwill and proof that the defendant has supplied an
                        instrument of deception to a middleman, liability will arise even if the
                        deceptive goods are intended for sale and are in fact sold to consumers in
                        an overseas market. Of course, it is necessary to show that customers in
                        that foreign country are deceived or likely to be deceived as to the trade
                        origin of the goods. In such a case, provided the transaction between the
                        defendant and the middleman takes place in Singapore, the law regards the
                        tort as being committed in Singapore (and actionable in some cases on a
                            <em>quia timet</em> basis). That said, even if the
                        circumstances are such that the tort is wholly committed overseas (<em>ie</em>, it is a foreign tort), the possibility remains
                        of bringing a suit in Singapore under the rules of private international
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth,
                        liability can still arise where the goods which, whilst not instruments of
                        deception in their own right, are near instruments of deception and have
                        been supplied in circumstances (<em>eg</em>, with the
                        requisite knowledge and intent) such as to render the supplier a joint
                        tortfeasor with the retailer who uses the goods to commit passing off. In
                        the present case, there is no evidence that the defendants’ direct
                        customers (<em>ie</em>, the middlemen) have used the
                        defendants’ goods to commit passing off. On the evidence before the
                        court, no action for passing off has been brought against any of the
                        defendants’ customers or indeed, any retailers of “LS”
                        branded products.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Goodwill </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I next consider the law on goodwill. In
                        <em>The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Muller &amp;
                        Co’s Margarine Limited</em> [1901] AC 217 at 223–224, the
                    House of Lords defined goodwill as “the benefit and advantage of the good
                    name, reputation and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which
                    brings in custom...”. The Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Novelty v Amanresorts</em> at [39] took a similar approach and
                    identified two essential features of goodwill:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... First, it is the association of a good, service or business on which
                        the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, <em>etc</em> (referred to generically as the plaintiff’s
                        “get-up”) has been applied with a particular source. Second,
                        this association is “an attractive force which brings in
                        custom” ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Not only must a plaintiff prove that it has
                    a business with customers, it must also show the marks, get-up, or design (or
                    whatever it may be) that the plaintiff desires to protect is an
                    “attractive force” (much like a magnet) which brings custom to
                    that business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Practically, a plaintiff seeking to
                    establish that it owns goodwill must prove that the public recognises use of the
                    claimed brand name, logo, colour scheme, get-up, slogan, shape, <em>etc</em>, as serving the purpose of an indicator of origin.
                    The public must regard goods or services with the claimed mark as coming from a
                    particular source (manufacturer, retailer, service provider and so forth).
                    Applying this principle to the present case, the plaintiffs bear the burden of
                    proving that the SINGSUNG Get-Up has generated goodwill on the part of the
                    Singapore public (or at least a section of it). To be clear, the mark or get-up
                        <em>etc</em>. must be attached to the goods or services
                    by association such that these are recognised by the public as distinctive
                    specifically of a plaintiff’s goods or services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Goodwill is usually established by evidence
                    of use, advertising expenditure promoting the indicia of origin, as well as
                    market surveys. The law of passing off frequently protects the brand name of the
                    product, given that it is usually quite easy to establish that the brand name is
                    an indicator of origin and hence generates goodwill. However, this does not mean
                    that the shape or get-up of a product (being an aspect of the product itself),
                    or the advertising slogans used with it, can never be protected by the tort of
                    passing off. What it does mean is that the court will examine the evidence on
                    these other aspects of the product with care before deciding whether customers
                    (the market) recognise these features as being distinctive of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    At this juncture, I note that courts have
                    been cautious in the face of claims that get-up, product design or slogans
                    (rather than the brand name) have become generators of the goodwill of a
                    business. Given that the plaintiffs’ claims in this case relate to
                    precisely that, I shall discuss in slightly more detail the case law on the
                    extent to which the shape and get-up of a product, or even certain slogans used
                    by the business to advertise the product, can be part of the goodwill, and hence
                    protected under the law of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    
          <em>White Hudson &amp; Co v
                        Asian Organisation Ltd</em> [1965] MLJ 186 (Privy Council on appeal
                    from Singapore) is a well-known case where the plaintiff succeeded in
                    establishing goodwill in the colour of packaging of the product. Despite the
                    fact that the plaintiff and the defendant had different brand names, the
                    plaintiff succeeded in his claim for passing off based on his use of red paper
                    wrapping for cough sweets. The evidence showed that members of the public in
                    Singapore at that time usually referred to the plaintiff’s sweets as
                    “red paper wrapped sweets” in Chinese, rather than by its English
                    brand name, “Hacks”. This finding was supported by evidence that
                    the plaintiff’s Singapore customers at that time were not fluent in
                    English, and hence used the colour of the wrapper to identify the
                    product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Yet another case where goodwill was found to
                    subsist in the shape of a container for a product is the House of Lord’s
                        <em>Reckitt</em> decision. The plaintiff sold fresh,
                    natural lemon juice in a lemon-shaped container with a green screw top and a
                    label attached to the neck. The plaintiff had, for 30 years, been the only
                    manufacturer using this type of container and get-up. The plaintiff’s
                    brand name was “JIF”. The defendant also sold fresh lemon juice in
                    a similarly shaped and coloured container, with a label attached to the neck
                    containing its brand name “REALEMON”. The defendant challenged,
                    among other things, the existence of goodwill in the shape and colour of the
                    lemon juice container. The get-up was said to be descriptive of the product both
                    in terms of shape and colour. The trial judge, Court of Appeal and House of
                    Lords in the UK found that the shape of the container had acquired a secondary
                    meaning that was distinctive of the plaintiff. The trial judge had found that
                    many members of the public (<em>eg</em>, housewives) would
                    buy the defendant’s product thinking that it was the plaintiff’s. On
                    this basis, Lord Oliver found that the shape of the container was a generator of
                    goodwill. The shape did more than just indicate that the container contained
                    lemon juice. It indicated that the container contained “JIF” lemon
                    juice. The shape and get-up had become associated in the minds of substantial
                    numbers of the relevant public exclusively with JIF lemon juice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    There are, of course, many cases where the
                    claim that the shape of a product enjoys goodwill has failed. The plaintiff in
                    the English case <em>Hodgkinson &amp; Corby Ltd and another v
                        Wards Mobility Services Ltd (No 1)</em> [1994] 1 WLR 1564 sold a
                    cushion for preventing sores on wheel chair bound individuals. The plaintiff
                    claimed that the cushion had “a striking and memorable shape”, and
                    that the shape of the cushion was protected as part of the goodwill. Goodwill in
                    this case was asserted over the shape of the product, rather than a container.
                    The brand name of the plaintiff’s cushion was “Roho”. The
                    defendant made a “look alike” under the brand
                    “Flo’tair”. The action for passing off failed. The court was
                    of the view that customers bought the cushion for what it was. They did not rely
                    on the shape as an indicator of trade origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Another decision is the English High Court
                    decision in <em>Yakult Honsha KK’s Trade Mark
                        Application</em> [2001] RPC 39 (“the <em>Yakult</em> case”). In this case, the applicant tried to
                    register the shape of a bottle used to contain cultured milk as a trade mark.
                        <em>The court held that the average consumer was likely to
                        conclude that the shape of the bottle in question was nothing more than a
                        bottle of fairly ordinary shape. There was no evidence in the sales
                        promotion efforts that effort was made to specifically promote the shape of
                        the bottle as having trade mark significance. There was nothing to suggest
                        that at date of the application, the applicant had done anything to educate
                        the public that its cultured milk bottles had trade mark significance. There
                        was also no evidence that the public had learned of such significance (ie,
                        treated the shape of the bottle as an indicator of trade origin) apart from
                        the applicant's marketing efforts. Laddie J noted (at [10]) that learned
                        counsel</em>, Mr Simon Thorley QC, had rightly conceded that the fact
                    that a container is unusual or attractive does not, <em>per
                        se</em>, mean that the public will view and rely on it as an indicator
                    of origin. The relevant question is not whether the public recognises the
                    container on seeing it a second time, or in other words, whether it is
                    memorable. The relevant question is “whether by itself its appearance
                    would convey trade mark significance to the average
                customer.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Whilst the court’s remarks in the
                        <em>Yakult</em> case were made in the context of a
                    registered trade mark, the general principle is broadly similar in a passing off
                    action. In the law of trade mark what is protected is the trade mark. In the
                    case of passing off what is protected is the goodwill enjoyed by the plaintiff
                    in his goods or services. To succeed in passing off, the plaintiff must show
                    that the name, get-up, shape, <em>etc</em>, has become
                    distinctive in the market in that the public associate the name, get-up, shape,
                        <em>etc</em>, exclusively with the plaintiff. If so,
                    the feature is a generator of goodwill and is protected in the sense that it is
                    a part of the goodwill. Whilst registered trade mark is concerned with
                    protecting a trade marks as a species of property, the tort of passing off is
                    concerned with protecting goodwill as a species of property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Reference can also be helpfully made to the
                    decision of FA Chua J in <em>Malaysia Dairy Industries Pte Ltd
                        and another v Yakult (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 211.
                    This case also concerned the shape of the bottle used for a cultured milk drink.
                    The plaintiff (owner of the “VITAGEN” brand) applied for an
                    interlocutory injunction against the defendant, who used a similarly shaped
                    bottle for its cultured milk drink. The application was denied because,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the court was not satisfied that
                    the shape of the Vitagen container had become (by use or otherwise) associated
                    exclusively with the plaintiff’s lactic acid drink such that that the use
                    of a similarly shaped bottle would be understood by the trade and public in
                    Singapore as meaning that the goods were the goods of the plaintiff and no one
                    else’s. On the facts (as they appeared at the interlocutory stage), Chua J
                    found that the respective brand names (“YAKULT” and
                    “VITAGEN”) were more important than the shape. The brand names had
                    featured prominently in the advertising, but the advertising neither emphasised
                    the shape of the container, nor taught the public that they could identify the
                    product by the shape of the container. The shape of the bottle therefore did not
                    generate goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Just as the courts exercise care where
                    goodwill is claimed in respect of the shape of a product, care is also exercised
                    where goodwill is claimed in respect of advertising slogans or the image of a
                    product or service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In <em>Cadbury-Schweppes</em>, the Privy Council, on appeal from Australia,
                    found that the plaintiff had not established that the get-up and the slogan used
                    to market the product was part of the goodwill or had generated goodwill. The
                    plaintiff’s product was a soft drink based on lemon squash. It was
                    launched with a heavy advertising campaign, which promoted the soft drink as a
                    masculine alternative to beer. The plaintiff’s brand name was
                    “Solo”. The drink was sold in green and yellow cans with a
                    medallion type label similar to ones commonly found on beer cans. The
                    advertising campaign stressed the theme of ruggedness and the great outdoors.
                    Slogans used included: “Just Like the great old Pub Squashes of
                    Yesteryear”. The plaintiff’s claim was that the defendant took
                    advantage of the new market opened up by the plaintiff. The defendant made a
                    similar lemon squash drink under the brand “Pub Squash”, used a
                    can of similar colour with a medallion label, and promoted its drink with
                    similar advertising themes of heroic masculinity and “stalwart
                    men”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The passing off action failed. The parties
                    had completely different brand names, and the plaintiff was not able to show
                    that the advertising themes, slogans, or the can colour played a part in
                    generating goodwill. The court found that the slogans were not distinctive of
                    plaintiff (in the sense of an exclusive association). It followed that there was
                    no misrepresentation in the sense required by passing off. In response to the
                    argument that the acts of the defendant were unfair as they were taking
                    advantage of a new market that had been opened up by the plaintiff, the Privy
                    Council held (at 200F–G):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [C]ompetition must remain free: and competition is safeguarded by the
                        necessity for a plaintiff to prove that he has built up an ‘intangible
                        property right’ in the advertised descriptions of his product: or, in
                        other words, that he has succeeded by such methods in giving his product a
                        distinctive character accepted by the market. A defendant, however, does no
                        wrong by entering a market created by another and there competing with its
                        creator. The line may be difficult to draw: but unless it is drawn,
                        competition will be stifled. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The Privy Council noted (at 205H) that if
                    the law did not draw the line, the danger is that “[t]he new, small man
                    would increasingly find his entry into an existing market obstructed by the
                    large traders already well known as operating in it”. These are
                    sentiments that I fully agree with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The above cases show that whilst it is
                    possible to claim that descriptive get-up, shapes or colour of products, or
                    advertising slogans have acquired a secondary signification (as an indicator of
                    trade origin), the court will scrutinise such claims carefully. Importantly, a
                    claimant must prove that a substantial portion of the members of the public do
                    indeed view the claimed generators of goodwill as distinctive of the plaintiff.
                    This is a question of <em>fact</em>. Sufficient evidence is
                    needed to convince the court that such a factual conclusion is
                merited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The final point I make in relation to
                    goodwill for now is that the task of establishing goodwill in words or marks
                    that are <em>essentially descriptive</em> of a product or
                    service is tricky, but not impossible. This is illustrated by cases such as
                        <em>Frank Reddaway and Frank Reddaway &amp; Co Limited v
                        George Banham and George Banham &amp; Co Limited</em> [1896] AC 199
                        (“<em>Reddaway</em>”); <em>Mechanical Handling Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Material Handling Engineering
                        Pte Ltd and another</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 365; <em>Super
                        Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte Ltd and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 214; <em>Lifestyle 1.99 Pte
                        Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as One.99 Shop)</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R)
                    687; and <em>Ozone Community Corp v Advance Magazine Publishers
                        Inc</em> [2010] 2 SLR 459.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Bearing the above cases, policy
                    considerations, and principles in mind, I turn now to consider the
                    plaintiffs’ straightforward passing off claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Straightforward passing off claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    As stated at [94] above, the
                    plaintiffs’ straightforward passing off claim is based on the following
                    premises:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_a"></a>(a)     The SINGSUNG Get-Up (described at
                        [53] above) enjoys goodwill in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was a misrepresentation such that the
                        trade buyers who directly purchased the 1st Defendant’s products were
                        deceived or are likely to have been deceived as to the origin of the
                        defendants’ goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_c"></a>(c)     As a result of the deception, the plaintiffs’
                        goodwill in Singapore is damaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Goodwill in Singapore </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    As discussed above, in order to prove
                    goodwill in Singapore, a plaintiff must prove that it has business within
                    jurisdiction, and that its mark or get-up is an attractive force that brings in
                    custom. The latter requires proof that the mark or get-up is an attractive force
                    in the minds of the public. By attractive force, I stress again that it is not
                    enough that the public finds the get-up aesthetically attractive or functionally
                    useful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Proof of business within jurisdiction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In determining whether the 1st Plaintiff
                    enjoys goodwill in Singapore, the first thing I must consider is whether there
                    is proof of a business within jurisdiction: Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <em>Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore</em>, (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2nd Ed, 2014) (“<em>Law of Intellectual Property of
                        Singapore</em>”) at section 17.4. I note in passing the
                    recent decision of the UK Supreme Court in <em>Starbucks
                        (HK)</em>, and its review of case law on whether it was still
                    necessary to establish a business within jurisdiction before goodwill can be
                    found to subsist. In Singapore, as the law currently stands, it is clear that
                    goodwill requires proof that the plaintiff has business activity in Singapore.
                    Reputation alone is not sufficient. That said, it may be sufficient if there is
                    substantial pre-business activity such as heavy advertising campaigns intended
                    to familiarise the public with the product or service (see the views in
                        <em>Staywell</em> and <em>CDL Hotels
                        International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 975,
                    and compare <em>Starbucks (HK)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Whilst there remains some uncertainty over
                    what constitutes sufficient business or trading activity such as to be capable
                    of forming the basis of a claim to goodwill in law, I am of the view that the
                    plaintiffs have established that they have a sufficient business in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Evidence was given of the sales volume that
                    the 1st Plaintiff has achieved in Singapore. The sales volume to overseas trade
                    buyers, such as GEN, is considerable. Whilst there is some dispute and
                    uncertainty as to how and where the plaintiffs dealt with the overseas trade
                    buyers, I am satisfied that overseas trade buyers have placed significant orders
                    with the 1st Plaintiff in Singapore. For this reason, I have no doubt that the
                    1st Plaintiff has established a business within jurisdiction on which he can try
                    to mount a claim for goodwill in its indicators of trade origin. Whether all the
                    claimed features of get-up, <em>etc</em>, are in fact
                    relevant as generators of the goodwill is another matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In coming to the decision that the 1st
                    Plaintiff has sufficient business within jurisdiction, I took into account the
                    decision of Judith Prakash J in <em>Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v
                        Tong Seng Produce Pte Ltd</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 797 (“<em>Future Enterprises</em>”). In that case, the
                    plaintiff, a Singapore company, manufactured coffee in Singapore for export and
                    sale to overseas markets (in particular, Russia). The plaintiff’s products
                    were not available anywhere in Singapore. There was no evidence of any
                    “local sales”. In other words, the plaintiff had no local
                    consumers—its end users were all overseas. Indeed, the court found (at
                    [36]) that there was no evidence of any export trade community in Singapore
                    among which the plaintiff’s brand enjoyed goodwill. In these
                    circumstances, it is not surprising that the court concluded (at [42]) that the
                    plaintiff had not proven that it enjoyed a sufficient reputation and goodwill in
                    Singapore to found an action for passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In the present case, there is evidence that
                    the overseas trade buyers (from Cameroon, <em>etc</em>)
                    attended at the 1st Plaintiff’s shop in Singapore. As overseas trade
                    customers coming to Singapore, they are still customers <em>in
                        Singapore</em>. Products were selected and orders were placed in
                    Singapore. Furthermore, in the present case, unlike <em>Future
                        Enterprises</em>, there is evidence of some sales to local,
                    Singapore-based customers. Whilst the sales volume to Singapore customers is
                    very much smaller, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have sufficient business
                    in Singapore on which they can mount a claim to goodwill. What is critical is
                    whether the plaintiffs are able to establish reputation in the claimed get-up,
                        <em>etc</em>. In coming to this conclusion, I am also
                    assisted by the remarks of Lord Neuberger in <em>Starbucks
                        (HK)</em> at [52] that goodwill requires proof of customers within
                    jurisdiction as opposed to people in jurisdiction who happened to be customers
                    elsewhere. Even though the UK Supreme Court maintained the view that reputation
                    alone was insufficient to found an action for passing-off, Lord Neuberger
                    accepted that it may be sufficient if there was a booking office within
                    jurisdiction whereby people within jurisdiction obtained the right to receive
                    the plaintiff’s services abroad. Whilst this statement was made in respect
                    of hotel services, the statement must be applicable to goods as well. In the
                    present case, the 1st Plaintiff has a real business presence in Singapore with
                    actual customers doing business in Singapore (although the latter are
                    predominantly whole sale buyers from overseas).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   SINGSUNG Get-Up being an indicator of trade origin in
                Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Besides proving that the 1st Plaintiff has a
                    sufficient business in Singapore, the plaintiffs must also prove that the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up is perceived to be an indicator of trade origin (distinctive of
                    the first plaintiff) in Singapore. This is a question of fact and
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    On the whole, the evidence of sales to
                    Singapore-based customers was thin. There was some evidence of sales statistics
                    to Singapore-based customers. However, there was no further evidence to prove
                    that those statistics related to Singapore-based end user consumers. In fact,
                    the defendants strongly disputed that the 1st Plaintiff had any Singapore-based
                    end user consumers. In any event, even assuming that the 1st Plaintiff did make
                    sales to Singapore-based end user consumers, the statistics show that the volume
                    of such sales was much smaller.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Most crucial to my mind, however, is the
                    complete absence of evidence that the local buyers had come to associate the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up exclusively with the plaintiffs. No Singaporean customer gave
                    evidence on any of these matters. I thus find myself compelled to conclude that
                    there is no basis for a finding that the SINGSUNG Get-Up is regarded as
                    distinctive of the 1st Plaintiff among members of the Singapore
                public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Of course, goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up
                    need not be enjoyed in the eyes of the public at large. It can be sufficient for
                    goodwill to exist among a small section of society or a class of the public:
                        <em>Novelty v Amanresorts</em> at [44]. The plaintiffs
                    could perhaps argue that the SINGSUNG Get-Up enjoyed goodwill in Singapore among
                    the small group of trade buyers who purchased the 1st Plaintiff’s goods.
                    Indeed, it is clear that the 1st Plaintiff did have a number of overseas trade
                    buyer customers. However, it seems that most of these trade customers (<em>eg</em>, GEN) were aware that the 1st Plaintiff and 1st
                    Defendant are separate companies competing in the same line of products. They
                    are familiar with the two brand names, and are fully aware of the similarity in
                    the parties’ products. In any case, there was insufficient evidence of
                    confusion on the part of the trade customers. Whilst two trade buyers from
                    Cameroon gave evidence of their buying trips to Singapore, it does not appear
                    that either placed reliance on the <em>get-up</em> of
                    either the plaintiffs’ or defendants’ products as indicators of
                    trade origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    As such, it cannot be said that these trade
                    customers treat the SINGSUNG Get-Up as an indicator of trade origin. It would be
                    foolish to do so, given that they know the 1st Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant
                    carry similar (and occasionally near-identical) products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Perhaps, the most that can be said, and
                    indeed very fairly said, is that goodwill exists in the “SINGSUNG”
                    brand. However, this is very different from stating that the SINGSUNG Get-Up is
                    treated as an indicator of trade origin, and hence generates goodwill. In my
                    view, there is simply no evidence that the SINGSUNG Get-Up is treated as an
                    indicator of trade origin by any sector of the public in Singapore. I thus find
                    that goodwill does not exist in the SINGSUNG Get-Up, even in the eyes of this
                    small group of trade customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Misrepresentation and damage in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Given my conclusion that the SINGSUNG Get-Up
                    does not enjoy goodwill in Singapore, the straightforward passing off claim must
                    fail. It is unnecessary for me to consider misrepresentation and
                damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Nevertheless, I point out that given the
                    prominence of the 1st Plaintiff’s and 1st Defendant’s different
                    brands on their respective products, and given that there can be no claim to
                    illiteracy on the part of the 1st Plaintiff’s and 1st Defendant’s
                    overseas trade buyers, it is highly unlikely that any trade buyer would be
                    confused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Passing off based on instruments of deception</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    As mentioned above, there is a second type
                    of passing off claimed—that based on the doctrine of instruments of
                    deception. As discussed, a plaintiff must show that a defendant did supply the
                    alleged instruments of deception, and that the products are indeed instruments
                    of deception. The latter involves either showing that the goods are inherently
                    deceptive, or if they fall just short of being inherently deceptive, showing
                    that the defendant knew or intended that the goods be adapted by the retailer
                    for the purposes of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    In this case, it is not in dispute that the
                    alleged instruments of deception have been supplied by the defendant. The only
                    question is whether the 1st Defendant’s products which are in question are
                    instruments of deception. At this point, I reiterate the following points which
                    I made above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_a"></a>(a)     If the plaintiff does not have
                        goodwill in the relevant jurisdiction, there is no question of passing off
                        being committed via instruments of deception (or in any manner at
                        all).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        alleged instrument of deception must relate to the indicia of trade origin
                        in respect of which the plaintiff has goodwill. In other words, the
                        deception alleged must arise in respect of the mark, get-up <em>etc</em>. which has become exclusively associated with
                        the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The important preliminary question is the
                    identity of the relevant jurisdiction. Where an alleged instrument of deception
                    is supplied to a trader in Singapore for use in an export market, is it
                    necessary to establish that the plaintiff enjoys goodwill in Singapore and that
                    the instrument supplied is <em>also</em> an instrument
                    deception in Singapore? I have found that whilst goodwill subsists in the
                    SINGSUNG brand, there is no evidence that the get-up is treated as an indicator
                    of origin by any sector of the public in Singapore. It follows that there is no
                    evidence that the products were instruments of deception in Singapore. It may be
                    thought that in such a case, it is not necessary to consider whether the get-up
                    is seen as distinctive of the plaintiff in the export market (Cameroon). Even if
                    it is treated as such in the overseas market, it may be suggested that this
                    makes no difference given that they are not instruments of deception in
                    Singapore, where the suit is brought. Indeed, whilst the UK Supreme Court in
                        <em>Starbucks (HK)</em> was not dealing with a case of
                    exports of instruments of deception, it was said at [53] that the English court
                    in a passing off action in the UK had to be satisfied that the plaintiff’s
                    business has goodwill within its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The difficulty, however, is the decision of
                    the English High Court in <em>Modus Vivendi plc v Keen (World
                        Marketing Ltd)</em> (5 July 1995) (unreported) (“<em>Modus Vivendi</em>”). In that case, a passing off
                    action was brought in the UK in respect of cans of butane gas made in England
                    and exported for sale in China. The claim was based on similarities in the
                    get-up and not brand names. Lightman J, in finding for the plaintiff (after a
                    ten-day trial), commented:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is perhaps somewhat surprising that a trial as to the existence of
                        Ronson’s goodwill in China and as to whether customers in China have
                        been misled by [the defendant] should be tried in England according to
                        principles of English law, and that there has been no trial before a court
                        in China or (at this trial) any references to the law of China. But this is
                        because [the defendant’s cans] were manufactured in England and sold
                        to [the defendant’s] exclusive distributor in Hong Kong for onward
                        sale to and in China, and in these circumstances, if Ronson’s
                        allegations are true, since ‘the instruments of deception’
                        (Keen’s cans) were put into circulation in this jurisdiction, under
                        English law the tort of passing-off has been committed in England, though
                        the damage, in respect of which compensation is sought ... has been suffered
                        outside the jurisdiction ie. in China. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The facts and issues concerning the get-up
                    in <em>Modus Vivendi</em> are considered at
                    [224]–[225] below. What is significant is that the court, in deciding for
                    the plaintiff, focused its discussion primarily on the market in China.
                    Specifically, the court considered whether the plaintiff’s get-up were
                    indicators of origin in China and protected by goodwill in that market. There
                    was no consideration as to whether the get-up was regarded as an indicator of
                    origin (associated exclusively with the plaintiff) in the UK market. What was
                    said was that the Ronson brand name enjoyed substantial goodwill in the UK for
                    its products which included cans of butane gas refills. That said, the focus was
                    on whether goodwill in the cans and a misrepresentation (constituted by the
                    defendant’s get-up and cans) existed in China. The problem, however, is
                    that what is required is that the instruments supplied in jurisdiction are
                    instruments <em>of deception</em>. It may be argued that it
                    is also necessary to establish that the supplied goods are instruments of
                    deception in the country of supply where the suit is brought. After all,
                    goodwill is territorial in nature. It may be that the court in <em>Modus Vivendi</em> proceeded on the basis that the get-up was
                    indeed also associated exclusively with Ronson (although this was not expressly
                    mentioned) in the UK. Given the importance of this point and the submissions, I
                    will in the paragraphs that follow ([147]–[219]), examine the position of
                    the get-up, <em>etc</em>, in Cameroon with a view to
                    determining whether these were associated in that market exclusively with the
                    1st Plaintiff such as to make the goods supplied instruments of deception in
                    that market. To be clear, I state at the outset that even if it is not necessary
                    to show that the supplied instruments are instruments of deception in the
                    country of supply and where the suit is brought (Singapore), this makes no
                    difference on the actual facts to my final decision since I am (for reasons
                    discussed below) of the view that any goodwill that the Plaintiffs enjoyed in
                    Cameroon does not in any case protect the get-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    In this case, following <em>Modus Vivendi</em>, the relevant jurisdiction in question is
                    Cameroon. This is where the alleged “instruments of deception”
                        (<em>ie</em>, the 1st Defendant’s products) were
                    exported and allegedly caused confusion. While there was some assertion that the
                    1st Plaintiff did export its products to other foreign markets, the evidence on
                    the goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up related only to the Cameroon market. As
                    such, I confine any findings I make to that market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I shall first consider if the SINGSUNG
                    Get-Up enjoys goodwill in the Cameroon market in the sense that the get-up has
                    become associated exclusively in the minds of the public with the 1st Plaintiff.
                    If it does, I then consider if the 1st Defendant’s products are
                    instruments of deception in that they effectively misrepresent themselves to be
                    the 1st Plaintiff’s goods to the public in Cameroon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Goodwill in Cameroon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    It is undisputed the 1st Plaintiff’s
                    products are sold in Cameroon. The key question is therefore whether the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up has acquired a reputation and distinctiveness in
                    Cameroon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    I first broadly explain my conclusions on
                    the evidence relating to whether the SINGSUNG Get-Up is viewed as an indicator
                    of trade origin in Cameroon. I then go into detail on the evidence presented on
                    each aspect of the SINGSUNG Get-Up. It might be helpful (again) for me to state
                    upfront, that I ultimately conclude that the plaintiffs have not provided
                    sufficient evidence to justify a factual finding that members of the public in
                    Cameroon view the SINGSUNG Get-Up as distinctive of the 1st Plaintiff. Indeed,
                    there is no basis for finding that the 1st Defendant’s get-up amounts to a
                    misrepresentation. This, to my mind, is fatal to the plaintiffs’ claim for
                    liability under the doctrine of instruments of deception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The plaintiffs’ evidence that the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up has generated goodwill consists mainly of assertions by the 2nd
                    Plaintiff and GEN (the plaintiffs’ customer who imported the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s goods into Cameroon) that end user purchasers (<em>eg</em>, housewives) in Cameroon were not fluent in English,
                    and would therefore identify the 1st Plaintiff’s products by reference to
                    the get-up and design rather than by its brand name
                        “SINGSUNG”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> In other words,
                    according to the plaintiffs’ evidence, the brand names played no role in
                    distinguishing the 1st Plaintiff’s and 1st Defendant’s
                    products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    No end users from Cameroon gave evidence on
                    this. No survey was carried out on the Cameroon market to find out how the
                    public there perceives the “SINGSUNG” brand name or the SING-SUNG
                    Get-Up. Indeed, aside from the 2nd Plaintiff’s and GEN’s bare
                    assertions, there is no corroborative evidence that the average consumer in
                    Cameroon was unable to identify competing products by their brand
                names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The plaintiffs’ customer, GEN, did
                    give evidence that he had personally been confused on one occasion when he saw
                    what appeared to be a DVD player in a white carton in Douala.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The evidence, however, was hard to follow. It
                    appears that he saw the carton from some distance and on the basis of what is
                    perhaps best described as a glancing encounter. No other details were provided.
                    No corroborative evidence was provided on confusion. As such, I gave little
                    weight to this evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Further, the mere fact that the
                    plaintiffs’ sales may have dropped with the entry of the defendants into
                    the market does not mean that confusion had taken place. Competition, even
                    lawful competition, will naturally have an impact on market share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    On the contrary, TSA for the defendants
                    testified that the brand name was important to customers in
                        Cameroon.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> TSA gave
                    evidence that well-established brands such as “SAMSUNG” and
                    “LG” have entered Cameroon. These brands were said to be more
                    expensive than Singapore brands such as SINGSUNG and LS. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    As such, given the state of the evidence, I
                    ultimately find that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the SINGSUNG
                    Get-Up generated goodwill in Cameroon. I find that there is insufficient
                    evidence to show that the Cameroonian public viewed the SINGSUNG Get-Up as
                    distinctive of the 1st Plaintiff. I also find that there is insufficient
                    evidence to prove that the brand names “SINGSUNG” and
                    “LS” bore little or no significance in the Cameroon market. This
                    is a point to which I shall return to below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    At this juncture, I would like to
                    acknowledge that as in <em>Cadbury-Schweppes</em>, I have
                    little doubt that the 2nd Defendant took advantage of the plaintiffs’
                    efforts in developing the market in Africa for new electrical products that were
                    made in China but sold from Singapore. I also have no doubt that the fury and
                    irritation felt by the 2nd Plaintiff was real when he discovered that his own
                    brother, the 2nd Defendant, had become his competitor and shadow. Moreover, the
                    defendants may well have made use of the 2nd Plaintiff’s effort and labour
                    in selecting what he thought were desirable and saleable electrical and
                    household products by ordering products that were similar or identical to the
                    1st Plaintiff’s products. However, as Walton J said in <em>Harrison and Starkey v Polydor</em> [1977] FSR 1 (albeit a copyright
                    case on moral rights), quoting Lord Evershed MR: fury, even justifiable fury, is
                    not a cause of action. The plaintiffs have not been able to prove what is most
                    critical in this case—that the SINGSUNG Get-Up is part of the
                    goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The following paragraphs ([157]–[219])
                    set out a more detailed assessment of the evidence in respect of each aspect of
                    the SINGSUNG Get-Up, and further explain my ultimate finding that the SINGSUNG
                    Get-Up is not a generator of goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   DVD Players</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The plaintiffs assert goodwill in the
                    packaging of the DVD players, as well as other features of its product
                    design.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In relation to DVD A, I have already briefly
                    described the White Get-Up (at [53(a)] above). The White Get-Up consists of a
                    carton containing the DVD player, which is white in colour. On the carton, there
                    is an image depicting a modern living room and guitars. An image of a DVD player
                    also appears together with a brief description of the main features of the DVD
                    player, which include: “USB Download”; “5.1 Channel DVD
                    Player”; “32 Digital Gaming”; and
                    “Anti-shock”. The brand name “SINGSUNG” is
                    prominently displayed, as is the “SAFETY MARK”. (The
                    “SAFETY MARK” certifies that certain household electrical,
                    electronic and gas products meet the specified safety standards set by
                    Singaporean authorities; these controlled goods require such certification
                    before they can be sold in Singapore: see the SPRING Singapore website at
                    http://www.spring.gov.sg/Building-Trust/Raising-Confidence/Pages/raising-confidence-overview.aspx
                    (last accessed on 28 May 2015)). The 2nd Plaintiff claims he designed the
                    White Get-Up with the help of his in-house graphic designer, CYX.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> DVD A was obtained from a
                    Chinese ODM known as Shenzhen Yinke Technology Development Co Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    I have likewise already briefly described
                    the Blue Get-Up on DVD B (at [53(b)] above). The Blue Get-Up refers to the use
                    of a blue box carton, on which is an image of a DVD player as well as the
                    SINGSUNG brand clearly marked on the carton.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> The evidence established that there was, in
                    fact, a number of models of DVD B sourced by the plaintiffs and on-sold to
                    African importers. During the hearing, the 2nd Plaintiff gave evidence of a
                    number of different models under the DVD B range: DHI, DHII and DHIII. The
                    get-up and size of the cartons for DHII and DHIII were slightly different from
                    DHI, which is the model depicted in the statement of claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The 2nd Plaintiff also gave evidence
                    of his contributions to certain design changes to the packaging (made with the
                    assistance of SEC).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> DVD B was obtained from a Chinese
                    ODM known as Shenzhen Longge Electronics Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Leaving aside the lack of specific,
                    corroborative evidence that members of the public would associate the White
                    Get-Up and the Blue Get-Up exclusively with the 1st Plaintiff for the moment, it
                    seems to me that neither the White Get-Up nor the Blue Get-Up were exceptionally
                    attention-grabbing or memorable. They were fairly typical choices for DVD player
                    packaging. In my view, this makes it far harder (though not impossible) for the
                    plaintiffs to prove that the White Get-Up and the Blue Get-Up acquired a
                    secondary meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Indeed, on this point, I note that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff himself accepted in cross-examination that the packaging of most DVD
                    players would include a photograph or image of the DVD player.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>
                    When asked whether blue was a common colour for the packaging of DVD players,
                    the 2nd Plaintiff’s only response was that no other DVD player packaging
                    came in the <em>shade</em> of blue he chose for his
                    cartons, as well as with the exact design he selected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> I
                    note also that whilst GEN, a witness for the plaintiffs from Cameroon, initially
                    took the position that DVD B was the only DVD player sold in a blue carton at
                    the time when it was introduced, under further cross-examination, it became
                    apparent that there were other DVD players from other retailers marketed in blue
                    cartons although the exact shade of blue and overall design of the said cartons
                    were different.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>
                    Further, the 2nd Plaintiff agreed that the blue colour used for DVD B (in
                    particular, DHI), was different from the blue used on the packaging of the LS
                    DVD player. However, he insisted that the blue was not very
                        different.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    It bears repeating that a prominent feature
                    of the 1st Plaintiff’s DVD player packaging is the
                    “SINGSUNG” brand. In fact, in cross-examination, the 2nd Plaintiff
                    asserted many times that the “SINGSUNG” brand was famous or
                    well-known (of course, he was also quick to add the caveat that consumers in
                    Africa purchased products based on its overall design and appearance, not based
                    on its brand). In my view, the brand name appended on the DVD player packaging
                    is clearly the most obvious and self-evident trade mark. If the 1st Plaintiff is
                    to establish that the get-up (which comprises commonplace features) has acquired
                    a secondary meaning and hence generates goodwill, clearer evidence is
                    needed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Even leaving aside the complete lack of
                    evidence from actual customers, there is no evidence that the 1st Plaintiff
                    spent time and money in promoting the White Get-Up and the Blue Get-Up as an
                    indicator of trade origin, as distinct from promotion of the brand
                    “SINGSUNG”. Whilst the 2nd Plaintiff gave evidence of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s advertising in African countries and elsewhere<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>, the advertisements do not
                    underscore the White Get-Up and Blue Get-Up as indicators of trade origin. The
                    White Get-Up and Blue Get-Up are not actually depicted on the various
                    advertisements exhibited in the 2nd Plaintiff’s affidavit;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> the advertisements mainly contain
                    the “SINGSUNG” brand, and on occasion, pictures of the actual DVD
                    players (rather than their packaging). Indeed, as counsel accepted in the
                        <em>Yakult</em> case, the fact that a design or get-up
                    is memorable (which I am not convinced is even proven in this case) does not
                    mean that it is memorable in the <em>trade mark sense</em>.
                    Whilst this is of course a registered trade mark decision the general point is
                    that a memorable design is not necessarily a generator of goodwill in the tort
                    of passing off. Without evidence that customers view the design or get-up as an
                    indicator of trade origin, or at the very least, evidence that <em>significant</em> advertising and marketing efforts promote
                    the claimed feature as an indicia of trade origin, a court would find it
                    difficult to conclude that the claimed get-up is relevant to the goodwill that
                    is the concern of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The 2nd Plaintiff also gave evidence of the
                    time, effort and care he put in to make certain changes to the design of the DVD
                    players. In particular, he claims to have come up with the idea of the start-up
                    screen, although he accepts that it was a designer from the Chinese manufacturer
                    he placed orders with who actually reduced the idea into visual
                        form.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The 2nd Plaintiff also claimed to have
                    requested the following additions or changes to the DVD players and/or their
                        packaging<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_g"></a>(g)     A warranty card, the terms of which are said to have
                        been penned by the 2nd Plaintiff’s wife with the assistance of an
                        unnamed individual.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Even if I were to accept the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s evidence on the requested additions or changes in its
                    entirety, it is hard to see how this can help the plaintiffs make out a case for
                    goodwill either in respect of each individual addition or change, or in terms of
                    the impact made by the changes and additions as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    I repeat my observation (at [160] above)
                    that many of the features of DVD A and DVD B are ordinary and commonplace on DVD
                    players sold by a variety of retailers. The use of a black and silver colour
                    scheme, and the application of tiny black dots to create a dotted effect on the
                    back panel, appears to be commonplace in the industry. During cross-examination,
                    the 2nd Plaintiff was shown pictures of Samsung and Sony DVD players with a
                    similar number and placement of ports, as well as a similar use of a dotted back
                    panel (in the case of the Sony DVD).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> The response of
                    the 2nd Plaintiff was that the precise positioning of the ports were not the
                    same, and the size of the dots were different.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    It may well be that the precise number and
                    positioning of ports, power cables, and safety marks, <em>etc</em>, will differ between models and brands. However, in my view,
                    this is not a significant distinguishing factor in the eyes of consumers; the
                    number or positioning of ports and cables is unlikely to be something a consumer
                    remembers a DVD player by. If so, this makes it less likely that the changes and
                    additions made by the 2nd Plaintiff will be taken by consumers to be an
                    indicator of trade origin. Adding ports on the back panel or changing the
                    position of a button may improve functionality or appearance. However, it does
                    not follow that the functional or aesthetic changes have become exclusively
                    associated with the plaintiffs in the mind of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    The fact that the 2nd Plaintiff expended
                    time and effort and was proud of his contribution to the customisation of the
                    SINGSUNG DVD players does not go anywhere near establishing goodwill in these
                    features. I do not accept that the differences in the precise positioning,
                    location, number of ports, <em>etc</em>, is something that
                    will be taken by the public as a badge of trade origin. In any case, the
                    plaintiffs’ pleaded case does not include a claim that the various
                    features of the DVD player itself (as opposed to its box packaging) bear
                    goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Based on this evidence, I am unable to
                    conclude that a member of the Cameroonian public would treat the White Get-Up or
                    the Blue Get-Up as exclusively associated with the 1st Plaintiff. Neither the
                    substantial sales achieved by the 1st Plaintiff, especially to overseas trade
                    buyers, nor the fact that the 1st Plaintiff expended effort in choosing the
                    White Get-Up and Blue Get-Up, means that these features have come to be
                    associated exclusively with the 1st Plaintiff as an indicator of trade origin.
                    In coming to this conclusion, I stress again that there is almost no evidence
                    (aside from the assertions of the 2nd Plaintiff and GEN) that customers in
                    Cameroon (or indeed in Singapore or anywhere else) associate the White Get-Up
                    and Blue Get-Up exclusively with the 1st Plaintiff. Whether customers like the
                    look and feel of the product is not the concern of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Warranty cards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The plaintiffs also complained that the
                    defendants had copied the wording of the 1st Plaintiff’s warranty card.
                    This warranty card was found on a number of the 1st Plaintiff’s and 1st
                    Defendant’s products, including the DVD players and the blenders. The
                    evidence was that the 1st Plaintiff and 1st Defendant provided warranty cards
                    largely to buttress the impression in the minds of the consumers that the
                    products were made or sourced from Singapore. It is clear that the end-buyers in
                    Cameroon had no recourse to the 1st Plaintiff or 1st Defendant should they
                    discover that the products were defective. Neither provided repair services in
                    Cameroon. Indeed, I note that the strategy of both parties was to create the
                    appearance that the products were made in Singapore and that they were of the
                    standard and quality associated with Singapore-originated goods. This appears to
                    be the reason why the products were marked as being made in Singapore, and why
                    the Singapore “SAFETY MARK” was also applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    I should state upfront, that the plaintiffs
                    have not asserted goodwill in the warranty cards as such; rather, it claims that
                    the warranty cards constitute evidence of an intention on the part of the
                    defendants to pass off the 1st Defendant’s products or business as
                    connected with the 1st Plaintiff. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will also
                    consider whether the warranty card could possibly be related to the
                    goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The provision of a warranty card can hardly
                    be regarded as unusual or exceptional. The 2nd Plaintiff accepts this—at
                    trial, he conceded that all electrical products are normally sold with a
                    warranty card.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Even if the defendants’
                    products came with an identically worded warranty card, the plaintiffs must
                    demonstrate that members of the public would see the warranty card as
                    exclusively associated with the plaintiffs. Once again, there was no evidence of
                    this. The fact that a warranty card is important does not mean that it is part
                    of or relevant to the goodwill which is the concern of passing off. Much will
                    depend on what the warranty card states.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The position may well be different if 1st
                    Defendant had applied the 1st Plaintiff’s brand (“SINGSUNG”)
                    on its warranty card. If they did, the complaint, properly framed, would be that
                    the 1st Defendant had used the 1st Plaintiff’s brand
                    (“SINGSUNG”) to market and sell its products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    To be clear, there is some evidence that the
                    sample warranty cards provided to the Chinese manufacturers by the 2nd Defendant
                    belonged to the 1st Plaintiff. In cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant was asked
                    to compare the warranty cards for the “SINGSUNG” and
                    “LS” DVD players.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> The
                    warranty cards in evidence contained identical wording. While the 1st
                    Defendant’s warranty card did set out the names “LS Electrical
                    Trading” and “LS Dealer”, it also included the statement
                    that defective products would be repaired by the “SINGSUNG”
                    dealer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The 2nd Defendant’s explanation for
                    this is that the warranty card was provided by the factory. The 2nd Defendant,
                    upon seeing the 1st Plaintiff’s warranty card, accepted it for use on his
                    own products and instructed the factory to replace the “SINGSUNG”
                    name with the “LS” name on the card.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> The mention of
                    “SINGSUNG” in the warranty card was not intended by the
                    defendants, and is there only because of a mistake made by the factory. At this
                    juncture, I must mention that I have doubts about the credibility of this
                    evidence. In cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant accepted that the Chinese ODM
                    which purportedly offered him the “SINGSUNG” warranty cards is New
                    Sun Factory. However, as learned counsel for the plaintiffs point out, the
                    plaintiffs did not manufacture any of their goods at New Sun Factory. The 2nd
                    Defendant did not deny this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> If
                    so, it is difficult to see how the story that the factory was the one who
                    provided the 1st Plaintiff’s warranty card as a sample can be
                true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In the case of warranty cards attached to
                    the mixers and blenders, DL’s evidence was that while the defendants
                    provided a sample warranty card to the Chinese manufacturer, the Chinese
                    manufacturer was also instructed to remove the “SINGSUNG” name and
                    to replace it with the “LS” name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> It is
                    not clear, however, whether this instruction was carried out. I see no reason to
                    doubt this evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    I now make several points in respect of the
                    warranty cards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    First, whilst the plaintiffs claimed to have
                    drafted the wording of the warranty card for the DVD players, the evidence on
                    this is thin. The 2nd Plaintiff’s wife, who allegedly penned the words on
                    the warranty card with some help, did not give evidence. There was also no
                    evidence from the Chinese ODMs on the origins of the warranty
                card.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Second, even accepting that the plaintiffs
                    (or rather, the 2nd Plaintiff’s wife) did draft the warranty cards, the
                    plaintiffs are not asserting any copyright in the warranty card. Instead, the
                    plaintiffs’ claim is that the defendants intentionally copied the
                    plaintiffs’ warranty cards in order to draw a connection between the 1st
                    Plaintiff and 1st Defendant in the mind of end user buyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Given the number and variety of copyright
                    claims made in this action, it is perhaps a little surprising that no assertion
                    was made to literary work copyright over the warranty card. After all, the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s evidence is that his wife (with the assistance of an unnamed
                    third person) was the author of the wording on the warranty card. Of course,
                    none of my remarks should be taken to be deciding whether a claim to copyright
                    in the warranty cards would succeed. The issue is not before me. It is the
                    plaintiffs’ prerogative to decide on the rights it wishes to assert in
                    litigation. Given that it does not assert copyright in the warranty cards, I
                    make no further comment on the warranty card in respect of
                copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Third, I do not think that a warranty card
                        <em>per se</em> (without the brand) in this case is an
                    indicator of trade origin. I note in any case that this was not pleaded by the
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Finally, whilst there is evidence that the
                    defendants provided the 1st Plaintiff’s warranty card as a sample to the
                    Chinese manufacturers, or were aware that the manufacturers were going to use
                    the 1st Plaintiff’s warranty card as a template, I am satisfied (on
                    balance) that the defendants did instruct the manufacturers to remove the
                    “SINGSUNG” name and replace it with references to
                    “LS”. Any trace of “SINGSUNG” on the 1st
                    Defendant’s warranty cards was probably a result of a mistake. The
                    defendants wanted to compete in the same market with the same or similar range
                    of products under their own brand name (no doubt, taking advantage of the
                    plaintiffs’ efforts to develop the Cameroon market). I am not satisfied
                    that the defendants intended to pass off their products as that of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s. In my view, the evidence suggests that the defendants
                    intended to compete hard in their own name. The warranty cards are therefore not
                    evidence of an intention to pass off the 1st Defendant’s goods as the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    For completeness, I note that the plaintiffs
                    have not pleaded or relied on goodwill in the “SINGSUNG” name as
                    such. Therefore, any claim that passing off arises because of the mistaken
                    mention of “SINGSUNG” in the defendants’ warranty cards is
                    not properly before me in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Television Sets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    I turn now to the passing off claim in
                    relation to the television sets. Before moving on, I clarify that the plaintiffs
                    are not asserting that goodwill resides in the <em>packaging</em> of the television sets. Instead, the plaintiffs’
                    main claim is that the sticker on the television set as well as the phrase
                    “Rotary Rotatory” (which is found in the sticker and the front
                    housing of the television set) is what helps generate the
                goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The 1st Plaintiff’s and the 1st
                    Defendant’s television sets are both from the Jinpin Factory in
                        China<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>. The 2nd
                    Plaintiff selected particular television models (all using cathode ray tube
                    technology) from the range offered by the ODM in China. The television models
                    chosen all had screens that were able to swivel 90 degrees on the base
                    plate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    In this regard, I make clear that the
                    plaintiffs do not have any rights over the idea, concept, or technology behind
                    the rotation feature. Even if they were the first to bring such a television set
                    to Singapore, and the first to market such a television set in Cameroon, they do
                    not thereby acquire an exclusive right to sell the product, just as the
                    plaintiff in <em>Cadbury-Schweppes</em> did not have
                    exclusive rights to a lemon squash drink marketed to the theme of heroic
                    masculinity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Of course, to be fair to the plaintiffs,
                    they have never claimed monopoly rights over television sets with the ability to
                    rotate 90 degrees on their base. Rather, they assert goodwill over the sticker
                    (as described above) and the phrase “Rotary Rotatory” which they
                    say they coined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The sticker placed on the screen of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s television set is the crux of the plaintiffs’ passing
                    off claim in relation to the television sets. The sticker bears the phrase
                    “Rotary Rotatory”, as well as three symbols depicting gears,
                    cathode ray tubes, and the side profile of the TV. Together with the symbols,
                    certain information is set out on the sticker: “90 degrees
                    Rotatable”; “100% Brand New Picture Tube with 3 years
                    warranty”; “Terms and Conditions apply”; and “Ultra
                    slim”. The “SINGSUNG” brand appears in yellow lettering at
                    the bottom of the sticker, together with the word
                    “Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The plaintiffs assert that the sticker was
                    conceived and designed by SEC. They also claim that the stickers are important
                    in promoting sales to end user buyers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> This is
                    because the television sets would usually be displayed (without packaging) in
                    shops; as such, the stickers are important in persuading end user customers in
                    Cameroon to purchase the product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    However, the key question is whether the
                    sticker or the phrase “Rotary Rotatory” is, as the plaintiffs
                    assert, an indicator that the television originated from the 1st Plaintiff. In
                    my view, even leaving aside the dispute as to whether the sticker was in fact
                    designed by SEC (or by the Chinese manufacturers), there is little to no
                    independent evidence that consumers refer to the sticker or the phrase
                    “Rotary Rotatory” as an indicator of a particular trade
                    origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    I have no doubt that the sticker conveys
                    some useful information. That said, while there is no direct evidence on this, I
                    am prepared to take judicial notice of the fact that the placement of
                    informational stickers on the screens of television sets that are on display in
                    retail shops is commonplace (at least in Singapore). Also, the information
                    provided on the 1st Plaintiff’s television sticker is quite ordinary. The
                    only unusual aspect of the sticker is the phrase “Rotary Rotatory”
                    which, together with the gear symbols and the words “90 degrees
                    Rotatable”, informs potential customers that the television set can
                    swivel on the base. These phrases and images are descriptive; they describe
                    graphically, and by words, a key attribute of the television set.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    In this regard, I accept that goodwill can
                    arise in commonplace features or descriptive phrases and images. Slogans have
                    been protected before under the tort of passing off. However, as mentioned
                    earlier, if the plaintiffs are to establish that commonplace or descriptive
                    features have acquired a trade mark meaning, there must be evidence that members
                    of the public have come to associate the phrase or feature exclusively with the
                    plaintiffs, as an indicator of trade origin. In the present case, I am unable to
                    conclude that there is sufficient evidence to establish goodwill in the sticker
                    or the phrase “Rotary Rotatory”. The fact that the 1st Plaintiff
                    had sold substantial television sets does not mean that the phrase (being
                    essentially descriptive) must be treated as associated exclusively with the 1st
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    No retail customer gave evidence that he/she
                    treated the sticker and the phrase “Rotary Rotatory” as an
                    indicator of trade origin, or that the sticker and the phrase had become
                    associated exclusively with the 1st Plaintiff. No evidence was provided to show
                    that the sticker and phrase had been promoted in a trade mark sense (that is as
                    a badge of recognition) to customers, and that such advertising had succeeded.
                    Whilst there is evidence that the plaintiffs did spend on advertising their
                    product range, there is little to suggest that the stickers and phrase were
                    underscored as being an indicator of trade origin. No doubt, the sticker did
                    include the “SINGSUNG” brand name. But if that is what renders the
                    sticker an indicator of trade origin, the defendants rightly point out that they
                    used an entirely different brand name on their sticker (<em>ie</em>, “LS”). I should add that in passing off cases,
                    even if it may not be necessary to produce evidence of actual confusion, such
                    evidence can be helpful in cases where the claim to goodwill is marginal and
                    heavily disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Thus, whilst subject to the discussion below
                    on origination, I am prepared to accept that the plaintiffs expended time and
                    effort in conceiving the “Rotary Rotatory” phrase and the
                    particular design of the sticker, I am unable to conclude that plaintiffs have
                    established goodwill in the sticker or in the phrase “Rotary
                    Rotatory”. In my assessment, most customers are likely to regard the
                    sticker as providing useful information, and nothing more. This is fatal to the
                    plaintiffs’ passing off claim in respect of the television
                sets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Rice cookers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    I turn next to the passing off claim in
                    respect of the rice cookers. The body of the 1st Plaintiff’s rice cooker
                    in question is white. On one side, there is a floral pattern design in black and
                    pink. Its operating panel is on the front face of the rice cooker, and the brand
                    “SINGSUNG” appears on the operating panel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    In this case, the plaintiffs assert that
                    goodwill subsists in the floral pattern. It is undoubtedly the case that the
                    pattern is part of the design of the product; but it will be recalled that
                    passing off does not protect product design <em>per
                    se</em>. Under cross-examination, the 2nd Plaintiff accepted that the
                    floral pattern was selected by him out of many patterns that were available in
                    the catalogue of the Chinese ODM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> The 2nd
                    Plaintiff also accepted that the Chinese factory supplied rice cookers to buyers
                    from all over the world.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> It thus seems that the 1st
                    Plaintiff is not the exclusive seller of rice cookers with such a floral design.
                    This substantially reduces the plausibility of the claim that the floral design
                    is associated exclusively with the 1st Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Moreover, the plaintiffs have not been able
                    to provide any positive evidence to establish that its end users regarded the
                    floral pattern as exclusively associated with the 1st Plaintiff. Without such
                    evidence, the plaintiffs’ claim that the floral design is a generator of
                    goodwill, and hence its claim for passing off in respect of the rice cookers,
                    must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Electric kettles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    The plaintiffs assert goodwill in the get-up
                    of five different electrical kettle models. This get-up is described at [53]
                    above as the Domed-Get-up, the Pitcher Plant Get-Up, the White Curved Kettle
                    Get-Up, the Penguin Kettle Get-Up and the Metallic Get-Up. The plaintiffs’
                    brand name appears on the body of the kettles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    All of the designs were designed and
                    purchased from an ODM in China. Once again, the 2nd Plaintiff accepts that the
                    manufacturer sold its products to any buyer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    No claim was made to goodwill in the
                    packaging of the product. Indeed, under cross-examination, the reason for this
                    became clear. Whilst the defendants had selected and sold the same range of
                    kettles, the packaging it used was entirely different.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>
                    Moreover, I note in passing that the 1st Defendant’s “LS”
                    brand was appended on each of its kettles. Of course, this is not of concern to
                    me at this juncture because the issue I am dealing with now simply is whether
                    the plaintiffs have established goodwill in the design of the
                kettles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Whilst the plaintiffs have asserted goodwill
                    over the design of five different kettle models, it will be sufficient for me to
                    explain my decision with reference to just one model. The reasoning I adopt in
                    respect of all five kettle models is substantially the same. I therefore now
                    only describe one kettle model in more detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    The Penguin Kettle Get-Up comprises a white
                    plastic body with a white plastic curved handle, and a blue on-off button near
                    the top of the handle. The base of the kettle is broader than the top. The spout
                    (according to the plaintiffs) has a beak like appearance. At the lower front
                    centre, there is a large purplish-blue translucent window shaped in the form of
                    a large step-pyramid. The window carries markings for the water level. The
                    docking station is round and white in colour. The capacity is 1.7 litres. The
                    brand “SINGSUNG” is clearly visible near the bottom of the kettle
                    (just above where the base sits into the docking station).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Once again, the tenor of the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s evidence is that he spent time selecting the kettle designs
                    (from those available at the Chinese manufacturers). He chose models which he
                    considered to be nice or saleable. I repeat again that I do not doubt that the
                    2nd Plaintiff exercised great care in selecting the kettle models. I can
                    therefore understand why he now complains that the defendants chose similar or
                    almost identical kettle models for their own business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    It may well be (but I make no decision on
                    this) that some aspects of the kettle designs may be protectable in Singapore by
                    means of design registration. However, any such rights are unlikely to belong to
                    the plaintiffs in any case because they are clearly not the designer. And, in
                    any case, that is not relevant to the case before me, and the question I must
                    decide is whether the said get-ups are indicators of trade origin that have
                    become exclusively associated with the 1st Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    I have noted the 2nd Plaintiff’s
                    assertion that the designs of the kettles are distinctive because the plaintiffs
                    have spent money advertising them in Africa.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> But this begs the
                    question, distinctive in what sense? Even if the public recognises the product,
                    and has even come to like or recognise the specific designs, it does not follow
                    that the design is recognised as an <em>indicator of a particular
                        trade origin</em>. Proof of this is required for a passing off claim
                    to succeed. As discussed earlier in this judgment, if the law on passing off did
                    not require proof of such, the consequences would be startling; the tort of
                    passing off would become a convenient, unrestricted avenue for unregistered
                    design protection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    It is stressed that if advertising is the
                    basis for the claim to goodwill, it is necessary to demonstrate that the public
                    has been taught, through the advertising, to recognise the advertised get-up or
                    design elements as indicators of trade origin. For example, in <em>Reckitt</em>, the evidence established that the relevant
                    public regarded natural lemon juice marketed in lemon-shaped containers as an
                    indication the product was made by a particular source. Far more had to be
                    proved above and beyond the fact that the design was recognised and regarded as
                    a likeable design.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    As such, on the evidence before me, I am not
                    able to conclude that goodwill has been established over the Penguin Kettle
                    Get-Up, or indeed, any of the claimed kettle get-ups.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Electric blenders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    In respect of the electric blenders, the
                    plaintiffs assert goodwill in the shape and design of three different electric
                    blenders, each with its own get-up. The get-ups are described at [53] of this
                    judgment as the White and Grey Get-Up, the Black and White Get-Up, and the Black
                    Stainless Steel Get-Up. No claim was made to goodwill in the packaging of the
                    blenders. Again, this is understandable given that the cartons and packaging the
                    1st Defendant used for its blenders were different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    The evidence establishes again that like the
                    other products sold by the 1st Plaintiff, a Chinese ODM manufactured the
                    blenders. The models offered by the Chinese ODM are depicted in a
                    catalogue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    The 2nd Plaintiff asserts that he requested
                    that the colour of the control panel to be changed to grey, and that the dials
                    be coloured black. He also denies that these changes were merely part of the
                    standard colour variants offered by the factory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Even if I were to accept that all of the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s assertions are true, I am still of the view that the colours
                    chosen by the 2nd Plaintiff are unremarkable, especially in the trade mark
                    (passing off) sense. The complaint was that the 2nd Defendant had selected the
                    same blender models and designs, and that this would lead customers to assume
                    that the plaintiffs and defendants were essentially “two brands under one
                    roof”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    However, short of proof that in the eyes of
                    the end users or consumers, the White and Grey Get-Up, the Black and White
                    Get-Up, and the Black Stainless Steel Get-Up have become associated exclusively
                    with the 1st Plaintiff, and are treated as indicators of trade origin, the
                    plaintiffs’ claim for passing off cannot succeed. In this case, such
                    evidence is lacking. While I sympathise with the plaintiffs’ complaint
                    that the defendants are selling the exact same range of products as the
                    plaintiffs, and in fact may very well be deliberately choosing or selecting the
                    same or similar models of products chosen by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs
                    simply have no remedy for this in the law of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(7)   Electric floor fans</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    The plaintiffs’ passing off claim for
                    electric floor fans was made in respect of the fan model, CRSF-18A. The main
                    design feature said to be a repository of goodwill is the round plastic base of
                    the fan, made in the shape of a car steering wheel. No claim was made to
                    goodwill in any aspect of the fan’s packaging.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    I do not think that it is necessary for me
                    to embark on a detailed discussion of the electric floor fans. It suffices for
                    me to state that as with the previous products I discussed, the passing off
                    claim in relation to the electric floor fans must fail because the plaintiffs
                    have not proven that the design of the fan is associated exclusively with the
                    1st Plaintiff, or that it is perceived by consumers to be an indicator of trade
                    origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(8)   Gas stoves</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    The plaintiffs refer to the design of gas
                    stove GS-88, comprising an embossed horse-shoe shaped device bearing the
                    “SINGSUNG” brand, as well as gold coloured burners rimmed by
                    circular chrome support pots. Like the other of the 1st Plaintiff’s
                    products, the gas stove was sourced from a manufacturer in China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Under cross-examination, the 2nd Plaintiff
                    was shown a catalogue from the Chinese factory setting out several gas stove
                    models with similar horse-shoe shaped devices on which a brand could be marked
                    or embossed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The difference is that unlike the
                    1st Plaintiff’s chosen model, the horse-shoe shaped device depicted on the
                    models in the catalogue was inverted. Whilst I accept once again that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff put in time and effort in selecting the model GS-88, I am unable to
                    conclude that the plaintiffs enjoyed goodwill in the claimed get-up simply
                    because there is no evidence that customers viewed the get-up as an indicator of
                    trade origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(9)   Conclusion on goodwill in Cameroon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    In light of the above discussion, I find
                    that the SINGSUNG Get-Up does not assist in generating goodwill in Cameroon. It
                    follows that the claim to passing off based on instruments of deception must
                    fail for there is no goodwill in the claimed indices of origin to which the
                    deception can relate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    To be clear, the finding that there is no
                    goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up in Cameroon is a finding of fact for the purpose
                    of determining passing off in Singapore under Singapore law. It is not a finding
                    of law under the laws of Cameroon. The key finding of fact is that there is
                    insufficient evidence that customers in Cameroon treat the SINGSUNG Get-Up as
                    distinctive of the plaintiffs. Indeed, my earlier finding bears repeating: the
                    get-up is not even associated exclusively with the 1st Plaintiff in the minds of
                    the public in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Misrepresentation in Cameroon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Given my finding that there is no goodwill
                    in the SINGSUNG Get-Up in Cameroon, it is not strictly necessary for me to
                    consider if there is misrepresentation or a likelihood of confusion in Cameroon.
                    Nevertheless, it is appropriate to deal with one of the submissions made by the
                    plaintiffs in support of their position that there was indeed misrepresentation
                    to, and confusion among, the consumers in Cameroon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    The plaintiffs submit that consumers in
                    Cameroon are not literate in English and thus do not rely on the brand names
                    “SINGSUNG” and “LS”. This means that the different
                    brand names appended prominently on the 1st Plaintiff’s and 1st
                    Defendant’s products/packaging do not reduce the likelihood of
                    confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    The plaintiffs relied on <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm
                        Corp</em>) [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1082 at [9] for the proposition that as a
                    general rule, it is assumed that non-English speaking audiences would pay little
                    attention to verbal or textual, as opposed to visual, similarity. The court made
                    this comment in the context of trade mark registration opposition
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In this judgment, I do not have to decide
                    whether a general rule to that effect in registered trade mark law is also part
                    of the law of passing off in Singapore. However, even if it is, I am of the view
                    that the assumption made by the rule cannot possibly be applicable in <em>every</em> case. Whether it does apply must depend on the
                    facts and circumstances of each case, including the nature of the verbal and
                    textual indicia as compared to the asserted visual indicia of origin. In this
                    regard, there is a big difference between simple textual brand names such as
                    “SONY”, “SAMSUNG”, “ROLEX” or indeed,
                    “SINGSUNG”, and lengthier textual indicia such as a slogan. In
                    this day and age of consumerism, the flat world, and international trade and
                    marketing, it cannot be assumed that non-English speaking members of society in
                    Singapore (or elsewhere) place no or little significance on simple textual brand
                    names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The plaintiffs also relied on the English
                    decision of Lightman J in <em>Modus Vivendi</em>. This
                    case, it will be recalled, concerned a passing off action relating to the
                    plaintiff’s cans of cigarette lighter refill fuel. The plaintiff’s
                    cans were marketed in a particular get-up, and were exported from Scotland to
                    China. Significant features of the plaintiff’s get-up included: (a) the
                    bright yellow background; (b) the red cap; (c) the red swirling flame; (d) black
                    and red writing on the can; (e) a rectangle with writing below the flame; and
                    (f) the name “RONSON” written in yellow against the middle of the
                    flame. The defendant used a similar get-up on its cans, but used its own trade
                    mark. The defendant’s trade mark was wholly different from the
                    plaintiff’s trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    A significant reason that the
                    plaintiff’s claim succeeded is that the public in China relied upon the
                    get-up on the cans, rather than the trade mark written in western script,
                    bearing in mind that the majority of the Chinese population could not read
                    English. This is not surprising given that Chinese script, being based on
                    characters, is entirely different from language based on the alphabet. That
                    said, the court’s finding of actionable misrepresentation did come on the
                    back of its holding that by 1989, the plaintiff had already developed <em>substantial goodwill in the get-up of the cans in China</em>.
                    Its sales in China were substantial, and there was already fairly heavy
                    advertising of the product and in particular, its get-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    It is clear that the <em>Modus Vivendi</em> decision was reached on its own facts. The
                    decision was not based solely on the finding that Chinese consumers do not (or
                    cannot) rely on the brand names on the cans. It was crucial that the get-up
                    which was copied was heavily advertised and was found to generate goodwill.
                    Therefore, while the decision is good authority for the proposition that get-up
                        <em>can</em> be a generator of goodwill, it is not
                    authority for the proposition that get-up <em>is
                        always</em> a generator of goodwill when consumers cannot read the
                    English brand name or trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    I note that in <em>Modus
                        Vivendi</em> the English High Court after stating the proposition of
                    law that the plaintiff must establish a goodwill/reputation attached to the
                    goods in the mind of the relevant purchasing public by association with the
                    identifying get-up such that the get-up is recognised by the relevant sector of
                    the public as distinctive of the plaintiff, focused its discussion on goodwill
                    in China (not UK). The court found that substantial goodwill subsisted in the
                    get-up in China. An actionable misrepresentation was found because the defendant
                    had adopted a similar get-up with the result that the consumer in China would
                    assume they were Ronson products. It is to be noted that the court did not
                    expressly decide whether the goodwill in UK also extended to the get-up
                    (although it did recognise that the Ronson brand enjoyed goodwill for butane gas
                    cans in UK). Nevertheless, even if <em>Modus Vivendi</em>
                    is correct in concentrating on the market in China (as to which see above at
                    [143]–[144]) the case does not assist the Plaintiffs on the facts before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    In the present case, I am not satisfied that
                    members of the public had been taught (through advertising or otherwise) to
                    recognise any part of the SINGSUNG Get-Up as indicia of origin. Indeed, it bears
                    repeating that the defendants’ trade buyer from Cameroon stated that
                    Cameroonian consumers recognised famous brands such as
                    “SAMSUNG”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    I note also the plaintiffs’ submission
                    that there are decisions from South Africa, Uganda and Kenya that have noted the
                    problem of illiteracy. However, be that as it may, the fact remains that there
                    is no evidence before me (aside from the assertion of GEN) on the scale and
                    depth of English illiteracy in Cameroon. The fact that the population may not be
                    fluent in English does not mean they cannot or do not take cognisance of simple
                    textual brand names. Far more evidence of the market in Cameroon, the customers,
                    and their perception of the products is needed for a court to reach that
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Finally, I note also that the two traders
                    from Cameroon who gave evidence (GEN and TSA) testified in French. These two
                    traders have some basic understanding of English. Whilst there is no evidence
                    before me whether the average consumer in Cameroon is familiar with Swahili and
                    French, I take judicial notice of the fact that the French alphabet is largely
                    the same as the English alphabet. The only point that I make is that if the
                    plaintiffs are to make good the assertion that the average customer in Cameroon
                    is unable to or will find it difficult to identify products by reference to
                    English brand names, clearer evidence is necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    In stating this, I accept that it is not
                    necessary to prove <em>actual confusion</em> in the market
                    place to succeed in a passing off action. Nevertheless, there must be sufficient
                    evidence or a sufficient basis for the court to come to the conclusion that the
                    misrepresentation (assuming this is established) is <em>likely</em> to cause confusion. Ordinarily, this means confusion in
                    the sense that the goods being supplied by the defendant are thought to
                    originate from the plaintiff. However, passing off can also arise where members
                    of the public are deceived (or likely to be deceived) into thinking that there
                    is a <em>trade or commercial connection</em> between the
                    defendant’s goods and the plaintiff’s goods. Whilst the precise
                    limits of the latter form of passing off has yet to be fully developed by the
                    courts in Singapore, the general principle has been accepted. Even so, on the
                    evidence, I am not satisfied that there is a sufficient likelihood that the
                    customers will draw such a connection. I thus make no further comments on the
                    legal principles applicable to passing off and trade association or
                    connection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other ways of proving goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    My finding that the SINGSUNG Get-Up does not
                    enjoy or generate goodwill in Singapore and in Cameroon is based largely on the
                    lack of evidence that the relevant public views the said get-up as an indicator
                    of the 1st Plaintiff’s trade origin. I find it necessary to deal with two
                    other submissions made by the plaintiffs in support of their claim to goodwill.
                    These arguments were not based on there being direct evidence showing that the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up was viewed as an indicator of trade origin. Instead, the
                    plaintiffs argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_232-p2_a"></a>(a)     evidence of deliberate copying and
                        an intention to deceive proves goodwill in that which is copied;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_232-p2_b"></a>(b)     the use of the
                        plaintiffs’ marketing materials proves goodwill in that which is
                        replicated in the marketing materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevance of the intention to deceive in determining
                goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    While I have found that the <em>evidence</em> does not bear out the proposition that the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up bears goodwill in either Singapore or Cameroon, the plaintiffs
                    have nevertheless suggested in their submissions that the inadequate evidence of
                    goodwill may not be fatal <em>if</em> they can prove that
                    the defendants deliberately copied the SINGSUNG Get-Up, and intended to deceive
                    consumers by so copying.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Was there an intention to deceive?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    The threshold question is obviously a
                    factual one—was there even deliberately copying and/or an intention to
                    deceive on the part of the defendants?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    “Copying” that takes the form
                    of a decision to compete in exactly the same market with the same goods is not,
                    on its own, evidence of an intention to pass off or deceive. The latter involves
                    an intention to represent to consumers that one’s goods are associated
                    with, or come from, another trader. Two shops selling “SAMSUNG”
                    television sets may well display and sell identical models. This does not mean
                    that the second shop intends to pass off its business as that of the first
                    shop’s or vice versa.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    In the present case, what has been shown is
                    that the defendants decided to enter the same market and to acquire the same
                    range of products for sale. Both the plaintiffs and the defendants purchased
                    their products from ODMs in China, and sold and marketed the products under
                    their respective brands. There is evidence that the 2nd Plaintiff put in effort
                    to choose and customise some of the products he purchased from the Chinese
                    manufacturers, and that the defendants followed suit and purchased the same
                    customised products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    The 2nd Defendant denies that his intention
                    was to deceive or pass off his goods or business as being connected with the
                    plaintiffs. The plaintiffs submit that this must be false given evidence that
                    the defendants chose and ordered products that were similar or identical to
                    those of the plaintiffs in terms of features, colour, and general
                    appearance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    Having considered the evidence, I find that
                    the defendants did not intend to deceive customers or pass off their goods as
                    being those of the plaintiffs, notwithstanding the conscious decision to choose
                    the same range of products and models. The evidence suggests that the defendants
                    have never represented to potential customers that they are the manufacturer or
                    distributor of the plaintiffs’ goods, or are otherwise associated with the
                    plaintiffs. The evidence also suggests that this is a case where the defendants
                    intended to compete directly against the plaintiffs in the same market and with
                    the same range of products. Even if they had deliberately chosen similar
                    products or packaging, the fact remains that the 1st Defendant’s packaging
                    (unlike the defendant’s packaging in <em>Telmak
                        Teleproducts (Australia) Pty Ltd v Coles Myer Limited</em> [1989] FCA
                    272 (“<em>Telmak</em>”) (see below at
                    [243]–[254])) always prominently displayed its own “LS”
                    brand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    With this finding, it is unnecessary for me
                    to further explore the law on whether evidence of a defendant’s intention
                    to deceive may lead or contribute to a finding of goodwill in the
                    plaintiff’s claimed get-up. Nevertheless, in case I am wrong on my factual
                    conclusion that there is no intention to deceive, I shall proceed to consider if
                    an intention to deceive is relevant in showing that the get-up generates
                    goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Law on an intention to deceive in relation to
                goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    The legal question before me is this: if a
                    plaintiff fails to adduce direct evidence that goodwill subsists in its claimed
                    get-up or mark, can evidence that a defendant copied the said get-up or mark
                    with the intention to deceive consumers into believing that its products are in
                    some way associated with the plaintiff, lead or contribute to a finding of
                    goodwill? In other words, is proving an intention to deceive on the part of the
                    defendant another way of proving goodwill where direct evidence of goodwill has
                    proven lacking?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    This question arises from the
                    plaintiffs’ submissions. There was some suggestion from the
                    plaintiffs’ submissions that deliberate copying and an intention to
                    deceive on the part of the defendants is evidence that that which is
                    deliberately copied (<em>ie</em>, the SINGSUNG Get-Up) has
                    goodwill. I note this point was made in their closing submissions under the
                    heading of both “Goodwill”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> and
                        “Misrepresentation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    The key authorities relied on are the
                    Federal Court of Australia’s decision in <em>Telmak</em>, as well as a passage in <em>Wadlow on
                        Passing Off</em> at para 8-003. Given the plaintiffs’
                    substantial reliance on <em>Telmak</em>, I shall now set
                    out and discuss the decision in some detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    In <em>Telmak</em>, the
                    plaintiff marketed a type of frying pan described as a “dry-fry”
                    pan. The frying pan was designed in a manner to minimise the amount of oil
                    required. The frying pan was sold in boxes which prominently set out the words
                    “dry-fry convection oven pan with lid” in a particular lettering.
                    The brand “Telmak” was also set out on the boxes. The plaintiff
                    ran a substantial advertising campaign to promote the product. Sometime after
                    the plaintiff started selling its “dry-fry” pans, the defendant
                    also started to sell dry-fry pans. The defendant’s pans were imported from
                    Taiwan. The parties’ pans were similar in size and shape, but the
                    defendant’s pans were of a different colour. The defendant’s pans
                    were cheaper and marketed in boxes of a similar size to that of the
                    plaintiff’s. The same words that appeared on the plaintiff’s boxes
                    also appeared on the defendant’s boxes. No brand appeared on the
                    defendant’s box packaging at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    The plaintiff’s passing off claim was
                    based on the similarity in the parties’ packaging. In particular, the
                    plaintiff claimed that the words “dry-fry convection oven pan with
                    lid” had become distinctive of Telmak.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    At first instance, Gummow J (as he then was)
                    found that the words were not distinctive. On appeal, the plaintiff submitted
                    that goodwill resided not in the words <em>per se</em>, but
                    in the size, the style, and the precise order in which the words were set out on
                    the packaging of a substantially similar product. The plaintiff asserted that
                    during the two years of marketing, this aspect of the get-up had become
                    distinctive of its product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    Crucially, the plaintiff in <em>Telmak</em> had also suggested in its submissions that the
                    defendant had, on its own packaging, <em>deliberately
                        copied</em> the words “dry-fry convection oven pan with
                    lid”, as well as the particular way it appeared on the plaintiff’s
                    packaging. According to the plaintiff, evidence of deliberately copying by a
                    defendant strongly compelled the conclusion that the get-up copied possessed
                    goodwill. Its submission (as reproduced at [36] of the dissenting judgment) was
                    that when an experienced retailer knowingly marks a product with a name and the
                    get-up of a name which is exactly identical with the name and get-up of the
                    market leader, the only inference was that it was doing so because it perceived
                    some advantage, namely, that consumers would associate its products with that of
                    the market leader. As the majority summarised (at [20] of the majority
                    judgment), the plaintiff also submitted that it was unnecessary for it
                    “to show the existence of a distinctive association” if it proves
                    that the defendant intended to deceive members of the public into believing that
                    its pan was Telmak’s. Thus, according to the plaintiff in <em>Telmak</em>, by deliberately using a similar get-up, the
                    defendant was liable for passing off. If this argument is correct, the
                    plaintiffs in the present case may have a case for goodwill existing in the
                    SINGSUNG Get-Up on the basis that the defendants deliberately copied significant
                    portions of the said get-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    The appeal was allowed on a split decision.
                    I first explain the dissenting judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    The dissenting judge accepted (at [12] of
                    his dissenting judgment) that in some cases, goodwill may be established in
                    ordinary descriptive words and phrases. However, he added that these cases are
                    unlikely to be numerous. On the facts, the dissenting judge was not persuaded
                    that the words “got-up in the way which has been described are
                    sufficiently distinctive of the Telmak product to warrant a finding that Telmak
                    has goodwill or reputation in them ...” (see [15] of the dissenting
                    judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    Most important, for our present purposes,
                    are the comments made by the dissenting judge on the legal implications of a
                    factual finding that the defendant deliberately copied the plaintiff’s
                    get-up to deceive consumers. The dissenting judge held (at [43] of the
                    dissenting judgment) that the finding of a deliberate intention to deceive was
                    only relevant to the question “whether the applicant for relief has
                    established a misrepresentation”; it “will not assist an applicant
                    to establish goodwill or reputation”. The dissenting judge went on to
                    remark that “[i]f its evidence does not establish reputation, no amount
                    of dishonesty on the part of a respondent will take the applicant’s case
                    over the line”. In other words, the learned dissenting judge was of the
                    view that deliberate copying or an intention to deceive was <em>irrelevant</em> to establishing goodwill. Proving goodwill through
                    direct evidence is a burden the plaintiff (or applicant for relief) has to bear.
                    Only after crossing this hurdle will evidence that the defendant intended to
                    deceive be relevant to show that there was misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    The majority, however, allowed the appeal.
                    The majority accepted (at [21]) that there was no evidence that either members
                    of the public or people in the trade distinctively associated the words
                    “dry-fry convection oven pan with lid” with Telmak; it held that
                    the defendant was entitled to use the said descriptive words (at
                [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    The majority also accepted (at [22] of the
                    majority judgment) the principle that proof of deliberate copying does not
                    necessarily establish a case of passing off. Deliberate copying, the majority
                    stated, whilst of “powerful evidentiary value”, still requires an
                    assessment of the whole of the evidence as to whether the plaintiff has
                    established a misrepresentation. Nevertheless, the majority went on to find
                    passing off on the basis of goodwill in the <em>visual
                        lay-out</em> of the words on the packaging. The get-up, according to
                    the majority at [25], comprised the particular lay-out of the words in a form
                    created by or on behalf of the plaintiff, and applied to the promotion of its
                    product. Given the volume of sales of the product in that packaging, and the
                    “extensive advertising of those pans in those boxes”, it was
                    reasonable to treat that lay-out as part of the Telmak product’s goodwill.
                    It is not the words that are protected, but the use of the words in that
                    particular lay-out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Having decided the issue of goodwill, the
                    majority turned to the issue of misrepresentation and likelihood of deception.
                    It held that the question was one of fact. The similarities in get-up relied on
                    were: (a) the size and shape of the boxes; (b) the words used by way of
                    description; and (c) the size and layout of the lettering conveying the
                    description (see <em>Telmak</em> at 68). The first
                    similarity was dismissed as being explainable by the defendant’s desire to
                    have an appropriately sized package for the efficient packaging of its product.
                    The second similarity was not relevant because the words were not distinctive of
                    the plaintiff. The third similarity, however, was relevant. The majority had
                    already found that there was goodwill in the specific lay-out of the words and
                    lettering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    The majority stated that the question of
                    misrepresentation was, on the facts, finely balanced. On the one hand, the court
                    took into account the similar sized package, the identical lettering, and the
                    evidence of deliberate copying; against that, was the presence of substantial
                    dissimilarities in the get-up as a whole, such as the pictures used and the
                    remainder of the wording. In such a finely balanced case, what tilted the case
                    in favour of liability for the majority was both the defendant’s
                    deliberate choice to copy the description and the lay-out of the description,
                    but also the defendant’s continued insistence that it had the right to
                    continue to use the words in that particular style of lettering. The
                    majority’s disapproval of the defendant’s conduct was evident.
                    Indeed, I note that at the start of the majority judgment, the observation was
                    made that whatever the result, the facts did not reflect well on the
                    defendant’s conduct. The end result was that the plaintiff was granted an
                    injunction restraining the defendant from using the words “dry-fry
                    convection oven pan with lid” in lettering substantially similar to the
                    lettering for those words used by plaintiff on any of its products or
                    packaging.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    Ultimately, <em>Telmak</em> turned on a close analysis of the overall facts. The
                    majority accepted that, leaving aside the conduct of the defendant, the case on
                    misrepresentation was finely balanced. The first instance judge and the
                    dissenting judge on appeal found against the plaintiff on the basis that
                    whatever the conduct of the defendant, goodwill had not been established. The
                    majority on appeal disagreed. In finding goodwill in the specific lettering and
                    style of the words “dry-fry convection oven pan with lid” used by
                    the plaintiff, the majority relied on the volume of sales and extensive
                    advertising of the product in the packaging with the claimed get-up. For this
                    reason, the majority found that it was reasonable to treat that lay-out as part
                    of the Telmak product’s goodwill. The finding of goodwill was the plank on
                    which the majority then proceeded to consider the second element of passing off:
                    misrepresentation and the likelihood of deception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    A number of points arise from <em>Telmak</em>. Passing off is not founded on confusion or
                    deception alone. It stands on the bedrock of a property right over goodwill and
                    the badges of origin which have generated the goodwill. It is only if goodwill
                    is established that the question of misrepresentation and likelihood of
                    confusion arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    On goodwill, <em>Telmak</em> establishes that words which are <em>prima
                        facie</em> descriptive (and hence not distinctive) can, through
                    exclusive use, promotion and advertising, acquire a secondary meaning or
                    exclusive association with the plaintiff. This was so in <em>Reddaway</em>, as mentioned earlier. Importantly, <em>Telmak</em> does not support any proposition that deliberate copying
                    or an intention to deceive, always contributes or assists in a <em>finding of goodwill</em>. The minority judgment expressly
                    denied this, while the majority was equivocal on this point, and was only
                    willing to state that deliberate copying assists at the
                    “misrepresentation” stage of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    At this juncture, I point out that the
                    distinction between the elements of goodwill and misrepresentation in the tort
                    of passing off must be kept in view. Whilst an intention to pass off by copying
                    the features in dispute is relevant to assessing the likelihood of confusion, it
                    will be rare that proof of such an intention is sufficient on its own to
                    establish goodwill. Indeed, the distinction between deliberate copying and an
                    intention to pass off must also be borne in mind. Deliberately copying (in the
                    sense of a decision to compete in the same market or market segment with the
                    same range of goods), as in the present case, may take place for reasons that
                    are unrelated to an intention to pass off. The defendant may have deliberately
                    decided to compete in the same market as the plaintiff after the plaintiff
                    developed the market or showed that the market exists and is profitable. This
                    however does not mean that the defendant intended to pass off its products as
                    being the plaintiff’s. Specific evidence of the latter (beyond deliberate
                    copying in the sense that is referred to above) is necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    Indeed, I note that whatever view is taken
                    of the <em>Telmak</em> decision, it is clear that the key
                    finding of fact that led to goodwill in that case was the extensive advertising
                    of the product in the packaging bearing the get-up (lay-out) in question. In the
                    present case the evidence as to advertising is not such as to enable me to draw
                    any conclusion as to whether the get-up (especially of the packaging) formed a
                    significant component of the advertisements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Use of the plaintiffs’ marketing materials</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    The plaintiffs have also argued that the
                    defendants’ reliance on the 1st Plaintiff’s marketing materials
                    demonstrates goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up. While this argument was not
                    expressly made, for the sake of completeness, I shall assume that the plaintiffs
                    intended this to be another alternative way of demonstrating goodwill (besides
                    offering direct evidence that consumers actually viewed the SINGSUNG Get-Up as
                    an indicator of the 1st Plaintiff’s trade origin). I shall now consider if
                    this is so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    The key case cited by the plaintiffs in
                    relation to this point is <em>Momentum Creations Pte Ltd v Tan
                        Eng Koon (trading as De Angeli)</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 342
                        (“<em>Momentum Creations</em>”).
                    According to the plaintiffs, the case stands for the proposition that a
                    defendant who relies on the plaintiff’s sales material in its own
                    marketing demonstrates that the plaintiff enjoys goodwill in the products or
                    get-up contained in the sales material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    
          <em>Momentum
                        Creations</em> concerned furniture sold by the plaintiff under the
                    “OM” trade mark. Evidence was tendered showing that the
                    defendant’s sales representatives had made representations to customers
                    that the defendant was the distributor of “OM” products. The sales
                    representatives had shown “OM” advertisements and brochures to
                    potential customers. Four items of furniture sold by the defendant were similar
                    to “OM” products. The defendant was essentially representing that
                    he was the maker or supplier of “OM” furniture when selling the
                    four items in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    Passing off in this case succeeded because
                    of the use of the “OM” mark in promoting the defendant’s
                    goods. I must clarify that this is not a case where the court found that the
                        <em>design of the four items</em> enjoyed goodwill.
                    Instead, the goodwill that was interfered with was the goodwill which subsisted
                    in the “OM” trade mark. The defendant used the plaintiff’s
                    advertisements and brochures in order to ride on the goodwill in the
                    “OM” trade mark. The passing off was in substance a form of
                    inverse passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    In the present case, whilst there is some
                    evidence that the defendants had based its brochure and warranty card on the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s brochure and warranty card, I am unable to conclude that the
                    defendants had thereby represented that they were dealers in the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s products or were the makers of the 1st Plaintiff’s
                    products such as to ride on the goodwill in the “SINGSUNG” name.
                    The evidence as to how the catalogue was used and whether the warranty card
                    (with the erroneous “SINGSUNG” reference) was actually used or
                    corrected is thin. <em>Momentum Creation</em> can easily be
                    distinguished on the ground that in the present case, the defendants did not
                    represent itself to be the 1st Plaintiff in its brochures. While the defendant
                    in <em>Momentum Creations</em> used the plaintiff’s
                    “OM” brochures, the defendants in this case manufactured their own
                    brochures with their own “LS” brand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    Moreover, while this is a technical point, I
                    must mention that the plaintiffs have not pleaded a claim to passing off based
                    on the “SINGSUNG” mark. There is no claim to goodwill in the
                    “SINGSUNG” name before me. The claim before me is based on
                    goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    Thus, to conclude this section, I do not
                    find that the slim evidence of the defendants’ use of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s brochures or warranty card warrants a finding that there is
                    goodwill in the SINGSUNG Get-Up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of my findings on passing off </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    The claim for passing off is based on the
                    alleged similarities in the get-up, design and other features of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s and 1st Defendant’s competing products. It is not based
                    on the parties’ brand names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    In relation to the straightforward claim for
                    passing off in Singapore, I find first that Singapore consumers/customers do not
                    view the SINGSUNG Get-Up as an indicator of the 1st Plaintiff’s trade
                    origin. In particular, the following reasons were crucial to my finding:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_a"></a>(a)     The existence of actual sales to
                        Singapore consumers is thin, and at best, small in
                    volume.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was
                        no evidence on how Singapore consumers viewed the SINGSUNG
                    Get-Up.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        evidence suggests that the trade buyers were very aware that the 1st
                        Plaintiff and 1st Defendant ran separate businesses that sold similar
                        products. They are therefore unlikely to have treated the SINGSUNG Get-Up as
                        indicators of trade origin. Further, the plaintiffs adduced no evidence that
                        the trade buyers treated the SINGSUNG Get-Up as indicators of trade origin,
                        or that they were confused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    Moreover, I find that even if goodwill did
                    exist in Singapore, the brand names “SINGSUNG” and
                    “LS” are likely to have negated any possibility of
                    confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    In relation to the passing off claim based
                    on the instruments of deception doctrine, I find that while the 1st Defendant
                    clearly did put into circulation the alleged instruments of deception, there was
                    no passing off. My conclusion is mainly based on the following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_a"></a>(a)     The 1st Defendant’s goods
                        that were supplied in Singapore were not instruments of deception in
                        Singapore as there was no evidence that the public in Singapore regarded the
                        SINGSUNG Get-Up (as distinct from the actual brand names) as a badge of
                        origin distinctive of the 1st Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_b"></a>(b)     The SINGSUNG Get-Up does not enjoy goodwill in
                        Cameroon. My finding is premised primarily on the fact that there was simply
                        insufficient evidence that the consumers in Cameroon viewed the SINGSUNG
                        Get-Up as an indicator of trade origin (exclusively associated with the 1st
                        Plaintiff).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, it is not unlikely that the brand names “SINGSUNG”
                        and “LS” may still serve to distinguish the plaintiffs’
                        and defendants’ goods. It is not a general rule that brand names in
                        the English lettering will not be relied upon by consumers who are English
                        illiterate. Much depends on the complexity of the English word or phrase and
                        the overall circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    I also reject the plaintiffs’
                    submissions that goodwill exists by virtue of the defendants’ alleged
                    deliberate copying, deception, or use of the 1st Plaintiff’s marketing
                    materials. In my view, the lack of proper evidence of goodwill is fatal to the
                    plaintiffs’ claim for passing off.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    In the paragraphs that follow, I shall
                    consider if the plaintiffs own copyright in any of the above works, and if so,
                    whether the defendants have infringed the plaintiffs’
                copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The White Get-Up</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    The plaintiffs’ claim to own copyright
                    in the White Get-Up rests on the assertion that the 2nd Plaintiff designed the
                    said get-up. I start by discussing the facts relating to the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s role in the design of the White Get-Up. I then discuss the law
                    on the ownership of copyright, and finally consider if the 2nd Plaintiff (or the
                    plaintiffs together) can be said to be owner(s) or exclusive licensees of the
                    copyright in the White Get-Up. Most of the relevant law will be discussed in
                    detail under this section. The principles distilled will then be applied to the
                    other claimed original artistic works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence on the White Get-Up</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    The 2nd Plaintiff testified that he designed
                    the White Get-Up together with “workers” from the Chinese ODM
                    sometime in early 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> The witness clarified that what
                    he did was to describe the general idea to a designer from the Chinese ODM. In
                    short, according to the 2nd Plaintiff, the ideas behind the design belonged to
                    him, but the actual picture in terms of the expression of the artistic elements,
                    was developed and reduced to material form by the manufacturer’s designer
                    on the 2nd Plaintiff’s instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> I note that no witness from the Chinese
                    manufacturer gave evidence on the origination of the picture, but the defendants
                    did not offer evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_275"></a>275    What is not clear from the evidence of the
                    2nd Plaintiff, however, is the extent to which he provided detailed feedback on
                    the artistic elements of the White Get-Up (such as perspective, details,
                    arrangement and visual impact). CYX, the 1st Plaintiff’s quality control
                    manager, testified on behalf of the plaintiffs. Her evidence was that during
                    their visit to the Chinese manufacturer, the 2nd Plaintiff informed the
                    ODM’s designer that it was important to have a design that was evocative
                    of a consumer lifestyle and that showcased the fact that DVD players were modern
                    conveniences to be enjoyed in the comfort of home. Following that request, the
                    designer created a draft sketch to which the 2nd Plaintiff requested minor
                        amendments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    On the whole, I accept the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s evidence that he did come up with the idea behind the White
                    Get-Up, and had also provided feedback on the images. I am also satisfied that
                    the Chinese ODM’s designer was responsible for executing the idea and
                    producing the actual picture. I find no reason to doubt CYX’s evidence on
                    the extent of the 2nd Plaintiff’s involvement in the design of the White
                    Get-Up either.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ownership of copyright in the White Get-Up </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    Section 30(2) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63,
                    Rev Ed 2006) (“the CA”) states that “the author of a
                    literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work shall be entitled to any copyright
                    subsisting in the work”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    The CA does not set out a general definition
                    of authorship. However, it is clear that copyright is concerned with protecting
                    original expression of ideas, and not ideas themselves. A clever original idea
                    does not attract copyright on its own; what does attract copyright is the
                    original <em>expression</em> of the idea. This distinction
                    between the idea and its expression is well-established and much discussed in
                    copyright law. Indeed, this distinction permeates much of copyright law: from
                    authorship, originality, the meaning of expression and subsistence of copyright,
                    all the way to infringement and remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    One issue that frequently arises is whether
                    a claim to authorship can be made out based on contributions to the idea upon
                    which the work is built. Take for example the well-known decision <em>Kenrick &amp; Co v Lawrence &amp; Co.</em> [1890] 25 QB 99
                        (“<em>Kenrick</em>”). In that case, X
                    came up with the idea of having a “user friendly” voting card; it
                    consisted of using a simple line drawing of a hand marking a cross within a box
                    so as to help illiterate voters understand how their vote was to be recorded. X
                    could not draw and asked an employee to execute the idea and produce the voting
                    card coupon. X also gave directions for some changes to be made to the position
                    of the hand in the first draft. The court eventually found that copyright did
                    subsist in the drawings (notwithstanding the simplicity of the work), but
                    commented (in passing) that X could not claim to be the sole author of the
                    drawing. His contributions to the artistic expression were limited to the
                    suggestions he made. At most, X might have enjoyed a claim to be a joint author
                    with the employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    Usually, where a court is faced with facts
                    such as those in <em>Kenrick</em>, it does not matter
                    whether X is the sole or joint author of the design, or if he even is an author
                    at all. This is because the drawing is executed by an employee in the course of
                    his employment, and hence, s 30(6) of the CA confers the copyright ownership on
                    the employer. The point remains, however, that just because a person has
                    conceived what he considers to be a clever and useful idea does not mean he
                    becomes the author of the artwork in which those ideas are expressed. This is so
                    even if he has made some suggestions and voiced some criticism on drafts.
                    Authorship depends on the <em>nature and extent of contribution
                        that person makes to the actual expression reduced to material
                        form</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a>281    There are many cases in which courts have
                    found that the person who contributed to the idea behind the work was not the
                    author of the eventual work as expressed in material form, for example:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_281-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>Tate v
                            Fullbrook</em> [1908] 1 KB 821, P conceived of the general idea
                        for a comic play. The idea and the dramatic situations were communicated to
                        a script writer who then composed the dialogue in accordance with P’s
                        ideas. The Court of Appeal was unanimous in finding that P was not the
                        author of the work. In this regard, Vaughan Williams LJ stated at 826 that
                        whilst it was true that the plaintiff had suggested the general idea, that
                        did not “make the plaintiff the author of the sketch either alone or
                        jointly with [the script writer]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_281-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>Wiseman v George
                            Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Ltd and Donaldson</em> [1985] FSR 525
                        and <em>Donoghue v Allied Newspapers Limited</em>
                        [1938] Ch 106, the English courts found that the litigant in question did
                        not become an author or even a joint author of a work under copyright law
                        despite his contribution to the idea behind the work and his participation
                        in discussions and offering feedback.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a>282    On the other hand, one case in which a
                    person succeeded in establishing a claim to joint authorship is <em>Najma Heptulla v Orient Longman Limited</em> [1989] 1 FSR 598
                        (“<em>Heptulla</em>”). That was an
                    interlocutory decision of the Indian High Court in New Delhi. An individual was
                    persuaded to write an “autobiography” on the basis that a certain
                    professor would undertake as much of the writing as possible. It took two years
                    to write the book. In those two years, the individual would describe his
                    experiences to the professor, who would take down detailed notes. Draft chapters
                    were prepared and discussed at length with the individual. It was accepted (at
                    least for interlocutory purposes) that the individual concerned requested
                    numerous amendments and alterations. After the first draft of the book, the
                    individual required some 30 pages of “a personal character” to be
                    deleted. The individual was also involved in vetting subsequent drafts. The
                    court found that the individual and the professor were joint authors and hence,
                    joint owners of copyright in the autobiography.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    Indeed, I note that the concept of joint
                    authorship (and hence ownership) is well-established. In <em>Levy
                        v Rutley</em> (1870-71) LR 6 CP 523 (“<em>Levy</em>”), Byles J held (at 528) that if a work had been
                    originally written by two persons in prosecution of a pre-concerted joint
                    design, both might be joint authors of the whole work even though each was
                    responsible for different parts of the work. From this, it followed that if two
                    persons with a common design collaborated to produce a work, they could be
                    regarded as joint authors. On the assumed facts, the court found that there was
                    evidence of a pre-concerted joint design to write the book in question. Further,
                    it appeared that the other individual had read every word of the manuscript and
                    had made alterations, additions, omissions and corrections.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_284"></a>284    Joint authorship is also a concept that is
                    firmly part of the copyright law of Singapore: Susanna H S Leong, <em>Intellectual Property Law of Singapore</em> (Academy
                    Publishing, 2013) at para 06.045. Section 7(2) of the CA states that a
                    "work of joint authorship" refers to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [A] work that has been produced by the collaboration of 2 or more
                        authors and in which the contribution of each author is not separate from
                        the contribution of the other author or contributions of other authors
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Whether a person’s contribution is sufficient to justify the
                    conclusion of joint authorship depends on the circumstances of each case. The
                    task involves an assessment of the quantity and especially the quality of the
                    contribution made by the said person. For the contribution to be relevant, it
                    must be “authorial” in nature and must relate to the <em>expressive</em> elements of the work. This could refer to the
                    literal expressive elements of the work, or the non-literal, structural,
                    expressive elements such as contribution to the details of the plot, characters,
                    and situations in a novel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285"></a>285    The decision of Laddie J in <em>Fylde Microsystems Ltd v Key Radio Systems Ltd</em> [1998]
                    FSR 449 (“<em>Fylde Microsystems</em>”) is
                    also instructive. The plaintiff and defendant co-operated in designing software
                    to be used in radios. The plaintiff claimed that it wrote the program which was
                    installed in the defendant's radios for retail sale. It appears that the
                    plaintiff and defendant cooperated closely in designing the software. There was
                    also continual refinement and improvement of the software. The evidence was that
                    over a five year period, the plaintiff and defendant spent many hours discussing
                    the software and what it was to do. The plaintiff stated that this was to be
                    expected because the software was designed as “specialist bespoke
                    software to be supplied to a technically sophisticated customer”:
                        <em>Fylde Microsystems</em> at 456. According to the
                    plaintiff, it was almost inevitable that such a customer would be intimately
                    involved in monitoring the software as it is developed and suggesting what its
                    functions should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    In Laddie J’s opinion, two matters in
                    relation to authorship had to be addressed (see <em>Fylde
                        Microsystems</em> at 456). First, it was necessary to determine
                    whether the putative author had contributed “the right kind of skill and
                    labour”. If he had, then it was necessary to decide whether his
                    contribution was big enough to justify a finding of joint authorship. Laddie J
                    noted that the latter issue in particular is a matter of fact and
                degree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    Laddie J described the skill and labour
                    contributed by the defendant as falling into five categories: (a) fixing and
                    reporting faults and bugs; (b) making a functional contribution by way of
                    setting the specification for what the software was to do; (c) making a
                    contribution by suggesting what was causing some of the common faults (but
                    without contributing the software solution); (d) providing the technical
                    information on the characteristics of the hardware into which the software
                    fitted and with which it had to cooperate; and (e) setting the parameters and
                    timings within the software. He concluded that these contributions, whilst time
                    consuming and of value, did not amount to contributions to the <em>authorship</em> of the software.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    Another case relevant to our current
                    discussion is <em>Robin Ray v Classic FM Plc</em> [1998]
                    FSR 622. The plaintiff was engaged to advise the defendant (a radio station) on
                    its classical composition repertoire and to catalogue its music library. The
                    plaintiff produced five documents with proposals for the classification as well
                    as a catalogue. Subsequently, in an action for copyright infringement, issues
                    relating to the authorship and ownership of the copyright in the five catalogues
                    and the database arose. In deciding that the defendant was not a joint author of
                    the catalogues and database, Lightman J made the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_a"></a>(a)     A joint author is one who
                        collaborates with another author in the production of a work, who as author
                        provides a significant creative input, and whose contribution is not
                        distinct from that of the other author.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_b"></a>(b)     A joint author must contribute to the
                        production of the work and create something protected by copyright which
                        finds its way into the finished work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_c"></a>(c)     Copyright exists, not in ideas but in the written
                        expression of ideas. A joint author must participate in the writing and
                        share responsibility for the form of expression in the
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_d"></a>(d)     A joint
                        author must do more than contribute ideas to an author.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_e"></a>(e)     A joint author must be an author or
                        creator of the work in question; it is not enough that he thought up the
                        plot of a play, or made suggestions for a comic routine to be included, or
                        passed on his reminiscences to a ghost writer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_f"></a>(f)     Even if there is a division of labour between
                        the two parties, there is no joint authorship if one alone is entirely
                        responsible for the skill and labour of the <em>authorship</em> of the book.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_g"></a>(g)     There is no restriction on the way in which a
                        joint author's contributions may be funnelled into the finished work, and
                        there is no requirement that each of the authors must have exercised
                        penmanship.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_288-p2_h"></a>(h)     There must, however, be something which approximates to penmanship, namely,
                        a direct responsibility for what actually appears on
                paper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    Finally, I consider the English High Court
                    case <em>Hadley</em> v <em>Kemp</em>
                    [1999] EMLR 589. This is a case concerning musical work copyright in pop songs
                    and a claim of joint authorship by a pop band that performed the pop songs. Park
                    J was of the view that in order for a person to be a joint author of a musical
                    work, four elements had to be satisfied: (a) the claimant must have made a
                    contribution; (b) the contribution must have been significant; (c) the
                    contribution must have been original; and (d) it must have been a contribution
                    to the creation of a musical work. The court held that a contribution in terms
                    of mere performance or interpretation of the musical work was not
                enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    The principles which arise from the above
                    cases can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_290-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, authorship always requires a
                        contribution to the <em>expression</em> of the
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_290-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        the mere fact that there is a pre-concerted joint design to produce a book
                        or a work does not necessarily make each party to that design a joint
                        author.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_290-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       While the court in
                                <em>Levy</em> did hold that the writing of a
                            work in accordance with a pre-concerted joint design could result in the
                            work being one of joint authorship, this was said in the context of both
                            parties having contributed to the <em>writing</em>
                            of the work. For example, a publisher who enters into a pre-concerted
                            joint design to produce a book will not ordinarily qualify as a joint
                            author of the work notwithstanding the pre-concerted design and his
                            contributions to the book in the form of type-setting, <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_290-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       In <em>Heptulla</em>, the
                            subject of the biography had made substantial contributions to the
                            expression of the work. He read each line and made numerous alterations
                            and changes to the work. At least for interlocutory purposes, it
                            appeared that he had done more than to merely communicate basic raw
                            ideas or information.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_290-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, whilst authorship is linked to expression, the
                        law accepts that "expression" for copyright purposes includes both literal
                        and non-literal expressive elements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_290-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, intellectual contributions in the form of
                        criticism (such as detection of errors) are unlikely to be sufficient unless
                        the criticisms involve a substantial contribution to the
                    expression.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_290-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth,
                        whilst in many cases, an author will actually be the person who reduces the
                        work to material form, there will be cases where this will not be so. For
                        example, it is clear that an amanuensis is not an
                author.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    In the present case, the evidence as to the
                    quality and quantity of the 2nd Plaintiff’s contribution to the White
                    Get-Up was thin. As described above, we only have the testimony of the 2nd
                    Plaintiff himself, as well as CYX, one of his employees. While I accept that the
                    idea and the basic elements of the White Get-Up came from the 2nd Plaintiff, I
                    am not satisfied that the 2nd Plaintiff contributed enough to be considered an
                    author or joint author of the White Get-Up. In my view, he made no contribution
                    to the White Get-Up as actually expressed; his contributions were limited to the
                    broad ideas behind the White Get-Up, and did not extend to any aspect of its
                    actual expression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    In coming to this conclusion, I do not doubt
                    that the 2nd Plaintiff took pride in his idea and expended effort to procure
                    packaging that he thought would appeal to buyers. This is not enough, however,
                    to establish his claim to authorship. On this ground, I find that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff is not the owner of the copyright in the White Get-Up under the
                    CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Copyright infringement actions in the context of joint
                ownership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_293"></a>293    If the 2nd Plaintiff had proven more
                    substantial contributions to the <em>expression</em> of the
                    White Get-Up, a finding of joint authorship may have been possible. If this were
                    the case, I would have had to consider whether a joint author (as a joint owner)
                    can bring an action for copyright infringement without the other joint owners.
                    Of course, this question is merely academic given that I have found that neither
                    of the plaintiffs is, on the facts, a joint owner of the copyright in the White
                    Get-Up. For this reason I make no further comments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Exclusive license or assignment of ownership to the White
                Get-Up</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a>294    Having found that the plaintiffs are not
                    joint authors of the White Get-Up, it follows that if the plaintiffs’
                    copyright claim in respect of the White Get-Up is to succeed, it must be based
                    on an assignment of ownership or the grant of an exclusive licence to the
                    copyright by the owner of the said copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_295"></a>295    On the facts as I have found it, the author
                    of the White Get-Up is the designer from the Chinese ODM. There is no evidence
                    as to the relationship between that designer and the Chinese ODM. Whilst he may
                    well have been an employee, there is also the possibility that he was an
                    independent consultant. It is thus unclear to me who the <em>owner</em> of the copyright in the White Get-Up is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a>296    In any case, assuming for the sake of
                    argument that the owner of the copyright is the Chinese ODM (<em>ie</em>, that the designer was an employee), the plaintiffs submitted
                    a copy of what was said to be an agreement between the 1st Plaintiff and the
                    Chinese ODM (dated 5 January 2007) into evidence. This agreement was said to
                    effect an assignment of, or the grant of an exclusive license in, the copyright
                    in the White Get-Up to the 1st Plaintiff. The document sets out the following
                        statement:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the artwork of DVD-339K series, white coloured box, external box and
                        panel sticker etc that SINGSUNG Pte Ltd ordered from my company are designed
                        by SINGSUNG. My company is committed to and assures that the artwork design
                        will not be given for use by other clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a>297    The meaning of this statement and the
                    context it was made is unclear. Indeed, the document on its own does not even
                    appear to be set out as a contract. It merely sets out the above bare statement,
                    very much like a declaration. The plaintiffs also did not plead or submit that
                    foreign law applies to the issues of the effectiveness of an assignment of
                    intellectual property rights (if any) or the contractual validity or
                    construction of the document that they were relying on. I will accordingly apply
                    principles of Singapore law in the absence of any assertion or argument to the
                    contrary. Whilst there is no legal requirement that any particular formula of
                    words must be used to effect an assignment or the grant of a copyright license,
                    the words that are used must objectively be capable of being understood as
                    effecting such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a>298    On one interpretation, the statement may be
                    regarded as an admission of some design contribution of the plaintiffs to the
                    White Get-Up, but I am unable to conclude on this basis alone that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff was the author or joint author of the White Get-Up. With respect, what
                    I am concerned with is who is/are the author(s) of the White Get-Up <em>in fact</em>; the Chinese manufacturer’s <em>statement or opinion</em> that the 1st Plaintiff
                    “designed” the White Get-Up cannot take the plaintiffs very far
                    (unless further evidence is adduced as to the meaning the Chinese manufacturer
                    ascribed to “design”). It is clear on the plaintiffs’ own
                    evidence that the 2nd Plaintiff only conceived and discussed the idea behind the
                    White Get-Up with the designer. It was the designer who reduced those ideas into
                    material form. In this “loose” sense, the 2nd Plaintiff could be
                    considered, as the statement says, a “designer” of the White
                    Get-Up. However, this is insufficient to give rise to a finding that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff is the author of the White Get-Up for the purposes of determining
                    copyright ownership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a>299    I must next consider if the statement could
                    be interpreted to be an assignment of, or a grant of an exclusive license to the
                    White Get-Up. Under cross-examination, the 2nd Plaintiff testified that the
                    manufacturer told him that it would not supply the DVD players of his chosen
                    design to anyone else.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> The only evidence for this is
                    the statement referred to above. It is thus to the interpretation of the above
                    statement that I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a>300    In my view, the statement does not purport
                    to assign or transfer any proprietary rights to the 1st Plaintiff. One possible
                    interpretation of the statement may well be that the ODM had <em>contractually promised</em> not to supply the DVD players or the
                    packaging with the White Get-Up design to other persons. This could be implied
                    from the second sentence in the quote at [296] above that “[m]y company
                    is committed to and assures that the artwork design will not be given for use by
                    other clients”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a>301    However, this does not in law or in fact
                    amount to an assignment of, or the grant of an exclusive licence to, the
                    copyright in the White Get-Up. In my view, the statement reads like a personal
                    undertaking by the Chinese manufacturer and can at most only give the plaintiffs
                    a contractual claim against the ODM. There can be no reasonable interpretation
                    of the statement that treats the Chinese manufacturer as having granted the
                    plaintiffs an assignment or exclusive licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a>302    I thus find that on the evidence before me,
                    there was neither an assignment of the copyright in the White Get-Up, nor was
                    there a grant of an exclusive license to the plaintiffs to use the White Get-Up.
                    It follows that the plaintiffs’ claim that its copyright in the White
                    Get-Up was infringed must fail because they do not have any proprietary rights
                    to the said copyright. To be clear, I recognise that the question whether an
                    exclusive licensee is to be treated as acquiring a proprietary interest is
                    unclear. However, this is not a matter that needs to be decided in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does copyright subsist in the White Get-Up in Singapore? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_303"></a>303    In the event that I am wrong and the 2nd
                    Plaintiff is to be regarded as an author or joint author of the White Get-Up,
                    the claim for copyright infringement, properly pleaded, may well succeed. I
                    first discuss whether copyright subsists in the White Get-Up in Singapore
                    assuming that the 2nd Plaintiff is an author/joint author of the White
                    Get-Up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_304"></a>304    The picture created for the box packaging of
                    DVD Player A is an original artistic work. There is no evidence that the
                    expressive elements were copied or taken from any pre-existing work. Even if the
                    picture comprises relatively simple artistic elements, this is not a ground for
                    denying originality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_305"></a>305    Section 27(1)(<em>a</em>) of the CA provides that copyright shall subsist in an
                    original, unpublished artistic work in Singapore if the author was a qualified
                    person at the time the work was made. If the work is published, s 27(2) of the
                    CA provides that copyright subsists or continues to subsist if the first
                    publication took place in Singapore, if the author was a qualified person at the
                    time of first publication, or if the author was a qualified person at his death
                    if he died before the first publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_306"></a>306    As a result of regulations promulgated under
                    s 184 of the CA, the CA has been applied to cover works and other copyright
                    subject matter emanating from most countries of the world. The current position
                    is succinctly set out by Professor Ng-Loy Wee Loon in <em>Law of
                        Intellectual Property of Singapore</em> at para 6.3.10:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_306-p2_a"></a>(a)     An unpublished work now enjoys
                        copyright in Singapore if at the time when the work was made, the author was
                        a citizen or resident of Singapore or another country which is a member of
                        the Berne Union or the World Trade Organisation
                        (“WTO”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_306-p2_b"></a>(b)     A published work now enjoys copyright in Singapore if
                        the work was first published in Singapore or a member country of the Berne
                        Union or the WTO, or if at the time when the work was first published (or at
                        the time of the author’s death), the author was a citizen or resident
                        of Singapore or a member country of the Berne Union or the
                    WTO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_307"></a>307    It follows that the White Get-Up enjoys
                    copyright in Singapore as an original artistic work. If the 2nd Plaintiff is
                    regarded as the author or joint author of the work, his status as a Singapore
                    citizen/resident at the time when the work was made is sufficient for the work
                    to acquire copyright in Singapore. In any case, China is a member of the Berne
                    Union (July 1992) and the WTO (December 2001). Assuming the designer or author
                    was a Chinese citizen or resident at the time the work was first published, the
                    White Get-Up will attract copyright in Singapore. In these circumstances, there
                    is no need to consider the place of first publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assuming copyright belongs to the plaintiffs, did the defendants
                infringe the plaintiffs’ copyright in the White Get-Up?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_308"></a>308    Again, operating on the assumption that I am
                    wrong about the plaintiffs’ ownership of copyright in the White Get-Up,
                    and given my finding that copyright can subsist in the White Get-Up in
                    Singapore, I now briefly discuss whether the defendants’ actions would
                    have constituted copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_309"></a>309    Section 26(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the CA sets out the exclusive right of a copyright
                    owner to reproduce the artistic work in a material form. Where a defendant
                    reproduces the work without the licence of the copyright owner, he infringes the
                    owner’s copyright. Infringement does not require that the artistic work
                    was exactly copied. It is sufficient if a substantial part of the copyright has
                    been taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_310"></a>310    Copyright infringement can arise in a number
                    of different ways. In brief, the first, sometimes referred to as primary
                    infringement, arises pursuant to s 31 of the CA when a defendant does, in
                    Singapore, and without licence, any of the acts comprised in the copyright. The
                    second, sometimes referred to as secondary infringement, occurs when a defendant
                    imports infringing articles into Singapore for trade purposes and/or sells the
                    infringing copies in Singapore: see ss 32 and 33 of the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_311"></a>311    The provisions governing liability for
                    secondary infringement under ss 32 and 33 are complex, especially so in the case
                    of imported articles. Where s 32 is asserted in respect of the <em>importation</em> of an infringing article without the licence
                    of the copyright owner, the relevant copyright owner for the purpose of deciding
                    whether the importation was without licence is the person who is entitled to
                    make the article in the <em>country into which it has been
                        imported</em> (<em>ie</em>, in our present case,
                    Singapore): s 25(2) of the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_312"></a>312    In addition, the importer under s 32 of the
                    CA must <em>know or ought reasonably to know</em> that the
                    imported article <em>was made without the consent</em> of
                    the copyright owner. The identity of the copyright owner for the purpose of
                    deciding whether the article was made without consent is set out in s 25(3) of
                    the CA—it refers to the <em>copyright owner in the place of
                        making</em> (<em>ie</em>, in our present case,
                    China). If such a copyright owner exists, then it is the copyright owner in that
                    place whose consent is relevant so far as the making of the imported article is
                    concerned. If there is no copyright owner in the place of making, it will be the
                    owner of the copyright in Singapore whose consent is relevant. It follows that
                    liability under s 32 of the CA will often require an examination of who the
                    owner of the copyright in the place of making is, and whether that person
                    consented to the making of the imported article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_313"></a>313    Where s 33 of the CA is asserted to catch
                    the <em>sale</em> of imported articles in Singapore, it is
                    necessary to show that the imported article was made <em>without
                        the consent of the copyright owner</em>. Liability here does not
                    depend on the defendant being the actual importer into Singapore. The provisions
                    are directed at any person who is selling the imported articles. Once again, the
                    relevant copyright owner is the copyright owner in the <em>place
                        of making</em> unless there is no copyright owner in the place of
                    making; in that event, the relevant copyright owner is the copyright owner in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_314"></a>314    In the present case, it appears that the ODM
                    in China with whom the defendants had placed the order (a different ODM from
                    that which produced the 1st Plaintiff’s DVD A) reproduced the White Get-Up
                    picture on the box packaging of the defendants’ LS DVD 336A1. Whilst the
                    evidence could have been clearer, no license seems to have been obtained by the
                    defendants for such reproduction. A comparison between the plaintiffs’
                    White Get-Up and the picture appearing on the defendants’ box packaging
                    reveals almost identical images.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span>
                    In fact, under cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant accepted that the White
                    Get-Up had been copied.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> The 2nd Defendant’s
                    explanation was that the White Get-Up had been used by S H Econ on its packaging
                    for DVD players. Any rights in the White Get-Up therefore belonged to the S H
                    Econ partnership, and being a partner, he was entitled to use the White Get-Up
                    as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_315"></a>315    It will be recalled that the 2nd Plaintiff
                    started the 1st Plaintiff and the business of dealing in new electrical products
                    before the S H Econ partnership was terminated. The 2nd Plaintiff’s
                    evidence is that some orders (business of the 1st Plaintiff) were initially
                    processed through S H Econ for business or administrative
                        convenience.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> I accept this evidence. I also
                    accept that this did not mean that S H Econ or the 2nd Defendant had acquired
                    any rights in respect of the 1st Plaintiff’s business. Thus, the 2nd
                    Defendant’s “defence” that he was entitled to use the White
                    Get-Up because of its history in relation to S H Econ cannot stand. In light of
                    this, I now assess whether there would have been copyright infringement if the
                    plaintiffs had owned the copyright in the White Get-Up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_316"></a>316    Based on the above facts, primary
                    infringement has not occurred in Singapore. It is clear that the reproductions
                    of the White Get-Up took place in China. What the defendants did was to place an
                    order for the products in China, and import them into Singapore for sale to
                    overseas trade buyers. The requirement that the reproduction must be done in
                    Singapore in order for primary copyright infringement to take place (see s 31 of
                    the CA) is therefore not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_317"></a>317    However, a good case might have been made
                    that the defendants were secondarily liable for copyright infringement under s
                    32 of the CA. The defendants did import the DVD players with the White Get-Up
                    from China into Singapore for the purposes of sale. The evidence suggests that
                    the articles were not made with the consent of the copyright owner in Singapore
                    (or indeed China). It therefore follows that the defendants would be liable
                    under s 32 of the CA provided it is established that they knew or ought
                    reasonably to have known that the articles were made without the consent of the
                    copyright owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_318"></a>318    Similarly, the defendants are likely to have
                    been liable for copyright infringement under s 33 of the CA because they did
                    sell the infringing DVD players (in its packaging) in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_319"></a>319    Nevertheless, I repeat that the action for
                    copyright infringement in the White Get-Up fails because the plaintiffs have not
                    established that they are the owners of the copyright in Singapore or the
                    holders of an exclusive licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Blue Get-Up</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_320"></a>320    A picture of DVD B and the Blue Get-Up is
                    set out in an annexure to the plaintiffs’ statement of claim. The
                    plaintiffs’ main complaint is that the defendants used the Blue Get-Up on
                    its own box packaging for the 1st Defendant’s DVD players.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_321"></a>321    I now describe the Blue Get-Up in some
                        detail.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> The box is presented
                    in a shade of blue. The brand name “SINGSUNG” appears at the top
                    left corner of one long side. In the centre there is a photograph of the actual
                    DVD player to be found inside the box. On the other long side, the words
                    “Beware of Counterfeit Products” appears in cursive script at a
                    top centre position. At the bottom left, the words “3-year
                    warranty” appears. At the bottom right side, the words “Power
                    Compatible” (in cursive script), the model number DHI, and the words
                    “DVD PLAYER” appear in plain bold font.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_322"></a>322    According to the 2nd Plaintiff, he decided
                    on a blue colour theme for the box packaging. The ODM in China then produced a
                    version of the DHI box which was tweaked by him. After this, SEC joined the 2nd
                    Plaintiff in China and she stayed on for about seven months. During this time,
                    SEC, on instructions from the 2nd Plaintiff, made some further adjustments to
                    the Blue Get-Up. These included changing the uniform blue colour so that there
                    was a subtle gradient (shading) in the blue colour moving from bottom left to
                    top right, as well as making some adjustment to the placement of the brand and
                    wordings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_323"></a>323    I must first clarify exactly what is being
                    asserted as an original artistic work. Based on the pleadings and the
                    plaintiffs’ closing submissions, it is relatively clear that copyright is
                    being asserted only in the photograph of the DVD player, which is one part of
                    the Blue Get-Up, rather than in the Blue Get-Up as a whole.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>
                    Whilst the 2nd Plaintiff may have expended effort in selecting a blue shade, it
                    appears that the core plank of the claim is in respect of the photograph of the
                    DVD player.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_324"></a>324    During cross-examination, the 2nd Plaintiff
                    asserted that he conveyed the idea of using a photograph of the actual DVD
                    player on the box packaging of the DVD Player to the Chinese manufacturer.
                    Whilst it is not clear who the actual photographer was, it appears that the
                    parties have proceeded on the basis that the photograph was either taken by
                    someone from the manufacturer, or that the manufacturer arranged for the
                    photograph to be taken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_325"></a>325    The agreement between the 1st Plaintiff and
                    the Chinese manufacturer of DVD Player B includes the following
                        provision:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Artwork of the entire order of packaged colored boxes (blue), external
                        box, panel sticker of the entire machine etc, are designed by Party
                        A’s company and the exclusive rights of the external appearance belong
                        to Party A. Party B shall not provide the design (including artwork color,
                        typesetting, contents, wordings etc) for the use of other clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_326"></a>326    I am prepared to proceed, at least for the
                    moment, on the basis that the photograph enjoyed copyright in Singapore on the
                    grounds that: (a) the photograph was an original artistic work and (b) that a
                    connecting factor to secure copyright in Singapore was satisfied (<em>ie</em>, the personal status of the author). In making this
                    observation, I note that the defendants assert that the photograph lacked
                    originality because most DVD players come in cartons bearing a picture of the
                    DVD player. This is misconceived. A photograph of a natural scene or a man-made
                    object owes its originality to the skill and effort of the photographer. The
                    fact that photographs of the scene or man-made object are common place is
                    irrelevant. Artistic merit is also irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_327"></a>327    Assuming copyright subsists, I next consider
                    the issue of copyright ownership. Section 30(5) of the CA confers the copyright
                    in a commissioned photograph on the commissioner. Whilst the 2nd Plaintiff has
                    asserted that he acquired the copyright in the photograph in Singapore under s
                    30(5), there is very little evidence on the actual circumstances under which the
                    photograph was taken and provided. This is important because a commissioner can
                    only rely on s 30(5) if the agreement to take the photograph is for valuable
                    consideration. On the evidence before me, it appears that whilst the 2nd
                    Plaintiff asked for photographs to be taken or provided for use as part of the
                    Blue Get-Up, no consideration was specifically provided for the taking of the
                    photograph (if that was in fact what happened). Neither party addressed this
                    point. Nevertheless, I am prepared again, for the moment, to proceed on the
                    basis that the requirements of s 30(5) were met, such as to vest the copyright
                    in the photograph in the 2nd Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_328"></a>328    If copyright did subsist in the photograph
                    in Singapore, and if the 2nd Plaintiff was entitled to claim the copyright under
                    s 30(5), the 2nd Plaintiff may be able to rely on the provisions dealing with
                    secondary infringement and imported articles (as discussed
                earlier).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_329"></a>329    The difficulty which the 2nd Plaintiff faces
                    on the facts, however, is that neither the defendants nor the defendants’
                    manufacturer in China appear to have copied his photographs. I make a number of
                    points on this. First, the 2nd Plaintiff accepted under cross-examination that
                    it was normal or common for the packaging of DVD players to set out a photograph
                    of the DVD player. Second, it appears that the picture or photograph of the DVD
                    players on the defendants’ alleged infringing copies are not reproductions
                    of the plaintiffs’ photographs. As such, there is no copyright
                    infringement because it is not copyright infringement to use the idea of
                    photographing a particular scene. If the defendants or their manufacturer had
                    taken their <em>own</em> photograph of the same DVD player,
                    there can be no copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_330"></a>330    In this case, it appears that the defendants
                    did not copy the plaintiffs’ photograph. I observe that the actual DVD
                    players depicted in the parties’ photographs were of different
                        models.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> That being so, it is
                    clear that the plaintiffs’ photographs could not have been taken by the
                    defendants for their own use. What the defendants did was to take or use the
                    same idea of a blue background on which a picture of a DVD player would be
                    displayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_331"></a>331    In coming to this conclusion, I have noted
                    the plaintiffs’ point that there was some evidence that one of the
                    defendants’ customers provided a photograph of DVD B to the plaintiffs,
                    and that this was passed on to the defendants’ factory in
                        China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> Be that as it may, the photograph
                    provided is not in evidence. Moreover, for the reasons stated above, it does not
                    appear that the defendants or their manufacturer had actually copied that
                    photograph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_332"></a>332    Therefore, even if the 2nd Plaintiff had
                    established his right to copyright in the photograph, the action for
                    infringement fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_333"></a>333    For the sake of completeness, I will
                    consider the possibility that the “Blue Get-Up Picture” may have
                    been a reference to the Blue Get-Up as a whole. In other words, I shall consider
                    if any copyright infringement arises from the alleged copying of the Blue Get-Up
                    as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_334"></a>334    It seems to me that the key artistic element
                    taken (or borrowed) from the Blue Get-Up, colour aside, was the photograph of
                    the actual DVD player. The blue colours of the defendants’ boxes, whilst
                    similar, were in a different shade of blue. The defendants’ brand name was
                    different, and the model numbers used were different. The picture of the DVD is
                    also different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_335"></a>335    Whilst I accept that copyright can subsist
                    in very simple works, it is also an established principle that where the work is
                    so simple that it barely qualifies for protection, nothing but an exact
                    reproduction will amount to the “substantial taking” that is
                    required for infringement. In <em>Kenrick</em>, Wills J
                    held (at 102) that “the mere choice of subject can rarely, if ever,
                    confer upon the author of the drawing an exclusive right to represent the
                    subject” and that whilst the most mechanical representation of the
                    commonest object may enjoy copyright, “nothing short of an exact literal
                    reproduction of the drawing” will amount to infringement. This is an
                    eminently sensible approach to take given the distinction drawn by copyright law
                    between an idea and the expression of the idea. In the present case, even if the
                    Blue Get-Up as a whole is an original artistic work, I do not think there is
                    sufficient copying of the Blue Get-Up as a whole to justify a finding of
                    copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_336"></a>336    For the above reasons, the action for
                    infringement in relation to the Blue Get-Up fails.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subsistence and ownership of copyright</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_338"></a>338    It will be recalled that a key feature of
                    the 1st Plaintiff’s television sets is that the screen could swivel 90
                    degrees on the base plate. Both SEC and the 2nd Plaintiff testified that the
                    sticker was designed by SEC on the instructions of the 2nd Plaintiff for
                    placement on the screen of the television sets. The sticker bore the phrase
                    “Rotary Rotatory” in cursive script, as well as three symbols
                    (simple drawings) depicting gears, cathode ray tubes and the side profile of the
                    television set. Together with the symbols, the following information is set out
                    in the sticker: “90 degrees Rotatable”; “100% Brand New
                    Picture Tube with 3 years warranty”; “Terms and Conditions
                    apply”; and “Ultra slim”. The “SINGSUNG”
                    brand appears in yellow lettering at the bottom of the sticker together with the
                    word “Singapore”. The phrase “Rotary Rotatory” also
                    appears on the housing of the television, above the screen. The plaintiffs refer
                    to this phrase as a logo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_339"></a>339    During cross-examination, SEC gave evidence
                    that the phrase was chosen because it conveyed the essential information in a
                    rhythmic manner. A cursive font was chosen so that the appearance of the phrase
                    matched the flexibility of the television sets (the ability to rotate the screen
                    towards the viewer).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> The witness went on, however,
                    to state that the phrase was the “name of the television” and that
                    it was not “exactly part of the sticker design”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>
                    When asked to clarify what she meant, the witness repeated that what she had in
                    mind was to choose a phrase, by way of naming the television, to best convey the
                    rotating feature of the model.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_340"></a>340    On balance, I accept SEC’s evidence on
                    how the sticker was conceived and developed. Whilst I find that the
                    “Rotary Rotatory” logo (phrase) is not an artistic work in its own
                    right (as will be explained later), I find that the simple line drawings and the
                    arrangement of the elements on the sticker as a whole constitutes an original
                    artistic work. As SEC explained, she wanted to “use simple, easily
                    recognisable images to represent each special feature” of the television
                        set.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> The defendants dispute that
                    SEC is the author of the sticker or the “Rotary Rotatory” logo.
                    They submit that the sticker (and the phrase) was created by the Jin Pin
                    factory, and argue that it was absurd for SEC to claim to have come up with a
                    word-dominated sticker given her evidence that the intended consumers were
                    largely illiterate. Whilst there is something to be said for this, given that
                    there is no evidence from the Jin Pin factory, I accept the evidence of SEC.
                    There is no evidence to suggest that SEC copied the images from some other work.
                    I therefore find that the sticker is an original artistic work as a whole. I
                    also find that its author is SEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_341"></a>341    Section 30(6) of the CA provides that where
                    a work is made by an author pursuant to the terms of his employment under a
                    contract of service, copyright vests in the employer. In the present case, even
                    though no written contract of employment was signed, it is clear that SEC was an
                    employee of the 1st Plaintiff at the time when she conceived and developed the
                        drawings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> There is no requirement that
                    the contract of service must be in writing. The fact that SEC decided to gain
                    some work experience before starting or completing tertiary education, or that
                    she only worked for a short time, does not alter the fact that she was an
                    employee. Her evidence, which I accept, was that she started at the 1st
                    Plaintiff doing administrative work, but moved into design work because she had
                    an interest in that field. Indeed, the evidence establishes that at the time of
                    the hearing, SEC was a final year student at LASALLE College of the Arts.
                    Accordingly, I find that the 1st Plaintiff is the owner of the copyright that
                    subsists over the drawings in the sticker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_342"></a>342    To be clear, I do not find that copyright
                    subsists in the stylised “Rotary Rotatory” logo (phrase) on its
                    own, whether as an original artistic work or literary work (although the latter
                    has not in any case been claimed). I shall now explain the reasons for this
                    finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_343"></a>343    A literary work is a work that is intended
                    to offer information, pleasure or instruction to a reader in the form of
                    literary enjoyment. The significance of a literary work resides in the sequence
                    and the meaning conveyed by the words or notation to the reader. An artistic
                    work, on the other hand, is essentially concerned with visual appearance. The
                    line between the two can of course be hard to draw. Penmanship is admired not
                    just for its informational content; as in the case of Chinese calligraphy
                    scrolls, visual styling can be just as important. Moreover, artistic work is not
                    confined to works of fine art. Corporate logos, comprising just a few alphabets,
                    set out in a stylised form, can be protected as artistic works especially when
                    used in conjunction with some pictorial device. Indeed a signature, which of
                    course comprises, a name, can enjoy copyright as a type of drawing and artistic
                    work. Words and phrases can also be built into or form part of an artistic work
                    (drawing or painting). Consider, for example, a painting of a cat where the
                    image is formed by words and sentences of various lengths, or a map which
                    contains drawings and textual information which can be read. Such images may be
                    treated both as an artistic work and as a literary work (possibly as a
                    compilation of works): Nicholas Caddick <em>et al</em>,
                        <em>Copinger and Skone James on Copyright</em>
                    vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 16th Ed, 2013) at para 3-57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_344"></a>344    In <em>Elwood Clothing Pty
                        Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd</em> [2008] FCA 447 at
                    [16]–[17], the Federal Court of Australia at first instance held that the
                    question whether something is a drawing depends on whether it is (at [15])
                    “designed to convey ‘semiotic’ meaning (ie to be read as
                    text) or rather a visual look and feel (ie to be understood as a
                    design)”. The decision was upheld on appeal by the Full Federal Court at
                    [2008] FCAFC 197. Thus, words and slogans which are stylised and set out with a
                    pictorial device in a particular colour combination may be regarded as an
                    artistic work on the whole for the way in which the various elements have been
                    selected and arranged for the sake of visual appearance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_345"></a>345    Notwithstanding the examples of cases where
                    corporate logos, <em>etc</em>, have been held to enjoy
                    copyright as a species of artistic work, care is needed before reaching the
                    conclusion that two words presented in an ordinary cursive script are to be
                    regarded as an artistic work in its own right. This requires an assessment of
                    the importance of the visual impact over and above the semiotic meaning. Did the
                    author intend the work to be appreciated for its visual appearance? How do
                    members of the public view the words? Ultimately this is a question of judgment
                    for the court. In my view, the phrase “Rotary Rotatory”, even
                    considering the particular font it is presented, is not an artistic work. The
                    evidence is that the phrase “Rotary Rotatory” was chosen as a name
                    to convey a specific meaning to the viewer (potential customer). It was not
                    chosen as part of the <em>design</em> of the sticker. Even
                    though consideration was given to visual appearance, more effort was expended in
                    coming up with the specific words and the intended meaning, rather than the
                    design. Whilst this may not be a conclusive factor on its own, I add that there
                    was no evidence that ordinary persons appreciated the words (or phrase) for
                    their visual appearance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_346"></a>346    What remains is the question whether the
                    phrase can be protected as a species of literary work. To have the literary
                    content of the logo protected requires an assertion of literary work copyright.
                    The use of literary copyright to protect words, titles and slogans has long
                    given rise to its own problems in copyright law. However, there is no need to
                    examine these problems here since no claim to literary work copyright has been
                    put forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there an infringement of the plaintiffs’
                copyright?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_347"></a>347    Given my finding that copyright subsists in
                    Singapore in the sticker as a whole as an artistic work, liability for
                    infringement will arise if the artistic work is reproduced without the licence
                    of the copyright owner. Where the alleged infringing copy is made outside
                    Singapore and then imported into Singapore for sale, the importer will be liable
                    for secondary infringement under ss 32–33 of the CA in the circumstances
                    which have been summarised at [310]–[313] of this judgment. I now consider
                    the evidence that was given on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_348"></a>348    The evidence shows that the 2nd Defendant
                    paid a visit to the same ODM in China, the Jin Pin factory, from whom the
                    plaintiffs had obtained their television sets. The 2nd Defendant’s own
                    evidence on this is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_348-p2_a"></a>(a)     During his visit, he chose rotating
                        television models from a catalogue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_348-p2_b"></a>(b)     He requested that the manufacturer
                        add the phrase “Rotary Rotatory” to the body of the television
                        set and on the stickers to be pasted on the television set.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> He wanted stickers so that the
                        television set would not look so plain and because many other brands such as
                        SAMSUNG included stickers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_348-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whilst the evidence could have been clearer, it seems
                        that the 2nd Defendant’s position is that he came across the 1st
                        Plaintiff’s sticker on a television set whilst he was visiting the
                        Chinese manufacturer’s factory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> This was also when he saw the phrase
                        “Rotary Rotatory” on the 1st Plaintiff’s television
                        sets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_348-p2_d"></a>(d)     He then
                        asked the manufacturer to provide the same stickers and to use the same
                        phrase, but to change the company name or logo.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_348-p2_e"></a>(e)     The manufacturer agreed to provide the sticker.
                        For this reason, the 2nd Defendant was of the view that the sticker could
                        not have belonged to the 1st Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_349"></a>349    The evidence over the circumstances
                    surrounding the 1st Defendant’s orders for television sets from the Jin
                    Pin factory, and in particular, whether the Jin Pin factory was confused or
                    deceived by the 2nd Defendant into thinking that the 2nd Defendant and the 2nd
                    Plaintiff were business partners, was hotly contested.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> What is clear is that two bulk orders were
                    placed by the defendants. After the first bulk order, it appears that the Jin
                    Pin factory refused to accept further orders from the 1st Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_350"></a>350    According to the 2nd Plaintiff, this was
                    because he had complained to the Jin Pin factory about its dealings with the
                        defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> According to the 2nd Defendant, the
                    reason was that the Jin Pin factory chose to stay with the plaintiffs because
                    the 2nd Defendant was not prepared to guarantee a minimum number of orders. The
                    plaintiffs also asserted that the defendants placed a second bulk order with the
                    manufacturer by using a third party to conceal his identity. However, DL, a
                    witness for the defendants, asserted that the second order was placed in this
                    manner at the request of the Jin Pin factory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>
                    The reason why the Jin Pin factory would make such a request was unclear.
                    According to the 2nd Defendant, it may have been because the Jin Pin factory was
                    still keen on his business notwithstanding the complaints of the
                        plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> Either way, the defendants
                    later decided to place orders for television sets from a different Chinese
                    manufacturer. The phrase and stickers were not used on those television
                        sets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_351"></a>351    On balance, I accept the plaintiffs’
                    version of what happened between the defendants and the Jin Pin factory, their
                    Chinese ODM. The evidence of DL, the defendants’ witness, was hard to
                    follow on this point. Her statement that the sales staff at the Jin Pin factory
                    did not refuse to take the order and that the defendants had found the sales
                    service was bad does not explain why the Jin Pin factory required the second
                    order to be placed through another company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> It is more
                    likely that the Jin Pin factory decided not to deal further with the defendants
                    after discovering the history of the relationship between the 2nd Plaintiff and
                    the 2nd Defendant. Thereafter, the defendants concealed their true identity in
                    placing the second order for television sets from the Jin Pin
                factory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_352"></a>352    The evidence being as it is, I find that the
                    stickers made for the defendants’ television sets reproduced a substantial
                    part of the 1st Plaintiff’s sticker. In my view, while primary copyright
                    infringement cannot be established because the reproduction took place in China
                    not Singapore, the defendants nevertheless did infringe the 1st
                    Plaintiffs’ copyright under ss 32 and 33 of the CA by importing and
                    selling television sets with the sticker in Singapore. I now explain my
                    conclusion in a bit more detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_353"></a>353    It will be recalled that liability under ss
                    32 and 33 of the CA for secondary infringement depends ultimately on
                    establishing that the imported article was made without the consent of the
                    copyright owner. It is also necessary to show that the defendant knew or ought
                    reasonably to have known that the imported article was made without consent. I
                    have found that the 1st Plaintiff is the owner of the copyright in Singapore.
                    The question as to whether the sticker enjoys copyright in China is not one that
                    has been addressed by either party. Indeed, even if the sticker is protected by
                    copyright in China, no arguments or submissions have been made as to who is the
                    owner of the copyright in China. Nevertheless, given my findings on the
                    origination of the sticker and its design in Singapore, I am prepared to proceed
                    on the basis that the 1st Plaintiff is also the owner of the copyright (if any)
                    in China. If this is wrong, in that Chinese law does not confer copyright on the
                    sticker in question, the “copyright owner” at the relevant parts
                    of ss 32 and 33 of the CA will, as I previously explained, then refer back to
                    the copyright owner in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_354"></a>354    It is clear to me on the facts that the
                    defendants never received the 1st Plaintiff’s consent to reproduce the
                    stickers and licence to import the stickers into Singapore. Further, I find that
                    at least by the second order of television sets, the defendants knew or ought to
                    have known that consent to the making of the stickers would not be given. This
                    finding is assisted in large part by my previous finding that the defendants
                    deceived the Jin Pin factory about its identity when placing its second
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_355"></a>355    The position in relation to infringement
                        <em>at the time of the first order of television sets and
                        stickers</em> is trickier. The 1st Plaintiff clearly did not licence
                    the importation or consent to making of the defendants’ television sets
                    with stickers substantially the same as that of the plaintiffs (save for the
                    fact that the brand name was changed) at any time. However, the crucial point of
                    difference is as follows. It is wholly unclear whether the 2nd Defendant, at the
                    time of the first order of televisions sets, realised or ought reasonably to
                    have known that the Jin Pin factory did not have the right to produce the
                    sticker for the defendants. After all, the Jin Pin factory was the same ODM from
                    whom the plaintiffs were obtaining their television sets and stickers. Given
                    this lack of clarity, I am not satisfied that it is established on a balance of
                    probabilities that the defendants knew or ought reasonably to have known that
                    the making of these stickers was without the consent of the copyright owner at
                    the time the first order was placed and brought into Singapore. It follows
                    therefore that whilst liability has been established in relation to the
                    defendants’
                    <em>second</em> order, importation and sale of television
                    sets, the claim fails in relation to the first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The floral pattern on the rice cookers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_356"></a>356    The plaintiffs assert copyright in the
                    floral pattern on the side of the 1st Plaintiff’s rice cooker (Model
                        RC-18L).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> The 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s evidence was that when he visited the manufacturer in China,
                    this particular rice cooker model was selected out of the numerous models and
                    patterns which were available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_357"></a>357    I can deal briefly with this claim to
                    copyright. In my view, it must fail for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_357-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, it is clear that the floral
                        pattern was designed by the Chinese manufacturer and was one of many
                        (thousands) that were available for selection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> There is no
                        claim that the design came from the plaintiffs. The fact that the 2nd
                        Plaintiff took the time and effort to select the model and floral pattern
                        does not make him an author or designer of the pattern. As such, the
                        plaintiffs do not own the copyright by virtue of
                    authorship.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_357-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the plaintiffs have not been granted an exclusive license to the
                        floral pattern, nor have they been assigned the copyright in the floral
                        pattern. The plaintiffs claim that certain unnamed employees at the
                        manufacturer’s factory assured the 2nd Plaintiff that the selected
                        pattern would not be offered to other customers from Singapore. First, there
                        is no corroborative evidence that such a promise was made. Second, even if I
                        assume the promise was made, the evidence, even at its highest, does not
                        come close to establishing an assignment of the copyright, or the grant of
                        an exclusive licence in the copyright, to the plaintiffs. A contractual (or
                        non-contractual) promise not to supply the floral design to other
                        Singaporean customers does not amount to an assignment of the copyright, or
                        the grant of an exclusive licence in the copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The start-up screen linked to the DVD players</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_358"></a>358    The start-up screen refers to an image that
                    appears on the television screen when the DVD player is switched on. The image
                    features a snow-capped mountain against a background of a blue sky with the word
                    “SINGSUNG” in the centre and a shining star behind the letter
                    “I”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_359"></a>359    Copyright in the start-up screen is claimed
                    as a copyright to the artistic work. There is no claim to cinematograph film
                    copyright. The plaintiffs’ complaint is that the defendants’ DVD
                    players generated a similar start-up screen. The key difference in the
                    defendants’ start-up screen is that the name “SINGSUNG” is
                    replaced with the 1st Defendant’s brand. The 2nd Plaintiff’s
                    evidence on the development of the start-up screen was brief. In summary, he
                    conceived the idea for the start-up screen and conveyed the idea to the designer
                    at the Chinese factory, but it was the factory designer who reduced the idea
                    into a visual form.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_360"></a>360    On the basis of this evidence, and based on
                    the legal principles discussed earlier on authorship and ideas, I am unable to
                    conclude that the 2nd Plaintiff has a valid claim to be the author or joint
                    author of the start-up screen image. As such, he does not own any copyright in
                    the start-up screen. Moreover, there is no evidence of any assignment or grant
                    of exclusive licence of the copyright in the start-up screen to the
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_361"></a>361    As such, the plaintiffs’ copyright
                    infringement claim in respect of the start-up screen fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on copyright infringement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_362"></a>362    For the reason set out above, all the
                    plaintiffs’ claims for copyright infringement fail, save for the claim in
                    respect of the sticker on the second order of television sets placed by the 1st
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defamation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_363"></a>363    The claim for defamation specifically
                    relates to an assertion that the 2nd Defendant defamed the 2nd
                        Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> For clarity, I note
                    that neither the 1st Defendant nor the 1st Plaintiff is directly involved in
                    this claim. The alleged defamation arises out of certain words spoken by the 2nd
                    Defendant to GEN, a customer of the plaintiffs from Cameroon. The said
                    defamatory words were allegedly uttered on <em>three
                        occasions</em> at the 1st Defendant’s shop premises, and
                    occurred within a span of two weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_363-p2_a"></a>(a)     On the first occasion, the 2nd
                        Defendant apparently told GEN that the 2nd Plaintiff and one “Mei
                        Lan” had worked together to “Ali Baba” him and to take
                        his money. The 2nd Defendant further allegedly said that the 1st Plaintiff
                        had sold defective televisions to a customer from Cameroon named TSH and
                        that as a result, TSH switched to purchasing products from the
                        defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_363-p2_b"></a>(b)     On
                        the second occasion, the 2nd Defendant allegedly told GEN that the DVD
                        players exported by the 1st Plaintiff to Nigeria, Tanzania and Cambodia, all
                        had problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_363-p2_c"></a>(c)     On the third occasion, the 2nd Defendant allegedly repeated the claim that
                        the 2nd Plaintiff had cheated him previously, and stated that the 2nd
                        Plaintiff was “a big Ali Baba man”, “a very crazy
                        man”, and was “very dangerous.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_364"></a>364    The general principles governing the law of
                    defamation are well-settled. To successfully claim for defamation, a plaintiff
                    must show that there is: (a) a statement bearing a defamatory meaning; (b)
                    publication to a third party; and (c) reference to the plaintiff. Having shown
                    this, the burden will then be on the defendant to prove that it has a
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_365"></a>365    In the present case, defences aside, the
                    main issues that arise in relation to the 2nd Plaintiff’s claim for
                    defamation are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_365-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the alleged statements were
                        in fact spoken at all; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_365-p2_b"></a>(b)     if they were so spoken, whether the words bear the
                        alleged defamatory meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I note that if the words were spoken, there is no dispute
                            (save in one area) that the words made reference to the 2nd
                            Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the 2nd Defendant made the alleged statements to
                GEN</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_366"></a>366    The 2nd Defendant admits saying to GEN that
                    the 2nd Plaintiff had “Ali Baba” him and cheated him previously.
                    The 2nd Defendant also accepts that he made the remark that the 2nd Plaintiff
                    was “a very crazy man”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> The 2nd Defendant however denies
                    having told GEN that the 2nd Plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_366-p2_a"></a>(a)     had worked with Mei Lan to take his
                        money;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_366-p2_b"></a>(b)     had
                        cheated him of his money;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_366-p2_c"></a>(c)     had caused SINGSUNG to sell defective DVD players to
                        customers in Nigeria, Tanzania and Cambodia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_366-p2_d"></a>(d)     had caused SINGSUNG to sell defective
                        televisions despite knowing that the products had
                    problems;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_366-p2_e"></a>(e)     was
                        “very dangerous”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_366-p2_f"></a>(f)     was a “big Ali Baba
                man”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_367"></a>367    Having reviewed the evidence and
                    submissions, I find that the 2nd Defendant did tell GEN that the 2nd Plaintiff
                    had “Ali Baba” him and cheated him on the first occasion. I also
                    find that the 2nd Defendant told GEN that the 2nd Plaintiff was “a very
                    crazy man” on the second occasion. I make the above findings on the basis
                    that the 2nd Defendant himself accepts that he said the above words to GEN on
                    the respective occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_368"></a>368    The 2nd Defendant accepts that he did
                    mention something about the 1st Plaintiff’s television sets (first
                    occasion) and DVD players (second occasion) being defective. However, he claims
                    that he was merely repeating what he had been told by some of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s customers. Moreover, these complaints were directed at the 1st
                    Plaintiff, and not at the 2nd Plaintiff. On this basis, it was argued that these
                    words were not in their ordinary and natural meaning defamatory of the 2nd
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_369"></a>369    In my view, none of the points above
                    precludes (at this stage) the statements about allegedly defective televisions
                    sets and DVD players from being actionable in this case. The fact that the 2nd
                    Defendant may have merely been repeating a statement that he had heard does not
                    change the fact that the statements were made, and that they could be
                    defamatory. While the 2nd Defendant might attempt to assert the defence of
                    justification, this is not a matter for this stage of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_370"></a>370    Moreover, on the point that the words were
                    not directed to the 2nd Plaintiff (but only to the 1st Plaintiff), a defamatory
                    statement which at face value is directed at a company can also be found to be
                    directed at or defamatory of the office holders or particular individuals within
                    the company’s management: <em>Gatley on Libel and
                        Slander</em> (Alastair Mullis &amp; Richard Parkes eds) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) ("<em>Gatley</em>") at
                    para 7.13. Much will depend on the circumstances, the context, and how an
                    ordinary reader will interpret the statement. In my assessment of the evidence,
                    given the context of the meetings, an ordinary person in the position of GEN
                    would infer that the statements about the defective television sets and DVD
                    players were directed at both the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_371"></a>371    That said, I note that it is not clear what
                    the <em>exact words</em> said in respect of the defective
                    DVD players and television sets are. I accept that the 2nd Defendant did state
                    (even if only by way of repeating what he had been told) that the 1st Plaintiff
                    had sold defective television sets and DVD players. However, it is not clear
                    whether the 2nd Defendant stated that the plaintiffs <em>knowingly</em> sold the defective products. The implications of this
                    will be seen later in the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_372"></a>372    Finally, I find that the 2nd Defendant did
                    say that the 2nd Plaintiff was “very dangerous” and a “big
                    Ali Baba man” on the third occasion. While the 2nd Defendant denies
                    making any of these statements, I accept GEN’s evidence that the 2nd
                    Defendant did indeed make the above statements to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_373"></a>373    Thus, in summary, I find that the 2nd
                    Defendant did make the following statements about the 2nd Plaintiff to
                    GEN:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_373-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the 2nd Plaintiff had
                        “Ali Baba” him and cheated him (first
                    occasion);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_373-p2_b"></a>(b)     that
                        the 2nd Plaintiff was a “crazy man” (second
                    occasion);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_373-p2_c"></a>(c)     that he
                        was told that the plaintiffs had sold defective DVD players (second
                        occasion) and television sets (first occasion)—though I qualify this
                        factual finding by noting that the evidence does not allow me to make a
                        determinative finding on what exactly was said by the 2nd Defendant in this
                        regard; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_373-p2_d"></a>(d)     that the 2nd Plaintiff was “very dangerous” and a “big
                        Ali Baba man” (third occasion).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the words uttered bear a defamatory meaning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_374"></a>374    Words are considered defamatory if they: (a)
                    lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society
                    generally; (b) cause the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or (c) expose the
                    plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule: Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan,
                        <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy
                    Publishing, 2011) ("<em>The Law of Torts in
                    Singapore</em>") at para 12.014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_375"></a>375    The question whether certain words are
                    defamatory is ordinarily resolved on the basis of the natural and ordinary
                    meanings of the words or phrases. In <em>Chan Cheng Wah Bernard
                        and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal</em> [2012] 1
                    SLR 506 ("<em>Chan Cheng Wah</em>") at [18], the Court of
                    Appeal set out the principles applicable to the construction of words based on
                    their natural and ordinary meanings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_375-p2_a"></a>(a)     the natural and ordinary meaning of
                        a word is that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable
                    person;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_375-p2_b"></a>(b)     as the
                        test is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended to convey is
                        irrelevant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_375-p2_c"></a>(c)     the ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can read between
                        the lines and draw inferences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_375-p2_d"></a>(d)     where there are a number of possible interpretations,
                        some of which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only
                        the defamatory one;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_375-p2_e"></a>(e)     the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the
                        publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus “the bane and
                        the antidote must be taken together”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_375-p2_f"></a>(f)     the ordinary reasonable reader will
                        take note of the circumstances and manner of the
                publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_376"></a>376    
          <em>Gatley</em> at
                    para 2.28 helpfully lists out instances of words held to be defamatory.
                    These include words such as “rogue and rascal”,
                    “crook”, “dishonest”, and even
                    “hypocrite”. Much of course depends on the circumstances and
                    context in which the words are uttered. It may not always be defamatory to call
                    a person a “rascal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_377"></a>377    In the present case, I am satisfied that the
                    ordinary and natural meanings of the words uttered by the 2nd Defendant listed
                    at [373(a)], [373(b)] and [373(d)] of this judgment are defamatory. As the
                    plaintiffs submit and the 2nd Defendant acknowledged in cross-examination,
                    “Ali Baba” is a well-known fictional character famous for being a
                    thief and a cheat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> The expression
                    “Ali Baba”, together with the statement that the 2nd Defendant had
                    been cheated, suggests that the 2nd Defendant had been the victim of some
                    serious wrongdoing on the part of the 2nd Plaintiff. This is especially so as
                    those statements were coupled with other statements that the 2nd Defendant had
                    been cheated of money and that the 2nd Plaintiff was “very
                    dangerous”. Even if, as the defendants submit, this last statement is to
                    be read in the context of the alleged quarrels which the 2nd Plaintiff is said
                    to have had with some customers,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that an ordinary person at
                    the third occasion/meeting (where such sentiments are repeated) would have
                    understood the statement as meaning that the 2nd Plaintiff was dishonest. These
                    aspersions on the 2nd Plaintiff’s character would most certainly lower the
                    2nd Plaintiff in the “estimation or right-thinking members of
                    society”, and even cause him to be “shunned and
                    avoided”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_378"></a>378    In the case of the statements concerning the
                    sale of defective DVD players and television sets to overseas customers
                        (<em>ie</em>, the statements described at [373(c)] of
                    this judgment), the position is less clear. As a preliminary point, I note that
                    the plaintiffs’ closing submissions on defamation are centred almost
                    entirely on the 2nd Defendant’s allegations that the 2nd Plaintiff is a
                    “cheat”, a “crazy man”, and an “Ali Baba
                    man”. Little was made of the statements to do with the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s alleged sale of defective products. In any case, the 2nd
                    Defendant admits that he had informed GEN that a number of the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s customers had told him that some of the 1st Plaintiff’s
                    television sets and DVD players were defective or had problems.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> In their closing submissions,
                    however, the plaintiffs submit that the 2nd Defendant had said that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff had <em>caused</em> the 1st Plaintiff to sell
                    defective DVD players and television sets. This seems to impute some sort of
                    fault on the 2nd Plaintiff’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_379"></a>379    The distinction between the parties’
                    version of the defamatory statements is important. To say that a customer
                    alleges that a company has sold defective products in the past is not
                    necessarily defamatory. Much depends on the context and circumstances. But to
                    say that a company or person has deliberately or knowingly sold defective
                    products is quite a different matter. Whilst the evidence as to what was said
                    could have been clearer, on balance, I do not accept that the words spoken, in
                    their ordinary and natural meaning, bear the meaning that the 2nd Plaintiff
                        <em>caused</em> the 1st Plaintiff to sell defective
                    products. There certainly is no basis in the evidence for me to find that the
                    2nd Defendant said or uttered words that the 2nd Plaintiff had knowingly,
                    deliberately, dishonestly or unscrupulously caused the 1st Plaintiff to sell
                    defective products. As such, I find that the words spoken by the 2nd Defendant
                    in relation to what customers had allegedly said about the 1st Plaintiff’s
                    defective products are not defamatory. To be clear, I do find that the 2nd
                    Defendant stated that the 1st Plaintiff had sold defective television sets and
                    DVD players and/or that some players had problems. On balance, I am not
                    satisfied, however, that the words were defamatory in the circumstances.
                    Electrical goods may be defective or have problems for many reasons. In any
                    case, I note that there is some evidence which supports the 2nd
                    Defendant’s claim that some of the television sets indeed had problems or
                    were defective.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defences</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Justification</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_380"></a>380    A defamatory statement is presumed to be
                    false. The burden of proof falls upon the defendant to plead and show that the
                    defamatory statement is true. The meaning that must be proven true is that which
                    the relevant statement is held to bear. The defence will not succeed if a
                    materially less serious meaning is proven to be true. In short, it is the
                    imputation contained in the words which has to be justified, not the literal
                    truth of the words: <em>Chan Cheng Wah</em> at
                [43].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_381"></a>381    That said, it is established law that the
                    defendant need only prove the "sting" of the charge. In this way, the law
                    provides some leeway for exaggeration and error. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Chan Cheng Wah</em> at [44] accepted the following
                    position laid down by Burrough J in <em>Edwards v Bell</em>
                    (1824) 1 Bing 403 at 409:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it is sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be
                        justified; it is unnecessary to repeat every word which might have been the
                        subject of the original comment. As much must be justified as meets the
                        sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not
                        add to the sting of it, that need not be justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_382"></a>382    In the case of the statements concerning the
                    sale of defective DVD players and television sets, I have decided (see above)
                    that no defamatory meaning has been established. Justification is therefore not
                    relevant. However, I note in passing that at least for the television sets,
                    there is evidence that a consignment of televisions sold by the 1st Plaintiff to
                    TSA (a trade buyer from Cameroon and a witness for the defendants) was
                        defective.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> There is however no evidence
                    that the DVD players sold to the 1st Plaintiff’s customers were defective
                    or had problems. Given the lack of certainty as to what exactly was said, I am
                    of the view that the 2nd Defendant has justified the gravamen of the statement
                    in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_383"></a>383    In the case of the statements bearing the
                    defamatory meaning that the 2nd Plaintiff is a cheat and was dishonest, the 2nd
                    Defendant’s defence of justification is based on facts that arose a long
                    time back when the 2nd Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant were partners at S H
                    Econ. It will be recalled that disputes between the brothers arose over invoices
                    and accounts of S H Econ. By around 2005, the relationship between the 2nd
                    Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant had deteriorated to such a degree that the 2nd
                    Defendant brought a lawsuit in connection with the Shop Houses purchased by the
                    2nd Defendant and SLQ (another brother) and for an account of monies due to the
                    partners from the S H Econ business. The lawsuit commenced by the 2nd Defendant
                    against the 2nd Plaintiff and SLQ in 2007 was settled before trial. The S H Econ
                    partnership was then subsequently terminated (although the date of termination
                    is unclear). It will also be recalled that the 2nd Defendant claims that the
                    business of selling new (as opposed to second-hand) products, or more
                    specifically, “SINGSUNG” products, was started before the S H Econ
                    partnership was terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_384"></a>384    Under cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant
                    accepted that in the settlement agreement, there was no mention of the 2nd
                    Defendant having any rights in or connected with the business of the 1st
                        Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> The 2nd Defendant’s
                    explanation of this in cross-examination was hard to follow. On balance, it
                    appears that his main point was that he had no choice but to accept that he had
                    no interest in the business of the 1st Plaintiff because the family was upset by
                    the dispute and wanted the parties to move on.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_385"></a>385    As I have explained at [315] of this
                    judgment, I accept that the 1st Plaintiff’s business belongs entirely to
                    the 2nd Plaintiff. It has never belonged (even in part) to the S H Econ
                    partnership. As such, in my view, there is no basis in the evidence for calling
                    the 2nd Plaintiff a cheat, or accusing him of dishonesty. The “negative
                    experience” which the 2nd Defendant had from his time in the S H Econ
                    partnership with the 2nd Plaintiff does not come close to justifying the
                    defamatory sting of his words. The defence of justification therefore
                    fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Qualified privilege</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_386"></a>386    The learned authors of <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at para 13.061 state that
                    qualified privilege may arise in one or more of the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_386-p2_a"></a>(a)     where the defendant has an interest
                        or duty to communicate information and the recipient has the corresponding
                        interest or duty to receive the information (“the Interest-Duty
                        Limb”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_386-p2_b"></a>(b)     where the defendant makes a statement with a view to protecting his or her
                        self-interests; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_386-p2_c"></a>(c)     where the supposed defamatory statements are fair and accurate
                        reports of parliamentary and judicial proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_387"></a>387    In <em>Chan Cheng
                        Wah</em>, the Court of Appeal (at [86]) accepted the following
                    explanation of the defence of qualified privilege as found in a previous edition
                    of <em>Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander</em> (Patrick Milmo
                    &amp; W V H Rogers eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2008) at
                    para 14.1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are circumstances in which, on grounds of public policy and
                        convenience, less compelling than those which give rise to absolute
                        privilege, a person may yet, without incurring liability for defamation,
                        make statements of fact about another which are defamatory and in fact
                        untrue. These are cases of qualified privilege ... For a very long time
                        these cases primarily concerned communications of a 'private' nature,
                        commonly arising out of the necessities of some existing relationship
                        between the maker of the statement and the recipient. Protection was granted
                        if the statement was 'fairly warranted by the occasion' (that is to say,
                        fell within the scope of the purpose for which the law grants the privilege)
                        and so long as it was not shown by the person defamed that the statement was
                        made with malice, i.e. with some indirect or improper motive, which was
                        typically established by proof that the defendant knew the statement to be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_388"></a>388    In the present case, the qualified privilege
                    defence pleaded relates to the Interest-Duty Limb described at [386(a)] above.
                    Qualified privilege under this limb arises when it can be shown that the
                    defendant has an interest or duty, whether legal, social or moral, to
                    communicate the information, and the recipient has the corresponding interest or
                    duty to receive the information: <em>The Law of Torts in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_389"></a>389    Reciprocity of duty (between the
                    communicator of the defamatory article and the recipient) is essential. In

                        Ltd</em> (2004) 204 ALR 193 (“<em>Bashford</em>”), the High Court of Australia stated at [63]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the court must consider all the circumstances and ask
                            whether <em>this</em> publisher had a
                        duty to publish or an interest in publishing <em>this</em> defamatory communication to <em>this</em> recipient. It does not ask whether the
                        communication is for the common convenience and welfare of society. It does
                        not, for example, ask whether it is for the common convenience and welfare
                        of society to report that an employee has a criminal conviction. Instead, it
                        asks whether this publisher had a duty to inform this recipient that the
                        latter's employee had been convicted of a particular offence and whether
                        this recipient had an interest in receiving this information. That will

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_390"></a>390    The defence of qualified privilege is
                    defeated by malice. Malice arises where it is shown that the defendant made the
                    communication notwithstanding that he knows that the statement is false or is
                    reckless as to the truth of the statement. Malice will also arise where the
                    defendant has a genuine or honest belief in the truth of the statement but makes
                    the statement for improper motives or purposes falling outside the occasion of
                    qualified privilege. In many cases this will involve showing that the defendant
                    made the statement for the dominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff: <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2010] 4 SLR 331 at [38]. The burden of showing malice
                    falls on the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_391"></a>391    In the present case, I am of the view that
                    the defence of qualified privilege fails for the two reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_391-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, I do not find that the 2nd
                        Defendant has an interest or duty to communicate the information to GEN, who
                        had no sufficient interest to receive this information.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_391-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, I find that the 2nd Defendant
                        made the statements with malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_392"></a>392    On the first point, whilst qualified
                    privilege may arise under the Interest-Duty Limb even if the recipient did not
                    request for the information, the court must examine the importance of the
                    interest to be protected, the urgency of the communication, and the nature of
                    the relationship between the “defamer” and the recipient. In
                    particular, the court should consider whether it is a relationship founded on
                    trust and reliance: <em>Gatley</em> at
                    para 14.34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_393"></a>393    In the present case, by no stretch of the
                    imagination can it be said that the relationship between the 2nd Defendant and
                    GEN is founded on trust or reliance. In my view, based on the evidence, the 2nd
                    Defendant was keen to develop a business relationship with GEN. GEN is merely a
                    potential customer making enquiries as to the defendants’ products. There
                    was no sufficient existing relationship of trust and reliance (or any other sort
                    of relationship) between the 2nd Defendant and GEN to ground a finding of
                    qualified privilege under the Interest-Duty Limb. The 2nd Defendant cannot be
                    said to have had an interest or duty to communicate the defamatory information
                    to GEN.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_394"></a>394    Moreover, I do not think that there is a
                    sufficiently important interest to be protected, or any urgency in communicating
                    the information, such as to privilege the defamatory communications. The
                    statement that the 2nd Plaintiff (his competitor) was an “Ali Baba
                    man” who had cheated him (or behaved dishonestly) related to old events
                    which were long settled. The statements were uttered by the 2nd Defendant over
                    the course of three meetings he had with GEN in late September/early October
                    2011. Viewed broadly, the discussions were in the context of possible business
                    dealings between the 2nd Defendant and GEN.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> By
                    this time, the events which led to the partnership breakup and the dispute over
                    the S H Econ accounts were many years old. The law suit commenced by the 2nd
                    Defendant (OS 1652/2007) was settled in 2008, with both parties agreeing to go
                    their separate ways. In view of the above, I find that GEN did not have any
                    important interest in knowing about the 2nd Plaintiff’s alleged dishonest
                    behaviour which took place so long ago (see <em>Bashford</em> at [63], quoted at [389] above). Moreover, given GEN
                    had been dealing with the 2nd Plaintiff without issue for quite a while already,
                    there is no plausible case that there was any urgency in communicating what the
                    2nd Defendant communicated to GEN.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_395"></a>395    Secondly, I find in any case that 2nd
                    Defendant made the defamatory statements with malice. This defeats the
                    possibility of raising the defence of qualified privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_396"></a>396    Even if the 2nd Defendant genuinely believed
                    that he was cheated by his brother and former business partner, there has been
                    no finding on this and the evidence before me of cheating as opposed to a bitter
                    dispute over accounts is thin. Moreover, the events occurred many years past and
                    were settled. At most, the 2nd Defendant might have explained that he was a
                    former partner of the 2nd Plaintiff and that the partnership had broken up over
                    a business dispute over accounts. To go on to assert that the 2nd Plaintiff is a
                    cheat and an “Ali Baba Man” or a “big Ali Baba man”,
                        <em>etc</em>, strongly suggests an intention to injure
                    the 2nd Plaintiff for reasons of personal spite. The fact that GEN continued to
                    do business with the 2nd Plaintiff and did not change his own view of the 2nd
                    Plaintiff is not a defence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_397"></a>397    For the reasons above, I find that the
                    defence of qualified privilege fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the claim for defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_398"></a>398    It follows that the claim for defamation
                    succeeds in respect of the statements that the 2nd Defendant made, referred to
                    at [373(a)], [373(b)] and [373(d)]. Whilst the 2nd Plaintiff submits that this
                    is a case where aggravated damages are to be awarded, it is my judgment that
                    this is not an appropriate case for the award of aggravated damages. Given the
                    background of the dispute, the fact that the statements were oral, the very
                    limited scope of the circulation, and the fact that GEN did not change his view
                    of the 2nd Plaintiff and continued to do business with him, I am of the view
                    that normal compensatory damages are sufficient recompense for the injury to
                    reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_399"></a>399    In any case, I note that the action has been
                    bifurcated. Thus, I say no more other than that damages are to be assessed at a
                    later date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The counterclaim for malicious falsehood </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_400"></a>400    According to the defendants, sometime in or
                    around 2010, the 2nd Plaintiff obtained a DVD player distributed and sold by the
                    1st Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> The defendants claim
                    that the 2nd Plaintiff dismantled the DVD player in the presence of customers of
                    both parties, pointed to some internal parts and components, and remarked that
                    they were of “poor quality.” This is the factual basis upon which
                    the defendants’ counterclaim for malicious falsehood rests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_401"></a>401    The tort of malicious or injurious
                    falsehood, whilst related to defamation, is governed by its own set of
                    principles. Some of these principles are similar to those that govern the tort
                    of defamation, but there are key differences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_402"></a>402    The principles governing the tort of
                    malicious falsehood are found in the common law as well as s 6(1) of the
                    Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the DA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_403"></a>403    Under common law, to succeed in a claim for
                    malicious falsehood, the plaintiff must prove that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_403-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant published to third
                        parties words which are false;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_403-p2_b"></a>(b)     the words refer to the plaintiff or his property or his
                        business;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_403-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        words were published maliciously; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_403-p2_d"></a>(d)     special damage has followed as a direct and natural
                        result of their publication.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_404"></a>404    Section 6(1) of the DA sets out the
                    circumstances in which it is <em>not necessary to plead and prove
                        special damages</em> in an action for malicious falsehood:</p>

                        for slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, it
                        shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) if the words upon which the action
                            is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and
                            are published in writing or other permanent form; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) if the said words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the

                            business held or carried on by him at the time of the
                            publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_405"></a>405    Whilst the disparaging statement does not
                    have to identify the plaintiff personally, there must be a sufficient (even if
                    indirect) reference to him or his interests. Moreover, the authorities clearly
                    establish that under the tort of malicious falsehood, the <em>claimant</em> bears the burden of establishing the falsity of the
                    statement: <em>DHKW Marketing and another v Nature’s Farm
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 774 at [28]; <em>Challenger Technologies Pte Ltd v Dennison Transoceanic Corp</em>
                    [1997] 2 SLR(R) 618 at [68]. Indeed, this is a key difference between the tort
                    of malicious falsehood and defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_406"></a>406    In support of their submission that it is
                    the 2nd Plaintiff who must prove the truth of his statement, the defendants rely
                    on the earlier case <em>Sin Heak Hin Pte Ltd and another v Yuasa
                        Battery Singapore Co Pte Ltd</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 123
                        (“<em>Yuasa</em>”). In <em>Yuasa</em>, the plaintiff’s action for malicious falsehood
                    succeeded in respect of the defendant’s statements that the
                    plaintiff’s “Yuasa” branded batteries were “illegal
                    imitations” and that the defendant would not be responsible for the
                    quality of the imitation batteries. After stating its finding that the
                    plaintiff’s batteries were authentic “Yuasa” batteries, the
                    court held (at [73]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In relation to quality, there is the additional point that the
                        defendant had not put the batteries which it said were the plaintiffs'
                        batteries through any form of test to ascertain their quality. Therefore the
                        aspersion on the quality of these batteries which appeared in the circular
                        had no basis in fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_407"></a>407    This is the crucial passage upon which the
                    defendants rely. With respect to learned counsel’s submissions, in my
                    view, the court in <em>Yuasa</em> was not holding that the
                    burden of proof was on the defendant to establish the truth of its statements.
                    The finding in respect to the quality disparagement in that case must be seen in
                    the context of the main allegation that the plaintiff’s batteries were
                    imitation Yuasa batteries. The court found on the facts that the batteries were
                    indeed genuine, and not imitations. The plaintiff had already discharged its
                    burden of proving <em>prima facie</em> that the statements
                    were false; the ball was hence in the defendant’s court to prove
                    otherwise. In these circumstances, it is likely that the court was merely
                    holding that the <em>evidential</em> burden shifted onto
                    the defendant to justify its quality allegations. Indeed, my interpretation is
                    strengthened by the fact that the above statements made by the learned judge at
                    [73] was preceded by her clear holding at [70] that the burden was on the
                    plaintiff to prove that the defendant’s statement was false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_408"></a>408    In addition, I note that malice is an
                    element of liability under the tort of malicious falsehood, rather than a matter
                    that defeats certain defences such as qualified privilege and fair comment in
                    the tort of defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_409"></a>409    Coming to the defendants’ counterclaim
                    for malicious falsehood, the critical issues that have to be decided in the
                    present case are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_409-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether and what statements were
                        uttered;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_409-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the statements are false;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_409-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the statements were uttered maliciously;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_409-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether
                        special damage arose as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_410"></a>410    I first consider the evidence on the
                    statements uttered by the 2nd Plaintiff about the 1st Defendant’s
                    products. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), the 2nd
                    Plaintiff admitted that he had dismantled samples of the 1st Defendant’s
                    products. This was said to have been done out of curiosity. Subsequently, under
                    cross-examination, the 2nd Plaintiff denied dismantling the DVD player in the
                    presence of customers and making the comment that certain components were of
                    inferior quality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_411"></a>411    The chief witness for the 1st Defendant on
                    this issue was its customer from Cameroon, TSA. In his AEIC, TSA stated that he
                    had personally witnessed the 2nd Plaintiff dismantling the 1st Defendant’s
                    DVD player. Under cross-examination, the witness explained that the 2nd
                    Plaintiff dismantled the DVD player at the 1st Plaintiff’s office. In my
                    view, the evidence as to what exactly happened is confusing. It is not clear who
                    was present when the 2nd Plaintiff allegedly disparaged the 1st
                    Defendant’s goods, nor is it clear the number of occasions on which this
                    took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_412"></a>412    What is clear is that in 2010, TSA visited
                    Singapore with the intention of looking for business in connection with
                    television sets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> The 2nd Plaintiff met the
                    witness at the airport, and brought to the 1st Plaintiff’s office, where
                    he stayed for about two weeks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> It was during this visit that the
                    witness saw dismantled DVD players on the 2nd Plaintiff’s desk, and heard
                    the 2nd Plaintiff comment on the poor quality of some of the internal
                    components. When asked if he could recall what the components were and the words
                    actually used by the 2nd Plaintiff, the witness, whose oral evidence was given
                    in French, stated that he could try to recall the words spoken by the 2nd
                    Plaintiff in English. The witness then explained in (broken)
                        English:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It---the two DVD supposed on top of the table of [the 2nd Plaintiff].
                        When I arrived in the morning, he say, er, er, [TSA], see, my brother the
                        follow me---my brother follow my product. You see, this one is LS1, the
                        lousy one. This one is, er, Singsung … He make, er, er, er,
                        cheap---cheaper---and---and I don’t know how to explain in English. He
                        make a, er, halo---halo one. The one with no good. It one buy DVD in some
                        market, you must check very well. You can’t see the cable. It’s
                        different until open. Load the memory card, you see, Its not the same, This
                        one is---Singsung is strong one. This one is, er, er, er, not strong one.
                        You see the eyes, it’s different. But he don’t speak English
                        very well ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_413"></a>413    It is apparent that neither the 2nd
                    Plaintiff nor TSA spoke English well, and that there was significant room for
                    miscommunication. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the evidence on the whole
                    supports the view that the 2nd Plaintiff had indeed dismantled a DVD player and
                    made comments on the “lousy quality” of some of the component
                    parts. Other comments made were to the effect that some of the components were
                    cheaper and that the 1st Plaintiff’s product was stronger. On balance, I
                    accept that the 2nd Plaintiff did utter the words complained of to TSA. Whether
                    other customers were present is much less clear and I make no finding in this
                    respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_414"></a>414    I note that in his AEIC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> the 2nd Plaintiff attempted to justify his
                    comments about the 1st Defendant’s products. In particular, he explained
                    that when he dismantled the 1st Defendant’s DVD player he found that the
                    remote control sensors were not as sensitive as those used in the 1st
                    Plaintiff’s DVD player, and the audio and video cables were thinner, less
                    durable and likely to result in more image loss. He also asserted that because
                    the 1st Defendant used lower quality raw materials, its production costs were
                    lower. Whilst the 2nd Plaintiff’s analysis of the 1st Defendant’s
                    DVD player was quite clearly set out in some detail in his AEIC, it does not
                    appear that the specific words of analysis offered to the court in the AEIC are
                    the words that were uttered to TSA. I accept that what is important is the truth
                    of the <em>substance</em> of what was said to TSA; the fact
                    that the 2nd Plaintiff did not use exactly the same words and phrases may not
                    matter. Nevertheless, the evidence as to what the 2nd Plaintiff said to TSA (as
                    described above) leads me to the conclusion that the substance of what was
                    actually said to and understood by TSA was that the 1st Defendant’s DVD
                    component parts (or some parts) were cheaper, “lousy” and not as
                    strong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_415"></a>415    In any case, as I previously stated, the law
                    clearly establishes that the burden lies on the defendants in this case (the
                    claimants in the counterclaim) to prove that the 2nd Plaintiff’s
                    statements are false. Therein lies the difficulty that the defendants face. I
                    note that there is no evidence before the court on whether the 2nd
                    Plaintiff’s statements are false. Indeed, the question arises as to how
                    the truth or falsity of statements such as “this is the lousy one”
                    (in comparison to another product) is to be determined in an objective manner.
                    Moreover, the question also arises as to whether the recipient of the
                    information (TSA in this case) took the 2nd Plaintiff seriously given the
                    context his statement was made in (that is, as a competitor trying to sell his
                    products and win customers).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_416"></a>416    These difficulties bring out an important
                    point. The tort of malicious falsehood is not intended to, and cannot, serve as
                    a vehicle for testing the relative merits of competing products in the market
                    place. It is for this reason that the law is cautious where a complaint arises
                    in the context of comparative advertising. A distinction must be drawn between
                    mere puff and statements that are intended to be taken seriously and whose truth
                    and falsity can be objectively assessed. A statement that Brand X (infant food)
                    is more nutritious and healthier than Brand Y begs the question: in what sense
                    and will this statement be taken seriously? In <em>Timothy White
                        v Gustav Mellin</em> [1895] AC 154, Lord Herschell LC found (at 160)
                    that the advertisement in question was puffing, perhaps extreme puffing. Even
                    so, the action failed. Malicious falsehood cannot be founded on an allegation
                    that one product or service is superior to or better than another. If the law
                    were otherwise, the court’s decision would effectively become a judicial
                    endorsement of a particular brand or product in the market place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_417"></a>417    The position is different where the
                    statement is specific and objectively provable to be either true or false. In
                    such a case, a reasonable man may well be of the view that the statement is
                    meant to be taken seriously. For example, in <em>De Beers
                        Abrasive Products Ltd and others v International General Electric Co of New
                        York Ltd and another</em> [1975] 1 WLR 972, the defendant circulated a
                    pamphlet comparing in great detail the respective performance of the
                    plaintiff’s and the defendant’s diamond-abrasive product. The
                    pamphlet claimed to set out “laboratory developments” and the
                    “application laboratory’s comparative studies” of the two
                    products. It concludes that the plaintiff’s product was inferior based on
                    certain “tests”. In these circumstances, the court found that a
                    case for malicious falsehood might be made out because of the way the pamphlet
                    was dressed up. The court’s reasoning at 981H­–982B is worth setting
                    out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It appears to me that, where the interested parties are presented with
                        what purports to be a proper scientific test, properly carried out by the
                        ‘application laboratory’—whatever that is—they must
                        be intended by the persons who furnished them with this information to take
                        it all very seriously indeed. Such a report framed as the present report is
                        framed cannot be dismissed in any way as a mere idle puff. It may well be of
                        course that that is all in fact it is; but, if so, then the defendants have
                        only themselves to blame for having dressed up a stupid old moke as a
                        thoroughbred Arabian stallion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If traders take the time and trouble to dress up their advertising
                        material in this manner, then I think they must stand by it; and, if it
                        contains, as in the case here, statements in disparagement of the
                        plaintiffs' goods and if, further, on investigation those statements prove
                        to be false and the plaintiff can show malice, the precise constituents of
                        which for present purposes I think it is better not to investigate, it
                        appears to me that they must answer for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_418"></a>418    In summary, it can be seen that whether or
                    not a reasonable person will treat the statement seriously depends on the
                        <em>nature of the statement</em> (especially whether it
                    appears to be reasonably provable as true or false) and the <em>circumstances in which it is made</em>. To be clear, the question as
                    to whether a statement is objectively provable as true or false is distinct from
                    the question whether a reasonable person will take the statement seriously. Even
                    so, the fact that there did not appear to be reasonable grounds for an objective
                    determination must at the least be an important factor in deciding how the
                    reasonable person is likely to regard the statement. In the present case,
                    statements were made by the 2nd Plaintiff during the course of what is perhaps
                    best described as a general, broad-brush, “one-to-one comparison.”
                    The statements when uttered were not supported by any material setting out an
                    independent analysis of the price, strength or quality of the
                components.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_419"></a>419    In these circumstances, I have great
                    difficulty in coming to the conclusion that a reasonable person would take the
                    2nd Plaintiff’s statements seriously. Leaving aside the uncertainty over
                    what was actually said, I am of the view that the reasonable person would regard
                    the statements recounted by TSA as mere puffing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_420"></a>420    In any event, even if a different view is
                    formed, the action still fails because there is no evidence supporting the
                    allegation that the claims were false. Indeed, even at trial, there was no
                    independent evidence or analysis of the quality of the 1st Defendant’s DVD
                    players. The word “lousy” is defined in <em>The New
                        Oxford Dictionary of English</em> as including the meaning
                    “very poor or bad”. That said, the word “lousy” is
                    generally used informally. In what sense were the components
                    “lousy”? What does it mean to say that the component in Brand A is
                    stronger than the component in Brand B? Whilst the statement that the 1st
                    Defendant’s component parts are cheaper than the 1st Plaintiff’s is
                    capable of being objectively proven true or false, no such evidence was before
                    the court. Thus, even if the 2nd Plaintiff did cast a specific disparagement on
                    the remote control sensors, there is no evidence before me on the truth or
                    falsity of the disparagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_421"></a>421    For these reasons, I find that the
                    counterclaim for malicious falsehood fails. In these circumstances, it is
                    unnecessary to determine whether the words were uttered
                maliciously.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The counterclaim for groundless threats of copyright infringement
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_422"></a>422    The defendants’ counterclaim under s
                    200 of the CA for the making of a groundless threat to sue for copyright
                    infringement is based on a letter sent by the plaintiffs’ solicitors on or
                    about 11 April 2011 to the defendants. In the said letter, the plaintiffs’
                    solicitors demanded that the defendants cease and desist from their alleged
                    infringement of the 1st Plaintiff’s copyright in the White Get-Up Picture,
                    the Blue Get-Up Picture, the television sticker, the “Rotary
                    Rotatory” logo, and the floral pattern on the rice cooker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_423"></a>423    Section 200 of the CA provides:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  The mere notification of the existence of a copyright does
                        not constitute a threat of an action or proceeding within the meaning of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)  Nothing in this section shall render an advocate and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)  The defendant in an action under this section may apply, by
                        way of counterclaim, for relief to which he would be entitled in a separate

                        which the threats relate and, in any such case, the provisions of this Act
                        with respect to an action for infringement of a copyright are, with the
                        necessary modifications, applicable in relation to the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_424"></a>424    From the above, it seems that once a claim
                    for copyright infringement fails, the “successful” defendant will
                    have a <em>prima facie</em> claim under s 200 of the CA for
                    groundless threats of copyright infringement proceedings, assuming such threats
                    were previously made. Earlier, I held that the plaintiffs’ claims for
                    copyright infringement failed, save that the defendants’ use of stickers
                    similar to the 1st Plaintiff’s stickers on the second order of television
                    sets imported into Singapore constitutes one instance of copyright infringement.
                    I therefore find that the counterclaim under s 200 of the CA succeeds save for
                    the counterclaim in respect of the sticker and the second order of television
                    sets. The defendants are entitled to the relief prayed for in the counterclaim
                    (save in respect of the stickers on the second order of television
                sets).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_425"></a>425    I note that the plaintiffs have not sought
                    to argue that the counterclaim under s 200 of the CA is defeated because the
                    threat was made in good faith with an honest belief that the act complained of
                    amounted to an infringement of copyright. Australian case law in this context is
                    generally against a defence based on good faith and an honest belief: see
                        <em>SW Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water
                        Systems</em> (1980) 30 ALR 657 and <em>Avel Pty Ltd v
                        Multicoin Amusements Pty Ltd</em> (1990) 97 ALR 19. Whilst it is not
                    necessary for me to decide this point because it was not pleaded, I note that
                    the language of s 200 of the CA supports the view that the <em>only defence</em> available to a defendant who threatens copyright
                    infringement proceedings is proof that the other party <em>actually</em> infringed his copyright (or would infringe if the act
                    was done).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overall Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_426"></a>426    For the reasons discussed above, my overall
                    conclusion is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_426-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiffs’ claim for
                        passing off fails in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_426-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiffs’ claims for copyright infringement
                        fails, save for the claim in respect of the stickers on the second order of
                        television sets from the Chinese manufacturer. Damages or an account of
                        profits (at the plaintiffs’ election) are to be assessed for the
                        copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_426-p2_c"></a>(c)     The 2nd Plaintiff’s claim for defamation succeeds.
                        Damages are also to be assessed in respect of the
                    defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_426-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        1st Defendant’s counterclaim for malicious falsehood
                    fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_426-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        defendants’ counterclaim for groundless threats of copyright
                        proceedings succeeds, save in the case of the stickers on the second order
                        of television sets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_427"></a>427    In addition, the court grants the defendants
                    the following reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_427-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that the threat of
                        legal proceedings against the defendants for copyright infringement by the
                        1st Plaintiff are unjustifiable, save in the case of the claim made in
                        respect of the stickers on the second order of television
                    sets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_427-p2_b"></a>(b)     An
                        injunction to restrain the plaintiffs from continuing or further making such
                        threats, save in the case of the claim made in respect of the television
                        stickers on the second order of television sets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_427-p2_c"></a>(c)     Damages to be
                assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_428"></a>428    Unless costs are agreed, I shall hear the
                    parties on costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_429"></a>429    The history behind the dispute goes back
                    many years and has resulted in several rounds of litigation. The present hearing
                    lasted 16 days and covered a broad range of issues in intellectual and
                    industrial property and defamation. Some of the issues on passing off are
                    relatively new in Singapore. The heart of the dispute concerned the African
                    market (especially Cameroon market) for household electrical products. On all
                    accounts that market has proven lucrative. The evidence is clear that well-known
                    South Korean and Japanese brands compete in that market. The parties have chosen
                    to enter the African market (and elsewhere) with products made in China and
                    supplied to wholesale buyers from Africa under the brand names they have chosen,
                    SINGSUNG and LS. The parties’ products are sold with statements that the
                    goods were made in Singapore, and in some cases, with Singapore quality marks.
                    Whilst some features may cause a raised eyebrow, no issue was raised before me
                    in respect of the parties’ business models. I therefore make no further
                    comment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_430"></a>430    Given the somewhat peculiar nature of the
                    dispute and the substantial issues of fact and law that have arisen, as well as
                    the detailed arguments presented by counsel, the court expresses its gratitude
                    to counsel for the courtesy and respect shown during the course of the hearing
                    and the submissions.</p>
