<p class="Judg-Author">
        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, HSBC Institutional Trust Services
                    (Singapore) Limited as Trustee of Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust
                    (“HSBCIT”), is the proprietor of Suntec City Shopping Mall
                    (“the Mall”). The defendant, Picket &amp; Rail Asia Pacific Pte
                    Ltd (“PRAP”), is in the business of home furnishing and was a
                    former tenant of 3 Temasek Boulevard, #02-106, a shop unit (“the shop
                    unit”) in the Mall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       PRAP leased the shop unit for 38 months from
                    1 December 2007 to 31 January 2011. However, on or around
                    3 December 2008, it abandoned the said shop unit in breach of the lease
                    agreement and ceased its business operations at the Mall. Summary judgment for
                    $233,232.06 was entered against PRAP for its breach of contract on
                    8 September 2009 (“the summary judgment”) by the Assistant
                    Registrar (“AR”), whose decision was affirmed by the High Court on
                    16 November 2009. The judgment sum was in respect of arrears in rent,
                    service charge and contributions towards the promotion fund of the Mall. PRAP
                    was also ordered to pay interest on the sum of $214,005.19 from 15 January 2009
                    to the date of payment at the rate of four per cent over the prime lending rate
                    of United Overseas Bank Limited, calculated on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       PRAP filed an appeal against the decision of the
                    judge who affirmed the AR’s decision. It did not file an application for a
                    stay of the judgment. In the meantime, as PRAP had not paid the judgment sum,
                    HSBCIT served a statutory demand on PRAP on 4 February 2010. When it
                    received no response from PRAP, HSBCIT filed an application to wind up PRAP on
                    27 April 2010. Four days before the hearing of the winding-up petition on
                    21 May 2010, PRAP sought a stay of execution of the summary judgment. I
                    dismissed PRAP’s application and now give the reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the outset, it ought to be noted that
                    although summary judgment was entered against PRAP several months ago, it made
                    no attempt to apply for a stay of the execution of the judgment even when the
                    statutory demand was issued to it on 4 February 2010 and the winding up
                    application was on 27 April 2010. PRAP finally sought a stay of execution
                    of the summary judgment on 17 May 2010, just four days before the date fixed for
                    hearing of HSBCIT’s winding up application on 21 May
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       An appeal against summary judgment does not
                    operate as a stay of execution. O 56 r 1(4) of the Rules of Court
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except so far as the Court may otherwise direct, an appeal under this Rule
                        shall not operate as a stay of proceedings in which the appeal is
                        brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Furthermore, s 41 of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">An appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution
                            of proceedings under the decision appealed from unless the court below
                            or the Court of Appeal so orders.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No intermediate act or proceedings shall be
                            invalidated except so far as the Court of Appeal may
                        direct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The approach which a court should take with
                    respect to a stay of execution of a judgement was outlined in <em>Lee Sian Hee (trading as Lee Sian Hee Pork Trader) v Oh Kheng Soon (trading
                        as Ban Hon Trading Enterprise)</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 869
                        (<em>“Lee Sian Hee”</em>) by the Court of
                    Appeal, which stated at [5]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the court has power to grant a stay, and this is entirely in the
                        discretion of the court, the discretion must be exercised in accordance with
                        well-established principles (<em>Lee Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam
                            Joshua Benjamin</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 772). First, as a
                        general proposition, the court does not deprive a successful litigant of the
                        fruits of his litigation, and lock up funds to which prima face he is
                        entitled pending an appeal (<em>The Annot Lyle</em>
                        (1886) 1 PD 114 at 116). However, when a party is exercising his
                        undoubted right of appeal, the court ought to see that the appeal, if
                        successful, is not nurgatory (<em>Wilson v Church
                            (No 2)</em> (1879) 12 Ch D 454 at 458-459).
                        Thus, a stay will be granted if it can be shown by affidavit that, if the
                        damages and costs are paid, there is no reasonable prospect of together them
                        back, if the appeal succeeds (<em>Atkins v The Great Western
                            Railway Co</em> (1886) 2 TLR 400).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This approach was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       PRAP did not give a satisfactory explanation as
                    to why it took more than 7 months to apply for a stay of execution of the
                    summary judgment. In support of PRAP’s application for a stay of
                    execution, its director, Mr Faisal Alsagoff, filed an affidavit on
                    17 May 2010 stating (at para 4) that his company believed that there
                    was a good chance that its appeal against the summary judgment would succeed. He
                    added at para 5 that it would be “irreversible and grossly unfair to
                    the Defendants” should HSBCIT be allowed to proceed with the winding up
                    and PRAP succeed in its appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In regard to PRAP’s claim that it has a
                    good chance of success in its appeal, the decision of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Lee Sian Hee</em> is instructive. In that case, the
                    respondent obtained summary judgment for the price of live pigs sold and
                    delivered to the appellants. It amounted to $240,403.00. The appellant sought a
                    stay of execution of the summary judgment on the ground that there was a
                    probability of success in the appeal. The Court of Appeal, which refused to
                    order a stay, explained at [9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he likelihood of success is not by itself sufficient,
                            <em>even in the context of an appeal against a summary
                            judgment</em> …. If a bald assertion of the likelihood of
                        success is adequate, then a stay would be granted in every case, for every
                        appellant must expect that his appeal will succeed…. This is quite
                        contrary to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, the Rules of the Supreme
                        Court and to established case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for PRAP’s argument that a winding up
                    order would be “irreversible and grossly unfair” should it succeed
                    in its appeal, there is no allegation – and understandably so – that
                    HSBCIT would not be able to repay the summary judgment amount should PRAP
                    succeed in its appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     HSBCIT feared that if it did not take steps to
                    wind up PRAP, the latter’s creditors would soon be left with nothing.
                    Apparently, PRAP is no longer a going concern and HSBCIT alleged that PRAP has
                    been taking steps to divest its assets to its related companies to avoid having
                    to satisfy the claims of its creditors. HSBCIT discovered during the course of
                    conducting writ of seizure and sale proceedings that in February 2010, PRAP
                    novated its lease at City Square Mall to its related company, Picket &amp; Rail
                    Holdings Pte Ltd. HSBCIT therefore argued that the execution of the summary
                    judgment should not be stayed as it was necessary for liquidators to be
                    appointed to safeguard PRAP’s assets for the benefit of the latter’s
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I agreed with HSBCIT that the filing of the
                    stay application by PRAP so late in the day was a deliberate move intended to
                    delay the winding up proceedings. As such, I dismissed PRAP’s application
                    for a stay of execution of the summary judgment with costs.</p>
