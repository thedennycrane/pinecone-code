<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the Attorney-General
                    to commit Mr Alan Shadrake, the author of <em>Once a Jolly
                        Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock</em> (Petaling Jaya, Malaysia:
                    Strategic Information and Research Development Centre, 2010) (“the
                    book”), for contempt of court in relation to certain passages in the
                    book. These passages are said to scandalise the judiciary by alleging or
                    insinuating that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Singapore Judiciary, in
                        determining whether to sentence an accused person to death, succumbs to
                        political and economic pressures, and more generally does not mete out
                        justice impartially, lacks independence and is complicit in an abuse of the
                        judicial process;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Singapore Judiciary is biased, particularly against the weak,
                        poor and less educated, or is otherwise guilty of impropriety;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Singapore
                        Judiciary is a tool of the People’s Action Party to muzzle political
                        dissent in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the alleged contempt is
                    criminal in nature, the application for committal is made, as is usual in such
                    cases, pursuant to O 52 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law: Generally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The contempt being alleged here is the contempt
                    of scandalising the court. The law in Singapore on this issue can be mainly
                    found in nine reported decisions of the High Court spanning from September 1967
                    to February 2009: ­<em>Re application of Lau
                        Swee Soong</em> [1965–1967] SLR(R) 748
                        (“<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>”); <em>A-G v Pang Cheng Lian</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 271 (“<em>Pang Cheng
                        Lian</em>”); <em>A-G v Wong Hong Toy</em>
                    [1983–1984] SLR(R) 34 (“<em>Wong Hong
                        Toy</em>”); <em>A-G v Zimmerman Fred</em>
                    [1985–1986] SLR(R) 476 (“<em>Zimmerman</em>”); <em>A-G v Wain
                        Barry J</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 85 (“<em>Wain</em>”); <em>A-G v
                        Lingle</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 199 (“<em>Lingle</em>”); <em>A-G v Chee Soon
                        Juan</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 650 (“<em>Chee Soon Juan</em>”); <em>A-G v Hertzberg
                        Daniel</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1103 (“<em>Hertzberg</em>”); and <em>A-G v Tan Liang Joo
                        John</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 (“<em>Tan Liang Joo</em>”). There are other cases which also touch
                    on this issue and I will be referring to them in due course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Counsel vigorously disputed the appropriate test
                    to be applied in deciding whether the statements complained of have scandalised
                    the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ms Subramanian for the
                        Attorney-General submitted that the law has been settled by the decisions
                        set out above. The test to be applied is the inherent tendency test,
                            <em>viz</em>, whether the acts or words complained
                        of had the inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of
                        justice. This test is said to countenance a lower threshold. This is so even
                        though Ms Subramanian accepts that the burden on her is proof beyond a
                        reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Ravi, counsel for Mr Shadrake, argued that the real risk
                        test should be applied, <em>ie</em>, the
                        Attorney-General had to prove that the acts or words complained of had a
                        real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice
                        in Singapore. This test is said to have a higher threshold relative to the
                        inherent tendency test. Mr Ravi argues that other jurisdictions apply
                        the real risk test and we should do the same. Mr Ravi also argues that
                        what Mr Shadrake wrote is also fair criticism and within the right of
                        free speech guaranteed under Article 14 of our
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no Court of Appeal decision on this
                    point. Mr Ravi says I am therefore free to depart from these earlier
                    decisions and urged me to do so as our society is now more mature and more
                    educated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Ms Subramanian for the Attorney-General
                    submitted that the “inherent tendency” test has been affirmed and
                    settled by these decisions, which I should follow. In this regard she cited
                        <em>Mah Kah Yew v PP</em>
                    [1968-1970] SLR(R) 851 and <em>Young v Bristol
                        Aeroplane</em> [1944] 1 KB 718. I do not think that either
                        <em>Mah Kah Yew</em> or <em>Young v
                        Bristol Aeroplane</em> assists the Attorney-General here. <em>Mah Kah Yew</em> did not lay down a rule of horizontal
                        <em>stare decisis</em> for the High Court, and the rule
                    of horizontal <em>stare decisis</em> stated in <em>Young v Bristol Aeroplane</em> is inconsistent with Court of
                    Appeal authority expressly affirming that the High Court is not bound by its
                    previous decisions: see <em>Wong Hong Toy v PP</em>
                    [1985-1986] SLR(R) 656 at [11]. In fairness, Ms Subramanian did
                    concede that I am not technically bound by previous decisions of the High
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is therefore necessary, in light of
                    Mr Ravi’s arguments for changing the test and the law, for me to
                    consider the Singapore cases, the decisions from other jurisdictions cited to me
                    by Mr Ravi, as well as the substantive reasons for and against departing
                    from the present position. However, I must bear in mind that the decisions of my
                    learned colleagues and predecessors over the past four decades are entitled to
                    the very greatest respect and unless there are compelling reasons to do so, I
                    should not depart from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The rationale for the law and its relation with the freedom of
                speech</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It is appropriate to begin the discussion by
                    recalling the rationale underlying the contempt of scandalising the court, a
                    rationale which is often stated but still bears repetition. In Wilmot J’s
                    draft judgment in <em>R v Almon</em> (1765) Wilm 243 at
                    255–256, which was not delivered because the prosecution was dropped, but,
                    according to the reporter’s note, was nevertheless reported because
                    “it was thought to contain so much legal knowledge on an important
                    subject, as to be worthy of being preserved”, the rationale is
                    articulated thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The arraignment of the justice of the Judges, is arraigning the
                        King’s justice; it is an impeachment of his wisdom and goodness in the
                        choice of his Judges, arid excites in the minds of the people a general
                        dissatisfaction with all judicial determinations, and indisposes their minds
                        to obey them; and whenever men’s allegiance to the laws is so
                        fundamentally shaken, it is the most fatal and most dangerous obstruction of
                        justice, and, in my opinion, calls out for a more rapid and immediate
                        redress than any other obstruction whatsoever; not for the sake of the
                        Judges, as private individuals, but because they are the channels by which
                        the King’s justice is conveyed to the people. <em>To be
                            impartial, and to be universally thought so, are both absolutely
                            necessary for the giving justice that free, open, and uninterrupted
                            current, which it has, for many ages, found all over this
                            kingdom</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The importance of public confidence in the
                    administration of justice, emphasised in Wilmot J’s eighteenth
                    century opinion, has continued to receive judicial affirmation across common law
                    jurisdictions in modern times. Lord Diplock declared in <em>A-G v
                        Times Newspaper Ltd</em> [1974] 1 AC 273 at 307
                        (“<em>Times Newspaper</em>”) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in any civilised society it is a function of government to maintain
                        courts of law to which its citizens can have access for the impartial
                        decision of disputes as to their legal rights and obligations towards one
                        another individually and towards the state as representing society as a
                        whole. The provision of such a system for the administration of justice by
                        courts of law and <em>the maintenance of public confidence in
                            it, are essential if citizens are to live together in peaceful
                            association with one another</em>. "Contempt of court" is a
                        generic term descriptive of conduct in relation to particular proceedings in
                        a court of law which tends to undermine that system or to inhibit citizens
                        from availing themselves of it for the settlement of their disputes.
                        Contempt of court may thus take many forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And at 309, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should
                        have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of
                        criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their
                        legal rights and liabilities; secondly, that they should be able to rely
                        upon obtaining in the courts the arbitrament of a tribunal which is free
                        from bias against any party and whose decision will be based upon those
                        facts only that have been proved in evidence adduced before it in accordance
                        with the procedure adopted in courts of law; and thirdly that, once the
                        dispute has been submitted to a court of law, they should be able to rely
                        upon there being no usurpation by any other person of the function of that
                        court to decide it according to law. <em>Conduct which is
                            calculated to prejudice any of these three requirements or to undermine
                            the public confidence that they will be observed is contempt of
                            court</em>.</p>

                        Avon</em>”), the New Zealand Court of Appeal, whose judgment
                    was delivered by Richmond P, stated at 230 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The justification for this branch of the law of contempt [<em>ie</em> scandalising the court] is that <em>it is contrary to the public interest that the public

                        good sense of the community will be a sufficient safeguard against the
                        scandalous disparagement of a court or judge, and the summary remedy of fine

                        enforcement of its laws. The task of enforcing those laws falls on the
                        courts, and on the judges who preside over them. <em>It has
                            always been regarded as vital to the rule of law for respect for the
                            judiciary to be maintained and for their dignity to be upheld. If it
                            were otherwise, public confidence in the administration of justice would
                            be undermined, and the law itself would fall into disrepute</em>.
                        That is the rationale for the branch of the law of contempt known as
                        “scandalising the court”.</p>

                        Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 518, Andrew
                    Phang Boon Leong JA, writing for the Court of Appeal in the context of alleged
                    breaches of court orders, similarly stated at [22] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is imperative to note ... that the doctrine of contempt of court is not
                        intended, in any manner or fashion whatsoever, to protect the dignity of the
                        judges as such; its purpose is more objective and is (more importantly)
                        rooted in the public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The focus on the administration of justice, as
                    opposed to the personal dignity and sensibilities of judges, is reflected in,
                    among other things, the fact that contempt only applies in respect of
                    publications relating to a judge <em>qua</em> judge; it
                    does not apply comments directed at a judge purely in his personal capacity: see
                    the Privy Council’s advice <em>In the Matter of a Special
                        Reference from the Bahamas Islands</em> [1893] AC 138. In
                    theory, the appropriate cause of action in such situations is slander or libel.
                    But to my knowledge our judges have not seen fit in the past to bring such
                    actions, and I do not foresee that they will do so in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is apparent that the offence represents a
                    significant restriction on free speech and expression. In this regard, the
                    common law has, even before the advent of explicit constitutional guarantees,
                    jealously protected the right to make fair criticism of the courts. As Lord
                    Atkin declared in his memorable speech in <em>Ambard v A-G of
                        Trinidad and Tobago</em> [1936] 1 AC 322 at 335
                        (“<em>Ambard</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But whether the authority and position of an individual judge, or the due
                        administration of justice, is concerned, no wrong is committed by any member
                        of the public who exercises the ordinary right of criticising, in good
                        faith, in private or public, the public act done in the seat of justice. The
                        path of criticism is a public way: the wrong headed are permitted to err
                        therein: provided that members of the public abstain from imputing improper
                        motives to those taking part in the administration of justice, and are
                        genuinely exercising a right of criticism, and not acting in malice or
                        attempting to impair the administration of justice, they are immune.

                    approval by more than one of our Singapore cases, spoke to similar effect in
                        <em>R v Gray</em> [1900] 2 QB 36 at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me say at once that we will never use this jurisdiction as a means to
                        uphold our own dignity. That must rest on surer foundations. Nor will we use
                        it to suppress those who speak against us. We do not fear criticism, nor do
                        we resent it. For there is something far more important at stake. It is no
                        less than freedom of speech itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the right of every man, in Parliament or out of it, in the Press or
                        over the broadcast, to make fair comment, even outspoken comment, on matters
                        of public interest. Those who comment can deal faithfully with all that is
                        done in a court of justice. They can say that we are mistaken and our
                        decisions erroneous, whether they are subject to appeal or not. All we would
                        ask is that those who criticise us will remember that, from the nature of
                        our office, we cannot reply to their criticisms. We cannot enter into the
                        public controversy. Still less into political controversy. We must rely on
                        our conduct itself to be its own vindication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I would add the following observations of my
                    own. The relationship between the courts and the public is symbiotic.
                    Individuals depend on the courts to administer justice impartially and
                    effectively; to do so, the courts require the confidence of the public. Without
                    the confidence of the public, the laws administered by the courts cease to
                    embody the collective will of the community; the force of law gives way to the
                    law of force. It is in the public interest that the public confidence in the
                    courts to administer justice in accordance with law does not falter. On this the
                    cases speak with one voice. It is therefore an axiom of the common law that
                    justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen
                    to be done. It is similarly imperative that the public continues to maintain an
                    active interest and trust in the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Judges do not claim infallibility, contrary to
                    what Mr Ravi says. As the Chief Justice said, in discussing courts as
                    institutions: “There are learned judges and less learned judges. There
                    are strong judges and weak judges. There are industrious judges and lazy
                    judges.” See “Securing and Maintaining the Independence of the
                    Court in Judicial Proceedings” [2010] 22 SAcLJ 229 at [30]. Not to
                    acknowledge this fact of life is to act like the proverbial ostrich burying its
                    head in the sand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Neither do judges entertain for a moment the
                    naive conceit that confidence in the courts can be won by sanctioning those who
                    criticise the courts. If anything, unmerited punishment results in derision and
                    resentment. At the end of the day, the confidence of the public can only be won
                    if we faithfully adhere to our constitutional oath to do right by all manner of
                    people after the laws and usages of the land, without fear or favour, affection
                    or ill-will, to the best of our abilities, and to preserve, protect and defend
                    the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There is, nevertheless, a meaningful role for
                    the offence: given the restraint which judges must exercise in replying to their
                    critics, the offence provides an avenue for the Attorney-General, as the
                    guardian of the public interest, to bring to task those who make dishonest,
                    unwarranted or baseless attacks which, if left unchecked, would impair the
                    confidence of the public in the administration of justice. If exercised
                    scrupulously, the power of the court to punish for contempt would have the
                    salutary effect of ensuring that public confidence does not falter as a result
                    of such attacks, without unduly restricting public discussion on the
                    administration of justice. The balance is well-stated by the Chief Justice in
                    [2010] 22 SAcLJ 229 at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... mechanisms such as the doctrine of contempt should not be used to
                        stifle fair and reasonable criticism of the work of the Judiciary and also
                        judicial decisions. The right to criticise is only part of the freedom of
                        speech and expression the citizen enjoys in a democracy and its exercise
                        will encourage or ensure that judges are independent in their
                        decision-making. It is a form of public review similar to judicial review of
                        executive acts, where judges look over the shoulders of the Executive to
                        correct its mistakes. Hence, the doctrine of judicial independence calls for
                        the judicious use of the contempt power, and the final appellate court has a
                        responsibility to ensure a judicial restraint in the use of this power. Fair
                        and objective criticism of judicial decisions will instil accountability and
                        greater discipline in decision-making. If no one is allowed to judge judges,
                        there could be lawless courts and irresponsible judging. But criticism of
                        judgments should not lead to the denigration of judges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Which courts are covered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There was no dispute before me that the
                    contempt of scandalising the court can be committed against the Supreme Court as
                    well as the subordinate courts constituted under the Subordinate Courts Act
                    (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed). This must be right: the offence should extend
                    to all courts exercising the judicial power of the Republic, which under Article
                    93 of the Constitution is vested “in a Supreme Court and such subordinate
                    courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in
                    force.” However, as the subordinate courts only have the power to punish
                    for contempt committed in the face of the court (see s 8(1) of the Subordinate
                    Courts Act), the contempt of scandalising the court can only be punished by the
                    High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Actus reus: Real risk or inherent tendency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I turn to consider the elements required at
                    common law for establishing the contempt of scandalising the court. As
                    mentioned, the appropriate test to be applied is strongly disputed by both
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The fount of the modern law is the judgment of
                    Lord Russell CJ in <em>R v Gray</em>, where he states at
                    40:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any act done or writing published <em>calculated to bring a
                            Court or a judge of the Court into contempt</em>, or to lower his
                        authority, is a contempt of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Russell CJ’s is the first English decision on scandalising
                    the court in the twentieth century, coming a year after Lord Morris declared in
                        <em>M’Leod v St Aubyn</em>
                    [1899] AC 549 at 561, wrongly as it turned out, that:
                    “Committals for contempt of Court by scandalizing the Court itself have
                    become obsolete in this country. Courts are satisfied to leave to public opinion
                    attacks or comments derogatory or scandalous to them.” All the same, it
                    has to be noted that the definition of contempt was not an issue faced by the
                    court, since counsel conceded that the publications in that case were clearly
                    contemptuous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Given the arguments before me, an important
                    question is what Lord Russell CJ meant by “calculated”. Little
                    guidance is provided in his Lordship’s short judgment. Some assistance can
                    be derived from his Lordship’s earlier judgment in <em>R v
                        Payne</em> [1896] 1 QB 577, concerning an alleged
                    interference with pending proceedings. There it was emphasised at 580 that:
                    “Every libel on a person about to be tried is not necessarily a contempt
                    of Court; but the applicant must shew that something has been published which
                    either is clearly intended, or at least is calculated, to prejudice a trial
                    which is pending.” This dictum clearly uses “calculated” to
                    mean effect, in contradistinction to intention, or purpose. But, crucially for
                    present purposes, it leaves unclear whether effect refers to the effect of the
                    publication, read by itself, or the effect of the publication in the
                    circumstances and context in which it was published. This was left to later
                    cases, which I will come to in a moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The “real risk” formulation
                    first appeared in the judgment of the court, delivered by Lord Parker CJ, in
                        <em>R v Duffy, ex p Nash</em> [1960] 2 QB 188
                        (“<em>R v Duffy</em>”), concerning an
                    alleged interference with pending litigation. Lord Parker CJ founded himself on
                    the law as stated by Lord Russell CJ in <em>R v Payne</em>,
                    including the dictum which I have just referred to, as well as the dictum of
                    Lord Goddard CJ in <em>R v Odhams Press Ltd</em> [1957]
                    1 QB 73 at 80: “The test is whether the matter complained of is
                    calculated to interfere with the course of justice.” In concluding the
                    judgment, Lord Parker CJ held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question always is whether a judge would be so influenced by the
                        article that his impartiality might well be consciously, or even
                        unconsciously, affected. In other words, was there <em>a real
                            risk, as opposed to a remote possibility</em>, that the article
                        was calculated to prejudice a fair hearing? In the present case we have come
                        to the clear conclusion that there was obviously no such risk; and that,
                        therefore, the article did not constitute a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is nothing which indicated that Lord Parker CJ intended to
                    depart from the existing law in requiring that there should be a “real
                    risk, as opposed to a remote possibility” that the offending article was
                    calculated to prejudice a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In any event, the real risk standard was
                    approved in <em>Times Newspaper</em>, which concerned an
                    alleged interference with pending litigation. Lord Reid held at
                    298–299:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think the true view is that expressed by Lord Parker C.J. in <em>Reg</em>. v. <em>Duffy, Ex parte
                            Nash</em> [1960] 2 Q.B. 188, 200, that there must be
                            “<em>a real risk, as opposed to a remote
                            possibility.” That is an application of the ordinary de minimis
                            principle</em>. There is no contempt if the possibility of
                        influence is remote. <em>If there is some but only a small
                            likelihood, that may influence the court to refrain from inflicting any
                            punishment. If there is a serious risk some action may be
                            necessary</em>. And I think that the particular comment cannot be
                        considered in isolation when considering its probable effect. If others are
                        to be free and are likely to make similar comments that must be taken into
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At 312, Lord Diplock agreed with Lord Reid’s formulation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, that, given
                        conduct which presents <em>a real risk as opposed to a mere
                            possibility of interference with the due administration of justice, this
                            is at very least a technical contempt</em>. The seriousness of
                        that risk is relevant only to the question whether the contempt is one for
                        which the court, in its discretion, ought to inflict any punishment and, if
                        so, what punishment it should inflict.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the quoted passage from Lord Reid’s speech that

                    was not cited to the Privy Council in <em>Lutchmeeparsad Badry v
                        Director of Public Prosecutions</em> [1983] 2 AC 297
                        (“<em>Badry</em>”), an appeal from
                    Mauritius where the Board considered at 304 that “nothing has intervened
                    in the past 80 years to invalidate the analysis of the first Lord Russell of
                    Killowen in <em>Reg</em>. v. <em>Gray</em> [1900] 2 Q.B. 36”. The constitution of the
                    Board in <em>Badry</em> was completely different from the
                    House in <em>Times Newspaper</em>. Nevertheless, the
                    Board’s analysis at 305–306 of the several publications said to
                    scandalise the court casts light on what it understood to be the long
                    established test in <em>R v Gray</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the Supreme Court [of Mauritius], with knowledge of the conditions
                        local to Mauritius and the nuances of the Creole expressions, is in a
                        position far more qualified to understand its meaning than their
                        Lordships...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It must be said at once that the words found to have been uttered by the
                        appellant in either variant version are vulgar, scurrilous, abusive and
                        lacking in respect to the person of a judge which would be expected, though,
                        were they uttered in this country, it may be doubted whether they would be
                        calculated to lower the authority of the judge rather than the reputation of
                        any public man who uttered them so as to bring them within the condemnation
                        of Lord Russell of Killowen's definition of contempt. Nevertheless ... it
                        may be doubted whether, if the Supreme Court had simply said that in the
                        circumstances prevailing in Mauritius these words were “calculated to
                        bring a judge of the court into contempt or to lower his authority,”
                        this Board would have felt it proper to differ from their opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear that the Board thought that, in deciding whether the
                    publications were “calculated to bring a judge of the court into contempt
                    or to lower his authority”, it was necessary to look at the actual or
                    potential effect of the words in light of the conditions and context in which
                    they were uttered. Therefore, in this regard at least, the traditional test
                    formulated by Lord Russell CJ in <em>R v Gray</em> and
                    applied by the Privy Council in <em>Badry</em> is not
                    different from the “real risk” test formulated by Lord Parker CJ
                    in <em>R v Duffy</em> and accepted by the House of Lords in
                        <em>Times Newspaper</em>. <em>Badry</em> is also instructive for the Board’s observation that
                    what may scandalise the judiciary in Mauritius may not have a similar effect in
                    England.</p>

          <em>Times Newspaper</em>
                    was clearly accepted in New Zealand, where the Court of Appeal held in <em>Radio Avon</em> at 234, after referring to the speeches of
                    Lords Reid and Diplock, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a person] ought not to have been convicted of contempt unless the facts
                        established beyond reasonable doubt that there was <em>a real
                            risk, as opposed to a remote possibility</em>, that the [impugned
                        publication by him] would undermine public confidence in the administration
                        of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In Hong Kong, the Court of First Instance in
                        <em>Oriental Press Group</em> referred to the above
                    authorities and accepted the “real risk” standard, subject to the
                    following two reservations, stated at [55]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first relates to the phrase "a real risk". By adopting that phrase, we
                        are not to be taken as laying down a rule that it must be more likely than
                        not that public confidence in the due administration of justice would have
                        been undermined. <em>The phrase "a real risk" should be given
                            its ordinary meaning. It means a good chance as opposed to a mere
                            possibility. Whether such a risk has been established will depend on the
                            circumstances of each case including the nature of the act done or the
                            language of the publication used. It will also depend on whether there
                            is a pending action or whether the act or publication is targeted at a
                            particular case or at the court or judge generally</em>. The
                        second reservation relates to the section of the public whose confidence in
                        the administration of justice must be affected. We do not think it right to
                        limit consideration to the hypothetical reasonable man, as Goodman JA did in
                        the Kopyto case at p.263: it is just as important that confidence in the
                        administration of justice is not undermined in the eyes of the person who
                        does not address issues rationally. Accordingly, we think that the real test
                        should be: was there a real risk that the acts complained of would undermine
                        confidence in the due administration of justice in the minds of at least
                        some of the persons who were likely to become aware of the publication or
                        acts complained of?</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The appeal by one of the parties to the Court of Appeal was dismissed,
                    with all members of the court agreeing that the “real risk”
                    standard was correct: <em>Wong Yeung Ng v Secretary for
                        Justice</em> [1999] 2 HKC 24 (“<em>Wong Yeung Ng</em>”). The Court of Final Appeal refused leave
                    to appeal further, declaring that: “The courts below have given detailed
                    and cogent reasons for reaching their conclusion ... There is no prospect of the
                    Court of Final Appeal differing from their conclusion”: <em>Wong Yeung Ng v Secretary of Justice</em> [1999]

                        (“<em>Ahnee</em>”), the Privy Council was
                    also to advise in an appeal from Mauritius that “[t]here must be a real
                    risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice”
                    before the offence of contempt was made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Australian position is similar: see
                        <em>R v Hoser and Kotabi Pty Ltd</em>
                    [2001] VSC 443 at [55] (“<em>Hoser</em>”) and <em>McGuirk v University of
                        NSW</em> [2009] NSWSC 1058 at [239] to [272]. In <em>Hoser</em>, Eames J added, at [226] and [228] a
                    practical dimension to the application of the “real risk”
                    test:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The many statements of appellate courts about the need for restraint in
                        the exercise of the contempt jurisdiction are of course important reminders
                        that this is a criminal jurisdiction, and that the courts must be ever alert
                        not to use a significant power to assuage the hurt feelings of judges and
                        magistrates. But against that, in my opinion, the courts should not be so
                        anxious to demonstrate their robustness and lofty disregard for trenchant
                        criticism that they fail to recognise that a concerted campaign against the
                        integrity of the courts and judicial officers, even if employing what the
                        appellate courts might regard to be simplistic and patently absurd arguments
                        may, if unanswered, damage the reputation of the courts, especially at the
                        trial level. It is, after all, more difficult to mount a credible argument
                        that three or five appellate judges are all part of a conspiracy or are
                        tainted by bias than it is to allege that against a magistrate or judge
                        sitting alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The earlier statements of appellate courts, stressing the extreme caution
                        which must be exercised before punishing contempt, must be read now in the
                        light of the new reality that organised and quite sophisticated campaigns
                        against the integrity of the courts, if unchecked, may prove very effective
                        in damaging the reputation of the courts. The “practical
                        reality” of the judicial system being unreasonably damaged must today
                        be considered against the backdrop of the means of mass communication
                        provided by desktop publishing and the Internet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Eames J’s dictum is a useful reminder that the offence of
                    scandalising the court is <em>not</em> based on the
                    sensibilities of judges – if public confidence in the administration is
                    actually or potentially affected, the publication is <em>prima
                        facie</em> in contempt; it matters not that the judge himself prefers
                    to exhibit an attitude of lofty disregard. On appeal, the Victorian Court of
                    Appeal affirmed Eames J’s finding that “there was a real risk
                    that as a matter of practical reality [the impugned publication] had a tendency
                    to undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice and
                    lower the authority of the courts”: <em>Hoser v
                        R</em> [2003] VSCA 194 at [36].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I turn now to the position in Singapore. In
                        <em>Lau Swee Soong</em>, decided soon after
                    Independence, Choor Singh J cited approvingly the “real risk”
                    formulation adopted by Lord Parker CJ in <em>R v
                    Duffy</em>. As shown above, this was the progenitor of <em>Times Newspaper</em> and other decisions which adopted the
                    “real risk” formulation. <em>Lau Swee
                        Soong</em> itself concerned ministerial remarks said to prejudice the
                    trial of the respondent, who was a student charged for rioting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Lord Russell CJ’s test in <em>R v Gray</em> has been cited with approval in <em>Pang Cheng Lian</em>, <em>Wong Hong
                        Toy</em>, <em>Wain</em>, <em>Lingle</em>, <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>, and
                        <em>Tan Liang Joo</em>. I have already considered
                        <em>Badry</em>’s case, which makes clear that
                    Lord Russell CJ’s test requires a consideration of the context in which a
                    publication was made before concluding that it scandalises the
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The “inherent tendency” test was
                    first articulated by Sinnathuray J in <em>Wain</em> at
                    [54]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it is not a requirement of our law, as was submitted by
                        Mr Robertson, that in contempt proceedings it must be proved that the
                        publication constitutes a real risk of prejudicing the administration of
                        justice. <em>In my judgment, it is sufficient to prove that
                            the words complained of have the inherent tendency to interfere with the
                            administration of justice</em>. But, of course, this must be
                        proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage was subsequently to be relied on in other decisions of
                    the High Court. It is, with respect, unhappily worded. It refers to interference
                    with the <em>administration of justice</em>, which is the
                    concern of <em>sub judice</em> contempt, whilst the
                    contempt of <em>scandalising the court</em> is concerned
                    with <em>public confidence</em> in the administration of
                    justice. It also uses the “inherent tendency” formula, suggesting
                    that the words in the impugned publication are to be looked at alone. But it is
                    clear that Sinnathuray J did not mean either of these things. At [61], the
                    learned judge stated that: “In applying the law to the facts in these
                    proceedings, I was mindful of the following general considerations”,
                    before going on, at [61] to [64], to consider the fact that the offending
                    article was contained in a financial newspaper of international repute which
                    enjoyed a wide regional circulation in Asia; written by the president of a major
                    news organisation in the United States; and published at a time when the
                    impugned decision was given saturation coverage in Singapore papers. These
                    contextual considerations relating to the potential effect of the impugned
                    publication would not be necessary if Sinnathuray J truly meant for the
                    offending words to be looked at alone, or if he meant to look at interference
                    with the actual administration of justice. Also, the contextual considerations
                    could not have counted towards sentence, which was considered in a separate
                    judgment: <em>A-G v Wain Barry J</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 108. In the circumstances, I have my doubts that
                    Sinnathuray J meant to depart from the traditional approach; indeed he
                    referred approvingly, at [43], to the dictum in <em>Badry</em> that nothing has intervened to invalidate the analysis of
                    Lord Russell CJ in <em>R v Gray</em>. I have already
                    mentioned that <em>Badry</em> would assess the potential
                    effect of the impugned publication in context. For completeness, however, and
                    with great respect, it should be stated that Sinnathuray J was plainly
                    wrong in distinguishing (at [34]) the English authorities after the beginning of
                    the 1980s on the basis that they were affected by the UK Contempt of Court Act
                    1981 (c 49) – that Act did not regulate the contempt of scandalising the
                    court and this was very clearly stated in <em>Badry</em> at
                    303–304.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The “inherent tendency” test was
                    subsequently referred to in decisions of the High Court and seems to have
                    developed a life of its own. The cases referring to <em>Wain</em> are <em>Lingle</em>, <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>, <em>Hertzberg</em>
                    and <em>Tan Liang Joo</em>. It is necessary to consider
                    precisely what these cases decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Lingle</em>,
                    Goh J referred to <em>Wain</em> for the proposition
                    that it was not necessary to show that a person intended to interfere with the
                    administration of justice before he can be held for contempt. As for the general
                    test Goh J followed <em>R v Gray</em>, describing it
                    as the <em>locus classicus</em> of this area of the law.
                    The only issue in <em>Lingle</em> was whether the impugned
                    publication, an article in the International Herald Tribune, referred to the
                    Singapore courts. Counsel conceded that an allegation that the judiciary was
                    compliant to politicians amounted to scandalising the court. There was therefore
                    no consideration of the “inherent tendency” test. However, it is
                    interesting to note that Goh J referred to the following dictum of Hope JA
                    in <em>A-G of New South Wales v Mundey</em> [1972]
                    2 NSWLR 887 at 911:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the question whether the defendant's statements constituted contempt

                        that the defendant's intention, while of some relevance in this regard, is
                        of importance mainly in relation to whether the matter should be dealt with
                        summarily, if any of the statements did constitute contempt, and in relation
                        to the question as to what penalty, if any, should be imposed.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Goh J’s judgment did not indicate that he saw a difference
                    between the “inherent tendency” formula used by Hope JA, and Lord
                    Russell CJ’s dictum in <em>R v

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em>, the court held at [30] to [31] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30 The position in Singapore regarding the offence of scandalising the
                        court is well settled. Any publication which alleges bias, <em>lack of impartiality</em>, impropriety or any wrongdoing
                        concerning a judge in the exercise of his judicial function falls within the
                        offence of scandalising the court: <em>Wain</em>'s case
                        at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>. A number of local cases
                        including <em>AG v Pang Cheng Lian</em>
                        [1974-1976] SLR(R) 271, <em>AG v Wong Hong
                            Toy</em> and <em>AG v Zimmerman Fred</em>
                        have established that mounting unfounded attacks on the integrity of the
                        Judiciary or making allegations of bias and lack of impartiality, is
                        contempt of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31 Liability for scandalising the court does not depend on proof that the
                        allegedly contemptuous publication creates a "real risk" of prejudicing the
                        administration of justice; it is sufficient to prove that the words
                        complained of have the "inherent tendency to interfere with the
                        administration of justice" (<em>per</em>
                        Sinnathuray J in <em>Wain</em>'s case at
                        [54]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The offending publication in <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em> was a statement impugning the impartiality of the judiciary.
                    It was first read during a bankruptcy hearing and subsequently distributed to
                    media representatives outside the courtroom and copied to 59 separate persons
                    and organisations elsewhere. However, the learned judge in <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> did not advert to this fact in her analysis as to
                    whether the impugned statement was contemptuous, indicating that she understood
                    the “inherent tendency” test to require only an examination of the
                    words used in the publication. For the reasons given above, I am doubtful that
                        <em>Wain</em> is authority for such a proposition. That
                    said, given the circulation of the impugned statement, whose contents were found
                    to be contemptuous, I have no doubt that the facts of <em>Chee
                        Soon Juan</em> would have satisfied the “real risk”
                    test, had it been applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Hertzberg</em>,
                    the court explored the “inherent tendency” test in some detail. It
                    is necessary to quote the judgment at some length:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17 [Mr Jeyaratnam, counsel for the respondent,] submitted that]
                        the court should nonetheless consider (a) whether there was a real risk that
                        the publications would undermine public confidence in the administration of
                        justice and (b) whether the publications were nonetheless protected by the
                        defence of fair criticism. In respect of (a), Mr Jeyaretnam pointed out
                        that what was meant by an "inherent tendency" was not well explained by the
                        local courts, although a decision of the Singapore High Court in <em>Re Application of Lau Swee Soong; Lau Swee Soong v Goh Keng
                            Swee</em> [1965-1967] SLR(R) 748 ("<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>") had explained (at [36]) the term to
                        mean the presence not just of a real risk of interference but "a real and
                        grave one". However, implicit in the more recent decisions such as <em>Wain</em> and the summary of the law in this area
                        provided in <em>AG v Chee Soon Juan</em> [2006]
                        2 SLR(R) 650 ("<em>Chee Soon Juan</em>") at
                        [31], "inherent tendency" was referred to as something less than a "real
                        risk". Mr Jeyaretnam submitted that I should equate "inherent tendency"
                        with "real risk" as was done in <em>Lau Swee Soong</em>
                        and/or adopt the real risk test like other jurisdictions such as England,
                        Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, given that the real risk formulation
                        was clearer and would strike a more appropriate balance between protecting
                        the institution of an independent judiciary and the right of freedom of
                        expression. In his written submissions, reference was made to the New South
                        Wales Law Reform Commission Report on Contempt by Publication (Report No
                        100) which noted that the tendency test had been widely criticised as being
                        "imprecise and unclear, as well as too broad" (at para 4.8).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27 ... The test of liability for the offence, as rightly pointed out by
                        the AG, is simply that of inherent tendency. In other words, a publication
                        which alleges bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing
                        concerning a judge in the exercise of his judicial function would
                        necessarily contain words that have the inherent tendency to interfere with
                        the administration of justice. As borne out in the analysis of the cases of
                            <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> and <em>Wain</em> themselves, the court in each case did not embark on a
                        two-stage approach to determine if contempt was made out but merely
                        proceeded to find if the words complained of did make allegations of bias,
                        lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31 ... in my view, a statement which is said to have an inherent tendency
                        to interfere with the administration of justice is simply one that conveys
                        to an average reasonable reader allegations of bias, lack of impartiality,
                        impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge in the exercise of his
                        judicial function.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32 The next question to ask then is whether Singapore should depart
                        from the "inherent tendency" test and adopt the "real risk" test. Indeed,
                        the "real risk" test appears to be the test presently preferred by many
                        common law countries (see generally <em>Contempt of
                            Court</em> (<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> <em>supra</em>) at para 12.06; see also <em>Time Newspapers Ltd</em> (<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 299; <em>Ahnee</em> (<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 306; <em>Radio Avon
                            Ltd</em> (<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 234; and <em>Wong
                            Yeung Ng</em> (<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 59). The main reason for the
                        adoption of the "real risk" test in these jurisdictions is essentially the
                        need to protect the right to freedom of speech and expression and the
                        broader test based on "inherent tendency" is considered to inhibit the right
                        to freedom of speech and expression to an unjustifiable degree (see also the
                        ALRC's report at paras 428 and 429). The "inherent tendency" test is also
                        criticised for its vagueness and is said to impose liability without the
                        offence being defined in sufficiently precise terms (the ALRC's report at
                        paras 428 and 431).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33 I agree with the AG that what are acceptable limits to the right to
                        freedom of speech and expression imposed by the law of contempt vary from
                        place to place and would depend on the local conditions (<em>McLeod v St Aubyn</em> [1899] AC 549; <em>Wain</em> ([13] <em>supra</em>) at
                        [33]-[38]), as well as the ideas held by the courts about the principles to
                        be adhered to in the administration of justice (<em>Re Tan
                            Khee Eng John</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 870 at [13]). As
                        pointed out by Lai J in <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>
                            (<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> <em>supra</em> at [25]-[27]), conditions unique to
                        Singapore (<em>ie</em>, our small geographical size and
                        the fact that in Singapore, judges decide both questions of fact and law)
                        necessitate that we deal more firmly with attacks on the integrity and
                        impartiality of our courts. Indeed, the ALRC has also recognised the
                        "inherent tendency" test has two clear advantages (the ALRC report at para
                        427). First, it does not call for detailed proof of what in many instances
                        will be unprovable, namely, that public confidence in the administration of
                        justice really was impaired by the relevant publication (<em>cf</em> the "real risk" test which would require some evidence to
                        show that there is more than a remote possibility of harm). Secondly, it
                        enables the court to step in before the damage, <em>ie</em>, the impairment of public confidence in the
                        administration of justice, actually occurs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34 In the light of our local conditions and the advantages that the
                        "inherent tendency" test has, I agree that the "inherent tendency" test
                        should continue to govern liability for contempt of court committed by
                        "scandalising the court" in Singapore. If we need to ask in each case
                        whether there is a real risk that public confidence in the administration of
                        justice has been impaired by contemptuous remarks, it may lead to an absurd
                        situation where a person at a dinner party who keeps shouting to all present
                        that the Judiciary is completely biased will not be held in contempt of
                        court simply because no one at the party bothers about his ranting or is
                        affected by his remarks. It would be more logical in such a situation to
                        hold that contempt of court has been committed and then go on to consider
                        whether there is a real risk that public confidence in the administration of
                        justice has been impaired in deciding whether or not to punish the contemnor
                        and, if so, to what extent. In other words, the issue of the said real risk
                        has no bearing on liability but is relevant only for mitigation or
                        aggravation of the punishment (or even whether or not punishment should be
                        imposed in a particular case at all).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is clear from [31] that the court regarded
                    the “inherent tendency” test laid down in <em>Wain</em> as simply requiring an analysis of the words used, to
                    determine whether they convey to an average reasonable reader allegations of
                    bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge in
                    the exercise of his judicial function. I have already said that I am, with
                    respect, doubtful that <em>Wain</em> can stand for this
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Further, as Mr Ravi suggested, it is not
                    clear that <em>Hertzberg</em> fully appreciated the
                    definition of the law relied on in the two law reform reports which it drew on
                    in support of the inherent tendency test, <em>viz</em> the
                    Australian Law Reform Commission’s Report No 35, “Contempt”
                    (Australian Government Publishing Service: Canberra, 1987), and the New South
                    Wales Law Reform Commission’s Report No 100, “Contempt by
                    publication” (2003): see <em>Hertzberg</em> at [17],
                    [32] and [33]. In criticising the “inherent tendency” test, the
                    former report stated at para 431 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The notion of an ‘inherent tendency’ leaves room for doubt as
                        to how substantial the tendency must be. <em>Obviously, there
                            must be more than a remote possibility of harm</em>; conversely,
                        an inherent tendency seems somewhat less substantial than a ‘real
                        risk’. The alternative formulation – that the statement in
                        question must be ‘calculated to’ impair public confidence etc -
                        likewise leaves room for argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As mentioned, the test in <em>Times
                        Newspaper</em>, <em>Ahnee</em>, <em>Radio Avon</em> and <em>Wong Yeung
                        Ng</em>, referred to at [32] of <em>Hertzberg</em>, defined “real risk” in
                    contradistinction to a “remote possibility”, <em>ie</em> the same way which the Australian Law Reform Commission
                    defined “inherent tendency” in the passage just quoted. (The
                    proposition in the report that an inherent tendency seems somewhat less
                    substantial than a real risk does not find support in the case law.) Therefore,
                    it is unclear why <em>Hertzberg</em> rejected the
                    “real risk” test laid down in those decisions but agreed with the
                    “inherent tendency” test as defined in the report of the
                    Australian Law Reform Commission’s report. As for the report of the New
                    South Wales Law Commission, <em>Hertzberg</em> relied (see
                    [17]) on its section on <em>sub judice</em> contempt, where
                    the law was described as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Current test for
                            liability</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.6 The current test for liability for sub judice contempt is generally
                        formulated in terms of “tendency”.<sup></sup>A publication must be shown to have <em>a real
                            and definite tendency, as a matter of practical reality</em>, to
                        prejudice or embarrass particular legal proceedings, in order to constitute
                        a contempt.<sup></sup>The prosecution bears the burden of proving the necessary
                        tendency, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.7 Liability for sub judice contempt depends on the <em>potential effect of a publication</em> on legal proceedings,
                        rather than on proof of any actual effect the publication may have had. The
                        court assesses the tendency of a publication to cause prejudice by examining
                        the nature of the publication and the circumstances surrounding it, as they
                        appeared at the time of publication...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Speaking for myself, it is difficult to see any practical distinction
                    between, on the one hand, the report’s formula of a “real and
                    definite tendency, as a matter of practical reality” and the requirement
                    to consider the “potential effect of a publication”, and, on the
                    other hand, the “real risk” test articulated in the decisions
                    rejected in <em>Hertzberg</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On the facts, <em>Hertzberg</em> concerned three articles contained in the Wall Street
                    Journal Asia. Given that the contents of the articles were found to be
                    contemptuous, I have no doubt that the facts in <em>Hertzberg</em> would have satisfied the real risk test, had it been
                    applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally, in <em>Tan Liang
                        Joo</em> at [12], Prakash J followed the “inherent
                    tendency” test as articulated by the previous decisions but with an
                    important proviso that context is relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To establish contempt the law does not require that a complainant prove
                        that the act or words created a real risk of prejudicing the administration
                        of justice. It is sufficient for the claimant to prove beyond reasonable
                        doubt that the act or words complained of had the inherent tendency to
                        interfere with the administration of justice (<em>AG v Chee

                            Barry </em>J at [54]; <em>AG v Hertzberg
                            Daniel</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1103 (“<em>AG v Hertzberg Daniel”</em>) at [34]). An act or
                        statement has such an inherent tendency if it would convey to an average
                        reasonable reader or viewer allegations of bias, lack of impartiality,
                        impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge (and, <em>a
                            fortiori</em>, a court) in the exercise of his judicial function
                            (<em>AG v Hertzberg Daniel</em> at [31]), <em>in the circumstances that obtained at the time of the act or
                            words</em> (<em>AG v Wain Barry J</em>
                        at [61]-[64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is significant that Prakash J cites [61] to [64] of <em>Wain</em> as authority for her proposition that the words
                    must be understood “in the circumstances that obtained at the time of the
                    act or words”. Those paragraphs contained no such words. They were, as
                    indicated above, the paragraphs where Sinnathuray J applied the
                    “inherent tendency” test formulated by him to the facts. But, as I
                    noted above, Sinnathuray J’s reference to the context of the impugned
                    publication in those paragraphs, among other things, indicated that he did not
                    mean to introduce a test that was divorced from context. This was clearly not
                    lost on Prakash J, who considered the impugned conduct in context – the
                    wearing of “kangaroo court” t-shirts in the precincts and vicinity
                    of the Supreme Court – before concluding that they scandalised the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     With respect, it is apparent to me that, on
                    close examination, the Singapore authorities are not as clear or settled as
                    Ms Subramanian submitted or as Mr Ravi assumed. Singh J in
                        <em>Lau Swee Soong</em> approved <em>R v
                        Duffy</em>, which contained the “real risk” formula
                    taken up in later cases. Several other cases relied on <em>R v
                        Gray</em>, which as interpreted in <em>Badry</em>
                    required the consideration of the potential effect of the impugned publication
                    in the circumstances in which it was published. <em>Wain</em> adopted the “inherent tendency” formula, but
                    in applying it made clear that the potential effect of the publication must
                    still be considered. <em>Wain</em> also rejected a test
                    based on a real risk of prejudicing the administration of justice. <em>Hertzberg</em> interpreted <em>Wain</em>
                    to mean that a statement which is said to have an inherent tendency to interfere
                    with the administration of justice is simply one that conveys, to an average
                    reasonable reader, allegations of bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any
                    wrongdoing concerning a judge in the exercise of his judicial function.
                        <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> was to similar effect.
                        <em>Hertzberg</em> also rejected a test based on a real
                    risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice, while at
                    the same time referred approvingly to sources which defined “inherent
                    tendency” no differently from the way “real risk” was
                    defined in the Commonwealth authorities. Finally, <em>Tan Liang
                        Joo</em> affirmed the inherent tendency test, but made explicit the
                    need, implicit in <em>Wain</em>, to have regard to the
                    circumstances that obtained at the time of the impugned
                publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Against this state of the law, it is
                    impossible to say that there is a settled approach which binds me, or which I
                    should follow as a matter of consistency between High Court decisions. It is, in
                    fact, necessary to return to first principles and policy considerations to
                    determine what the test should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As can be seen from the authorities I have
                    referred to, the universally accepted rationale for this area of the law of
                    contempt is the preservation of public confidence in the administration of
                    justice. In my view, it follows quite imperatively from this rationale that the
                    doctrine should, at the very most, capture only conduct which has some potential
                    adverse effect on public confidence in the administration of justice.
                    Conversely, the rationale cannot support intervention in conduct which has no
                    actual or potential adverse effect on public confidence in the administration of
                    justice. To the extent that any of the cases contradict this proposition, I must
                    respectfully decline to follow them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I turn now to consider the policy concerns
                    expressed in the various High Court decisions. In <em>Wain</em> at [38], it was said that, differently from other
                    jurisdictions, “the administration of justice in Singapore is wholly in
                    the hands of judges and other judicial officers ... this condition must weigh
                    heavily in the application of the law of contempt in Singapore.” This
                    concern is undoubtedly valid, but in my view it can easily be accommodated in
                    assessing the potential effect of the impugned conduct. Mr Ravi points out,
                    relying on the article by Michael Hor and Colin Seah, “Selected Issues in
                    the Freedom of Speech and Expression in Singapore” (1991) 12 Sing
                    L Rev 296 at pp 306–307, that other jurisdictions have not seen fit
                    to apply a test which differentiates between bench trials and jury trials. But I
                    remain of the view that this is a valid factor: in Singapore any mistake in
                    deciding a case must necessarily be the responsibility of the judge, and cannot
                    be deflected to the jury or anyone else.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em> at [25], it was said that “the geographical size of
                    Singapore renders its courts more susceptible to unjustified attacks”. In
                    support of this proposition <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>
                    referred to <em>Ahnee</em> at 306, where the Privy Council
                    advised, in the context of an appeal from the Supreme Court of Mauritius, that
                    “on a small island such as Mauritius the administration of justice is
                    more vulnerable than in the United Kingdom. The need for the offence of
                    scandalising the court on a small island is greater”. Again I have no
                    hesitation in accepting this as a general proposition. Mathematically, the same
                    conduct will, all other things being equal, have a greater actual or potential
                    effect in a jurisdiction with a smaller bench, a smaller population and a
                    smaller land area. However, I should point out, with all due respect, that
                    immediately after making the quoted remarks, the Privy Council went on to make
                    clear that “[t]here must be a real risk of undermining public confidence
                    in the administration of justice” before the offence was made out. It is
                    also pertinent to note that, in <em>Wong Yeung Ng</em>,
                    Mortimer V-P in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s
                    adoption of the “real risk” standard (see above), even as he
                    cautioned at [55] of his judgment that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the relatively small size of the Hong Kong's legal system is
                        important. As is demonstrated in this case communication with a very
                        substantial proportion of the population is easily achieved. Proceedings in
                        court are widely publicised. Many judges are known by name because of this
                        reporting. Confidence in our legal system, the maintenance of the rule of
                        law and the authority of the court are matters of special importance in our
                        society. There are frequent, if misconceived, expressions of anxiety in this
                        respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Hertzberg</em> at
                    [33]–[34], which I set out again, it was said that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    I agree with the AG that what are acceptable limits
                            to the right to freedom of speech and expression imposed by the law of
                            contempt vary from place to place and would depend on the local
                            conditions (<em>McLeod v St Aubyn</em>
                            [1899] AC 549; <em>Wain</em> ([13] supra)
                            at [33]-[38]), as well as the ideas held by the courts about the
                            principles to be adhered to in the administration of justice (<em>Re Tan Khee Eng John</em> [1997]
                            1 SLR(R) 870 at [13]). As pointed out by Lai J in
                                <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> ([17] supra at
                            [25]-[27]), conditions unique to Singapore (ie, our small geographical
                            size and the fact that in Singapore, judges decide both questions of
                            fact and law) necessitate that we deal more firmly with attacks on the
                            integrity and impartiality of our courts. Indeed, the ALRC has also
                            recognised the "inherent tendency" test has two clear advantages (the
                            ALRC report at para 427). First, it does not call for detailed proof of
                            what in many instances will be unprovable, namely, that public
                            confidence in the administration of justice really was impaired by the
                            relevant publication (<em>cf</em> the "real risk"
                            test which would require some evidence to show that there is more than a
                            remote possibility of harm). Secondly, it enables the court to step in
                            before the damage, <em>ie</em>, the impairment of
                            public confidence in the administration of justice, actually
                            occurs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    In the light of our local conditions and the
                            advantages that the "inherent tendency" test has, I agree that the
                            "inherent tendency" test should continue to govern liability for
                            contempt of court committed by "scandalising the court" in Singapore. If
                            we need to ask in each case whether there is a real risk that public
                            confidence in the administration of justice has been impaired by
                            contemptuous remarks, it may lead to an absurd situation where a person
                            at a dinner party who keeps shouting to all present that the Judiciary
                            is completely biased will not be held in contempt of court simply
                            because no one at the party bothers about his ranting or is affected by
                            his remarks...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The two concerns at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> can
                    well be met by a test which includes the potential, and not merely the actual,
                    effect of the impugned conduct. As for the hypothetical given at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>, it would be an overzealous judiciary that
                    would regard rants (and especially inebriated rants) at a dinner party as
                    undermining public confidence in the administration of justice when no one takes
                    serious notice of or is bothered by those rants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In my judgment, the policy concerns
                    articulated above require a test which is based on the potential adverse effect
                    of the impugned conduct, as assessed in the circumstances above. They do not
                    require a test wider than that. As for what degree of potentiality is required,
                    I think that there is no need for the law to intervene when the potential
                    adverse effect on the administration is <em>de
                    minimis</em>, remote or fanciful. The law does not concern itself with
                    trifles, and the law of contempt is no exception. To the extent that the cases
                    say otherwise, I would, with the greatest of respect, decline to follow
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In my view, the various formulae adopted in
                    the cases – conduct calculated to lower the authority of the court,
                    conduct having the inherent tendency of conveying allegations of bias and other
                    impropriety against the court, and conduct posing a real risk of undermining
                    public confidence in the administration of justice, and so on – are not
                    inconsistent with what I have said. Both counsel seemed to have proceeded on the
                    basis that there was a significant difference between the real risk test urged
                    by Mr Ravi and the inherent tendency test defended by Ms Subramanian.
                    I very much doubt this is the case. Here it is appropriate to go back to Lord
                    Reid’s speech in <em>Times Newspaper</em>, which I
                    set out again:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think the true view is that expressed by Lord Parker C.J. in <em>Reg. v. Duffy, Ex parte Nash</em> [1960]
                        2 Q.B. 188, 200, that there must be "<em>a real
                            risk, as opposed to a remote possibility</em>." That is an
                        application of the ordinary <em>de minimis
                            principle</em>. <em>There is no contempt if the
                            possibility of influence is remote. If there is some but only a small
                            likelihood, that may influence the court to refrain from inflicting any
                            punishment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Reid was defining a real risk in contradistinction to a remote
                    possibility, and that he considered this to be an application of the <em>de minimis</em> principle, which is the general principle
                    that courts of justice do not take trifling and immaterial matters into account:
                        <em>Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law</em>, 3rd
                    ed (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010), vol 1 at p 642. I do not think that the
                    inherent tendency test, as formulated in <em>Wain</em>,
                    goes wider than that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     But at the end of the day I must settle on a
                    formula, and in doing so I would adopt the attitude of the English Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Times Newspaper</em>, [1973]
                    1 QB 710 at 725:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We think that all these judicial definitions are attempting to describe
                        the same thing, and we do not intend to increase the confusion by adding yet
                        another definition of our own. It may be that to a lawyer the word
                        "calculated" is precise enough, but the decision to publish or not must
                        often be taken by a layman, and we would prefer to adopt the words which are
                        most helpful to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Now, if it were a pure question of semantics I would see no reason to
                    depart from the “inherent tendency” formula established in
                        <em>Wain</em>, which, as I read it, required an
                    assessment of the effect of the impugned publication in the context it was made.
                    But, with respect, that formula has shown itself to be susceptible of
                    controversy and misunderstanding, not least because the literal meaning of
                        <em>inherent</em> tendency tends to obscure the fact
                    that a <em>contextual</em> analysis is actually required.
                    Indeed, given how the word “inherent” is commonly understood to
                    indicate something <em>intrinsic</em>, an inherent tendency
                    test would therefore appear to preclude any consideration of extrinsic factors.
                    This unnecessary complication need not exist. Similarly, the test has also
                    appeared at times to encompass, in theory at least, publications which have no
                    potential effect on public confidence in the administration of justice. I would
                    therefore prefer the “real risk” formula, that is, a publication
                    must pose a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of
                    justice before it is held to be contemptuous. This formula, in my view,
                    precisely conveys to the layman, and indeed to lawyers, what the law is
                    concerned with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I should emphasise several aspects of the
                    test. First, a real risk, as defined in the cases, is not to be equated with a
                    serious or grave risk, but merely something more than a <em>de
                        minimis</em>, remote or fanciful risk. It must have substance, but
                    need not be substantial. <em>A fortiori</em>, it is not
                    necessary to show that public confidence was actually undermined by the impugned
                    publication. As Lord Reid made clear in his speech in <em>Times
                        Newspaper</em>, any degree of risk above the <em>de
                        minimis</em> level, including “a small likelihood”, is a
                    contempt, with the seriousness of the risk going only to mitigation. For good
                    measure, I should reiterate that the facts of the Singapore cases where the
                    “inherent tendency” test was applied –
                    <em>viz Wain</em>, <em>Chee Soon Juan,
                        Hertzberg</em> and <em>Tan Liang Joo</em> –
                    would have satisfied the “real risk” test as I have stated
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Secondly, whether such a real risk is posed is
                    eminently an objective question of fact to be determined in light of all the
                    circumstances of the case, including the author and nature of the publication
                    and the scope of its dissemination (<em>Wain</em>), and
                    bearing in mind local conditions (<em>Badry</em>). In this
                    last regard, important considerations include the fact that we are a small,
                    crowded, multiracial and multi-religious nation, where information travels
                    rapidly and where social tensions, if developed and brought to a boil, will
                    rapidly propagate. Some of the factors emphasised in the cases should also be
                    borne in mind. The first is that raised in <em>Oriental Press
                        Group</em> at [55], that those who come into contact with the impugned
                    publication may not always be average reasonable persons. They may be less
                    rational, or, I should add, they may be more discriminating. It is therefore not
                    always appropriate to assess the real risk to public confidence by reference to
                    the average reasonable person – the appropriate reference point depends on
                    the facts of each case. The second consideration is that raised in <em>Wong Yeung Ng</em> by Mortimer V-P at [53], and by
                    Eames J in <em>Hoser</em> at [228] – the court
                    must consider what would happen if the impugned publication was left unchecked.
                    Third, the authority and credibility which the publication possess, or claims to
                    possess: see <em>eg Wain</em> at [61] to [62] (article in a
                    financial paper of international repute, written by the president of a major
                    news organisation), and <em>Hoser</em> at [218] (alleged
                    contemnor set himself up to be a person of eminence in the investigation of
                    corruption). Finally, there is the fact that judges in Singapore are the sole
                    arbiters of fact and law in cases coming before the courts (<em>Wain</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Thirdly, I would reiterate the law is not
                    concerned with the effect of the impugned publication on the judge hearing the
                    application to commit; it looks to the potential effect on public confidence in
                    the administration of justice. If a judge finds that an impugned publication
                    poses a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of
                    justice, the publication is <em>prima facie</em> in
                    contempt even though the judge might personally take a more liberal view of its
                    contents. If a judge finds that the impugned publication does not pose any real
                    risk of undermining public confidence, he must decline to commit, even though he
                    is personally outraged by the contents. Similarly, the law is not concerned with
                    the subjective intentions or opinions of the author. The issue at all times is
                    the actual or potential effect on public confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Fourthly, the requirement for a real risk,
                    while very wide, is not illusory. One example is the hypothetical found in
                        <em>Hertzberg</em>: if rants made at a dinner party are
                    shown to have been ignored, I cannot see that they would pose a real risk to
                    public confidence in the administration of justice. Another illustration can be
                    found in the facts of <em>Ex p A-G; Re Goodwin</em> (1969)
                    70 SR (NSW) 413, where a letter circulated by a disappointed litigant to the
                    Attorney-General of New South Wales and 13 Registrars of the district courts was
                    found to be in contempt. I am in no position to assess the situation in
                    Australia or New South Wales. But I am very certain that, should the same letter
                    be circulated to the Attorney-General, or the Registry of the Supreme Court or
                    the subordinate courts, it will not pose the slightest risk of undermining
                    public confidence in the administration of justice. In fact, I should say from
                    personal experience that such letters are not infrequently received by the
                    Registry of the Supreme Court, and copied to holders of high public office such
                    as the Attorney-General, ministers, and permanent secretaries, but the
                    Attorney-General has not, quite correctly in my view, seen fit to take action
                    against them in the law of contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mens rea</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     There was no dispute that the only <em>mens rea</em> which is needed at common law is that the
                    publication is intentional; and that it is not necessary to prove an intention
                    to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. If authority is
                    needed it can be found in <em>Radio Avon</em> at
                    232–234; <em>Ahnee</em> at 307; <em>A-G New South Wales v Mundey</em> [1972] 2 NSWLR 887 at
                    911–2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Constitutional considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Ravi also argued that Article 14 of
                    the Constitution compels me to adopt the “real risk” test. Article
                    14 provides in material part as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Freedom of speech, assembly and
                            association</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14. —(1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3) —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and
                        expression;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Parliament may by law impose —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) on the rights conferred by clause (1) (<em>a</em>), such restrictions as it considers necessary or
                            expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part
                            thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or
                            morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of
                            Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or
                            incitement to any offence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Article 14 does not define contempt, and
                    neither does Parliament – s 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) merely provides for the power of the High Court
                    and the Court of Appeal to punish for contempt, and does not define the offence.
                    The offence therefore falls, by necessary implication, to be defined by the
                    courts. But that does not mean that the courts – or Parliament, should it
                    take up the issue – have unlimited scope in defining the offence. They
                    must do so consistently with the words, structure and spirit of Article 14,
                    which clearly demand some kind of balance to be struck between the freedom of
                    speech, which is the rule, and the offence of contempt, an exception to the
                    rule. At the very minimum, neither can be defined in such a way that renders the
                    other otiose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     With respect, despite some references to
                    constitutional authorities in other jurisdictions, Mr Ravi did not
                    distinctly address me on how Article 14 compels the adoption of the real risk
                    test. In the absence of properly focussed argument, and also in the light of the
                    fact that I have concluded that the real risk test urged by Mr Ravi should
                    be adopted at common law, I must decline to enter into constitutional
                    exposition. It is sufficient for me to note that Mr Ravi has not argued
                    that an offence of scandalising the court is inherently unconstitutional, and
                    that the majority of cases have concluded that the real risk test, coupled with
                    a right of fair criticism, constitutes a reasonable limit on the freedom of
                    speech and expression: see <em>Wong Yeung Ng</em>,
                        <em>per</em> Mortimer V-P at [32]–[59]; <em>per</em> Mayo JA at [79]–[97]; <em>per</em> Leong JA at [107]–[117]; <em>Ahnee</em> at 305–306; <em>S-G v
                        Smith</em> [2004] 2 NZLR 540 at 568; and <em>Nationwide News Proprietary Ltd v Wills</em> (1992)
                    177 CLR 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I now consider the available defences.
                    Ms Subramanian took the position that the defences in defamation of
                    justification and fair comment are not available in contempt, relying in this
                    regard on <em>Wain, Chee Soon Juan</em> and <em>Hertzberg</em>. She submitted that fair criticism was the
                    only available defence. As for Mr Ravi, he appeared at some points to
                    suggest that the impugned statements in the book were justified. In his final
                    set of written submissions, however, he acknowledged that justification was not
                    an available defence to scandalising the court and that the relevant defence was
                    that of fair criticism. However, Mr Ravi did argue that fair criticism was
                    a broader defence than justification. He also argued that the rejection of fair
                    comment as a defence was merely semantic given the acceptance of fair criticism,
                    implying that both defences are similar. In the circumstances, it is just as
                    well that I examine the defences of justification, fair comment, and fair
                    criticism, bearing in mind that, even at common law, the protection of public
                    confidence in the administration of justice has to be balanced against the
                    freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     
          <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>
                    held that the defences of justification and fair comment in the law of
                    defamation were not available in the law of contempt for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    It is imperative that the integrity of our judges
                            is not impugned without cause. The overriding interest in protecting the
                            public's confidence in the administration of justice necessitates a
                            rejection of the defences at law for defamation, particularly where
                            accusations against a judge's impartiality are mounted. In the words of
                            the authors of <em>Borrie &amp; Lowe</em> ([21]
                            supra) at p 351, "[a]llegations of partiality are treated seriously
                            because they tend to undermine confidence in the basic function of a
                            judge" [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    Allowing the defence of fair comment would expose
                            the integrity of the courts to unwarranted attacks, bearing in mind that
                            a belief published in good faith and not for an ulterior motive can
                            amount to "fair comment" even though the belief in question was not
                            reasonable (see <em>Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd</em>
                            [1968] 2 QB 157). Singapore judges do not have the habit of
                            issuing public statements to defend themselves (as some UK judges have
                            been prone to do). Our judges feel constrained by their position not to
                            react to criticism and have no official forum in which they can respond.
                            That does not mean that they can be attacked with
                        impunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    In a similar vein, admitting the defence of
                            justification would, in effect, allow the court hearing the allegation
                            of contempt to "sit to try the conduct of the Judge": (see <em>Attorney-General v Blomfield</em> (1914)
                            33 NZLR 545 at 563). Recognising the defence of justification
                            would give malicious parties an added opportunity to subject the dignity
                            of the courts to more bouts of attacks; that is
                        unacceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    There are more appropriate channels through which
                            genuine concerns regarding the Judiciary can be ventilated. The
                            Constitution has, by way of Art 98, established a means of recourse to
                            deal with judges undeserving of their office. The proper course for
                            anyone who believes that he has evidence of judicial corruption or lack
                            of impartiality is to submit it to the proper authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>Hertzberg</em>,
                    the court likewise distinguished defamation and contempt:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    One should be circumspect about drawing parallels
                            between the law of contempt (especially that relating to the offence of
                            "scandalising the court") and the law of defamation. Both impose
                            restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression. For the
                            conflict between defamation and the right to freedom of speech and
                            expression, see Doris Chia and Rueben Mathiavaranam, <em>Evans on Defamation in Singapore and Malaysia</em>
                            (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2008) ("<em>Evans on
                                Defamation</em>") at p 1. "Scurrilous" allegations made
                            against judges (which fall within the ambit of “scandalising the
                            court") may be both contemptuous and defamatory (of the individual
                            judge) (see <em>Contempt of Court</em> ([19] supra)
                            at para 12.06). As noted by the learned author of <em>Contempt of Court</em>, the points of similarity between the
                            law of defamation and "scandalising the court" prompt one to inquire
                            whether the defences one associates with defamation, such as
                            justification and fair comment, are similarly available in a case of
                            contempt (at para 12.31). In my view, it is clear that parallels should
                            not be drawn between the two branches of law despite the similarities
                            that they seem to share, given that they exist essentially for different
                            purposes; the law of contempt (as already seen above) is concerned with
                            the protection of the administration of justice and is grounded in
                            public interest but the law of defamation is concerned with the
                            protection of a private individual's reputation (see generally Patrick
                            Milmo QC and WVH Rogers (gen eds), <em>Gatley on Libel
                                and Slander</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2004) at para
                            1.1 and <em>Evans on Defamation</em> at p 1). I
                            agree with both T S Sinnathuray J ("Sinnathuray J") and Lai Siu
                            Chiu J ("Lai J") that defences in defamation have no application in
                            the realm of contempt of court (see Wain ([13] supra) at [55]-[60] and
                                <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> ([17] supra) at
                            [44]-[47])...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court went on to cite the passages in <em>Chee
                        Soon Juan</em> quoted above, and concluded that “[t]he law of
                    defamation and the law of contempt are distinct in principle and in purpose.
                    They should not be regarded as though they were one and the
                same.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The applicability of justification and fair
                    comment has also been considered by other jurisdictions. In <em>A-G v Blomfield</em> (1914) 33 NZLR 545, relied upon by
                    Lai J in <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>, Williams J held
                    at 563 that “[t]he court does not sit to try the conduct of the
                    Judge.” However, in the later decision of <em>Radio
                        Avon</em>, the New Zealand Court of Appeal alluded to the possibility
                    of applying the defences of justification and fair comment, without reaching a
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>R v Nicholls</em>
                    (1911) 12 CLR 280, Griffith CJ, delivering the judgment of the High
                    Court of Australia, stated at 286 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am not prepared to accede to the proposition that an imputation of want
                        of impartiality to a Judge is necessarily a contempt of Court. On the
                        contrary, I think that, if any Judge of this Court or of any other Court
                        were to make a public utterance of such character as to be likely to impair
                        the confidence of the public, or of suitors or any class of suitors in the
                        impartiality of the Court in any matter likely to be brought before it, any
                        public comment on such an utterance, if it were a fair comment, would, so
                        far from being a contempt of Court, be for the public benefit, and would be
                        entitled to similar protection to that which comment upon matters of public
                        interest is entitled under the law of libel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Nationwide News Pty Ltd
                        v Wills</em>, Mason CJ said at [12] of his judgment that “[s]o
                    long as the defendant is genuinely exercising a right of criticism and not
                    acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice, he
                    or she is immune.” Likewise, Brennan J said at [5] of his judgment
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not necessary, even if it be possible, to chart the limits of
                        contempt scandalizing the court. It is sufficient to say that the revelation
                        of truth – at all events when its revelation is for the public benefit
                        – and the making of a fair criticism based on fact do not amount to a
                        contempt of court though the truth revealed or the criticism made is such as
                        to deprive the court or judge of public confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>Ahnee</em> at 306,
                    the Privy Council rejected the notion that an imputation of bias is necessarily
                    contemptuous, and agreed with the suggestion in <em>R v
                        Nicholls</em> that there might be a defence analogous to fair comment
                    in such situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The classic illustration of such an offence [<em>ie</em> scandalising the court] is the imputation of improper
                        motives to a judge. But, so far as <em>Ambard's</em>
                        case [1936] A.C. 322 may suggest that such conduct must invariably be an
                        offence their Lordships consider that such an absolute statement is not
                        nowadays acceptable. For example, if a judge descends into the arena and
                        embarks on extensive and plainly biased questioning of a defendant in a
                        criminal trial, a criticism of bias may not be an offence. The exposure and
                        criticism of such judicial misconduct would be in the public interest. On
                        this point their Lordships prefer the view of the Australian courts that
                        such conduct is not necessarily an offence: <em>Rex v.
                            Nicholls</em> (1911) 12 C.L.R. 280.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the United Kingdom, the Committee on
                    Contempt of Court, chaired by Phillimore LJ, considered in its Report (Cmnd
                    5794) (HMSO, 1997) that justification should be a defence when it is for the
                    public benefit:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We considered whether ... it should be a sufficient defence merely to
                        prove that the allegation was true. In view of the special constitutional
                        position of courts and judges, we do not think that a criminal trial is the
                        right way of testing this issue. A defence of truth may or may not be
                        advanced in good faith; an allegation of bias, for example, may follow a
                        long and responsible investigation or it may be generalised or malicious
                        invective on the part of somebody who has lost his case. The latter is
                        usually not doubt, best ignored but if, in an extreme case, a prosecution
                        were brought and such a defence put forward its effect would simply be to
                        give the defendant a further and public platform for the wide publication of
                        his assertions or allegations, which might be wholly without foundation. An
                        allegation of bias in relation to a particular case might, if the defendant
                        were permitted to plead justification, be used in effect as a means of
                        getting a case reheard. Finally, a simple defence of truth would permit the
                        malicious and irresponsible publication of some damaging episode from a
                        judge’s past, however distant, calculated to cast doubt upon his
                        rightness to try a particular case or class of cases. We therefore do not
                        consider that truth alone should be a defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We think, however, that if, in addition to proving the truth of his
                        allegation, a defendant can show that its publication was for the public
                        benefit he should be entitled to an acquittal. We are very much alive to the
                        juridical difficulties of such a defence, but the present context, in our
                        view, justifies its creation and there is a precedent for it in the closely
                        analogous law of criminal libel in England and Wales. We would, however, add
                        an important proviso. In our view, the proper course for anyone to take who
                        believes that he has evidence of judicial corruption or lack of impartiality
                        is to submit it to the proper authority, namely, the Lord Chancellor or the
                        Secretary of State for Scotland, as the case may be. It is they who have the
                        power of removal of judicial officers below the High Court level if they
                        misbehave, and they are the appropriate recipients for complaints as to the
                        conduct of High Court Judges. It is hard to conceive how it could be held to
                        be for the public benefit to publish allegations imputing improper motives
                        to those taking part in the administration of justice if the defendant had
                        taken no steps to report the matter to the proper authority, or to enable
                        that authority to deal with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I cannot accept, as a matter of basic
                    principle, that a court would regard as contemptuous a statement of fact which
                    is true; in fact, I would say that it is very much in the public interest that
                    judicial impropriety should be brought to light. At the same time, I see
                    considerable force in the Phillimore Committee’s argument that an
                    application for committal is not the right place to try an allegation of
                    judicial error or impropriety, and that recognising a bare defence of
                    justification would allow <em>mala fide</em> defendants a
                    further and public forum to repeat their contempt. In particular, such
                    defendants may engage in vexatious and abusive attempts to subpoena witnesses or
                    obtain discovery in order to justify their contempt after the fact. I do not
                    see, however, how the possibility of such abuses is addressed by imposing an
                    additional requirement of public benefit, as proposed by the Phillimore
                    Committee and suggested in the Australian cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I also cannot agree with the suggestion made
                    by the Phillimore Committee and <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>,
                    and taken up by Ms Subramanian, that all discussions of judicial wrongdoing
                    must be directed to the Prime Minister or the Chief Justice, with the aim of
                    activating the removal mechanism provided for in Article 98(3) of the
                    Constitution. The public must be able to debate judicial conduct without seising
                    the removal mechanism in Article 98(3). Indeed, frequent resort to the
                    extraordinary mechanism in Article 98(3) cannot be healthy for the independence
                    of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As for fair comment, I agree with <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> and <em>Hertzberg</em> that the defence cannot be directly imported into
                    contempt. The defence of fair comment balances the public interest in
                    unrestricted discussion on matters of public importance and the private interest
                    of the defamed person in his or her reputation. By contrast, in the offence of
                    scandalising the court, the interest countervailing to free speech, as indicated
                    by the majority in <em>Gallagher v Durack</em> at 243, is
                    quite different:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law endeavours to reconcile two principles, each of which is of
                        cardinal importance, but which, in some circumstances, appear to come in
                        conflict. One principle is that speech should be free, so that everyone has
                        the right to comment in good faith on matters of public importance,
                        including the administration of justice, even if the comment is outspoken,
                        mistaken or wrong-headed. The other principle is that "it is necessary for
                        the purpose of maintaining public confidence in the administration of law
                        that there shall be some certain and immediate method of repressing
                        imputations upon courts of justice which, if continued, are likely to impair
                        their authority”...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the light of this difference in underlying rationales, it would be
                    inappropriate to import wholesale the defence of fair comment into the law of
                    contempt. That said, it may well be that there is in the final analysis some
                    functional similarity between fair comment and fair criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I turn now to fair criticism. The law in this
                    regard has been ably addressed by Prakash J in <em>Tan Liang
                        Joo</em>. Prakash J accepted at [14] that “[f]air
                    criticism does not amount to contempt of court”, approving in this regard
                    Lord Atkin’s speech in <em>Ambard</em> at 335
                    (Prakash J referred to the All England Reports). Prakash J went on to
                    elaborate the ambit of fair criticism as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    It is apparent from Lord Atkin's reasoning,
                            however, that there are limits to the right of fair criticism. The
                            criticism must be made in good faith and must also be respectful. In
                            determining whether <em>mala fides</em> has been
                            proved, the court can take into account a wide range of
                        factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    One relevant factor is the extent to which the
                            allegedly fair criticism is supported by argument and evidence. There
                            must be some reason or basis for the criticism or else it would amount
                            to an unsupported attack on the court...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    Another relevant factor is the manner in which the
                            alleged criticism is made. The criticism must generally be expressed in
                            a temperate and dispassionate manner, since an intention to vilify the
                            courts is easily inferred where outrageous and abusive language is used
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Such temperate, balanced criticism allows for
                            rational debate about the issues raised and thus may even contribute to
                            the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice.
                            Scurrilous and preposterous attacks, on the other hand, are likely to
                            have the opposite effect...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    Apart from the two factors discussed above, courts
                            have also taken into consideration such factors as the party's attitude
                            in court (see, for example, <em>R v Vidal</em> The
                            Times (14 October 1922), cited in <em>Borrie &amp;
                                Lowe</em> ([18] <em>supra</em>) at p 349
                            n 15) and the number of instances of contemning conduct (see, for
                            example, <em>Regina v Glanzer</em> (1963)
                            38 DLR (2d) 402). The list of relevant factors is not closed.
                            The court is entitled to take into account all the circumstances of the
                            case which in its view go towards showing bad faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am in complete agreement with the above passages. Prakash J
                    then referred to and criticised the apparent English position that the acts or
                    words in question must not impute improper motives to or impugn the integrity,
                    propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    There is another,
                            more contentious, limit on the right of criticism. It appears from the
                            English authorities above that the act or words in question must not
                            impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and
                            impartiality of judges or the courts (see, for example, Ambard ([14]
                            supra); <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> ([18]
                            supra); see also <em>Borrie &amp; Lowe</em> at pp
                            350-352). The rationale for this second limit is explained in <em>Borrie &amp; Lowe</em> as follows (at pp
                            350-351):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The courts are particularly sensitive to allegations of partiality, it
                            being a basic function of a judge to make an impartial judgment. The law
                            goes to some lengths to ensure that a judge has no personal interest in
                            the case, his decision being considered void and of no effect if bias is
                            proved: nemo judex in sua causa. Allegations of partiality are treated
                            seriously because they tend to undermine confidence in the basic
                            function of a judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    The need to maintain
                            public confidence in the administration of justice must, however, be
                            balanced against the public interest in rooting out bias and impropriety
                            where it in fact occurs. We ought not to be so complacent as to assume
                            that judges and courts are infallible or impervious to human sentiment.
                            Thus, I have some sympathy for the view expressed in the New Zealand
                            case of <em>Solicitor-General v Radio Avon Ltd</em>
                            [1978] 1 NZLR 225 (at 231):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If this were the law [that allegations of improper motives, bias or
                            impropriety could not constitute fair criticism] then nobody could
                            publish a true account of the conduct of a judge if the matter published
                            disclosed that the judge had in fact acted from some improper motive.
                            Nor would it be possible, on the basis of facts truly stated, to make an
                            honest and fair comment suggesting some improper motive, such as
                            partiality or bias, without running the risk of being held in
                            contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    The fear of baseless imputations of bias or
                            impropriety is unfounded as the court is able to take into account
                            factors such as the existence of evidence for such allegations under the
                            requirement of <em>bona fides</em>. To my mind,
                            therefore, the second limit on the right to criticise is unnecessary and
                            potentially overly restrictive of legitimate criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In this last regard, <em>Tan
                        Liang Joo</em> is at odds with <em>Hertzberg</em>, which took the position at [54] that criticism directed
                    at the impartiality of the courts or which imputes improper motives to the
                    judges can never constitute fair criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I would elaborate on the defence of fair
                    criticism as follows. First, there should be some objective basis, whether in
                    fact or in argument, for the allegation made. Unless it is founded on notorious
                    facts, the objective basis must be stated together with the criticism, so that
                    those who view the publication can evaluate its merits. It is not necessary to
                    establish an unassailable basis for the criticism made against it or even a
                    basis which is objectively more reasonable than not. The reason, and I should
                    emphasise this, is because a court, in deciding whether the defence of fair
                    criticism is made out, is <em>not</em> required or
                    concerned to determine whether the criticism was proved or disproved as a fact.
                    In my view, it is sufficient for the defendant to give some rational basis for
                    the criticisms he makes. However, the cogency of the rational basis required to
                    support the allegation would increase correspondingly with the seriousness of
                    the allegation made. This is consistent with the approach in other areas of law,
                        <em>eg</em> the proving of an allegation of fraud or
                    dishonesty in civil cases. It is further justified by the fact that, the more
                    serious the allegation made, the greater the risk it poses to public confidence
                    in the administration of justice, all other things being equal. The seriousness
                    of the allegation would depend on its contents, the most serious being those
                    allegations which strike at the core of the judicial duty: the impartial
                    administration of justice without fear or favour. The seriousness of the
                    criticism also depends on the authority which the critic possesses or claims to
                    possess – if a critic puts himself forward as an expert, or having done
                    exhaustive research, and so on, in criticising the court, he will, quite
                    naturally, be held to the higher standard which he has claimed. For example, a
                    financial paper of international repute (<em>Wain</em>), or
                    a person who claims to be an eminent investigator of corruption (<em>Hoser</em>), would be expected to supply a correspondingly
                    cogent basis for the criticisms which they make. At the same time, it must be
                    remembered that what is needed at the end of the day is not proof of the
                    criticism, merely some rational basis for it. A censorious attitude must be
                    eschewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Second, the allegation should be made in good
                    faith. This means that the person must genuinely believe in the truth of the
                    criticism he made. There is no public interest in protecting criticism which the
                    defendant knew or believed to be false at the time of making it. Likewise if the
                    defendant acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsehood of his criticism.
                    A key consideration in assessing good faith, so defined, is whether the
                    publication presented such a selective, distorted or patently false view of the
                    facts that it goes beyond wrong-headedness and evinces a reckless disregard of
                    the truth, or even outright dishonesty. An essential part of good faith, so
                    defined, is that the rational basis cited in defence of a criticism against the
                    court must be known to the defendant when the criticism is made. This means that
                    the defendant who seeks to establish a factual basis for his criticism only
                    during the application for committal does so in vain – if he does not know
                    the basis for making the criticism when he made it, then he would have been
                    acting in bad faith, in which case the defence of fair criticism would not avail
                    him. Separately, if the defendant is shown to have acted in good faith, in the
                    sense of having a genuine belief in the truth of the criticism he makes, then
                    his purpose in making the criticism will not matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I pause here to note that the first two
                    requirements mean that a person in possession of facts supporting his criticism
                    and who genuinely believes in the truth of his criticism will be able to raise a
                    defence to contempt. This substantially obviates the need for justification as a
                    defence and, in the light of the difficulties associated with such a defence, I
                    agree entirely with the earlier decisions of our courts which declined to
                    recognise it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Third, the requirement for respectfulness must
                    be tempered by the realisation that the law in this area applies to everyone and
                    not just those who are bound by the rules of court decorum. The man in the
                    street is as entitled to criticise the courts as the learned professors in the
                    universities, and it would not be reasonable to expect every person to adopt the
                    refined language of scholarly discourse or court address. In my view, the court
                    should not penalise criticism which, though expressed (to use Lord Atkin’s
                    term) in outspoken language, is otherwise made in good faith and has some
                    objective basis in fact or reason. However, abusive, intemperate or outrageous
                    language should be eschewed, not least because an escalation of the language
                    used in criticism may convey a more serious criticism, for which a more cogent
                    basis would be required. It is, for example, one thing to say that a judge has
                    handed down a harsh and oppressive sentence without regard to sentencing
                    precedents, and quite another to say that he was actually biased against the
                    accused. Also, to the extent that trenchant criticisms are made without some
                    rational basis, they may for that reason fall outside of fair
                criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Fourth, I am in agreement with the tentative
                    view in <em>Tan Liang Joo</em> that there should no limit
                    to the kind of criticisms which can be made against the court subject to the
                    above three criteria being met. I should specifically say that, while
                    allegations of partiality and corruption are gravely insulting to judges, for
                    they strike at the very core of the court’s constitutional duty, there is
                    no reason in principle why a person who genuinely believes that the court is
                    partial and corrupt and has a rational basis for this belief should not be able
                    to say so without fear of being held in contempt. An example is given in
                        <em>Ahnee</em> of a judge who engages in patently
                    biased questioning of witnesses. In fact, there is a powerful public interest,
                    which has been applied time and again in Singapore, of exposing and rooting out
                    impropriety and corruption on the part of those who hold public office, wherever
                    or whoever they may be. In the judicial context, V K Rajah JA has recently
                    declared that “[a] culture of openness has long since taken firm root in
                    our courts, with mistakes being acknowledged openly rather than being papered
                    over”: <em>Tan Lai Kiat v PP</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 1042 at [63]. And, as Prakash J opined in <em>Tan Liang Joo</em>, we cannot be so complacent as to assume
                    that judges would be infallible or impervious to human sentiment. At the same
                    time, it should be emphasised that, the more serious the criticism made, the
                    more cogent must be the arguments and facts cited in support of
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on the law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In summary, under the law as I understand it,
                    the public and constitutional interest in ensuring public confidence in the
                    administration of justice is given robust protection. All publications posing
                    real risks of undermining public confidence are <em>prima
                        facie</em> in contempt of court. Only <em>de
                        minimis</em>, remote and fanciful risks are excluded. Any greater
                    risk, including that of a “small likelihood”, is caught, although
                    if the risk is not great there might be a light sentence or none at all. At the
                    same time, there is a defence of fair criticism, in the terms which I have set
                    out. Any risk posed to public confidence as a result of fair criticism is
                    justified. It is only in the extreme situation, where a person criticises
                    without any rational basis, or without genuine belief in the truth of his
                    criticism, that he will be caught by the law of contempt. In the light of the
                    importance of ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice, this
                    can hardly be considered an excessive restriction of the freedom of speech. I
                    recognise that the burden would lie on the defendant to show that he was acting
                    within his right of fair criticism. But it is unlikely that cases in this area
                    would turn on the burden of proof, and in the event that they do the benefit of
                    the doubt will of course be given to the defendant. In any case, the ingredients
                    of the defence of fair criticism are in their nature matters within the
                    knowledge of the defendant, who is therefore not unduly burdened in exercising
                    his right to free speech. In my view, this approach strikes an adequate balance
                    between the freedom of speech and the countervailing constitutional interest in
                    ensuring that public confidence in the administration of justice does not falter
                    as a result of scandalous publications. The court, for its part, is not required
                    to pass on the truth or falsehood of the criticism levelled against it. A
                    finding that fair criticism applies simply vindicates the respondent’s
                    right of free speech.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I turn now to the facts. The application for
                    committal reads in material part:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That Alan Shadrake, the author of the book “Once a Jolly Hangman:
                        Singapore justice in the dock” (the “Book”) do stand
                        committed to prison or receive such other punishment as the court may impose
                        for his contempt of court by his acts in connection with the bringing into
                        existence, publication and distribution of the Book which contains passages
                        that scandalise the Singapore Judiciary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The O 52 r 2(2) statement states in material part:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The grounds on which the said relief [of committal] are sought are that
                        the said Respondent has participated in acts in connection with the bringing
                        into existence, publication and distribution of the Book which contained
                        passages that scandalise the Singapore Judiciary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Book is about the administration of the death penalty in
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Book contains passages which undermine the authority of the Singapore
                        courts and public confidence in the administration of justice in Singapore.
                        Without being exhaustive, this Statement sets out the passages which contain
                        imputations against the independence and integrity of the Singapore
                        Judiciary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It then refers to 14 statements from the book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Mr Ravi objected to the
                    Attorney-General’s caveats in using the words “without being
                    exhaustive” and “including” when referring to the 14
                    statements). I agree: the O 52 r 2(2) statement is exhaustive, by virtue of
                    O 52 r 5(3), unless the court gives leave otherwise. Ms Subramanian
                    quite rightly confirmed that the Attorney-General was only proceeding on the 14
                    statements in its O 52 r 2(2) statement. But it is of course permissible to have
                    regard to the statements in the context of the book, and indeed both parties
                    provided the court with a copy of the book and situated their arguments in the
                    context of the book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The O 52 r 2(2) statement also referred to the
                    affidavit of Ms Kumarassamy Gunavathy, a senior analyst with the Media
                    Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     When this matter first came up for hearing on
                    30 July 2010, Mr Shadrake applied and was given leave to file an affidavit
                    in reply. Mr Ravi also asked for leave to file affidavits by third parties.
                    At that time, Mr Ravi could not specify who they were, but suggested
                    tentatively that they could include the German government, the International Bar
                    Association and “other agencies”. I ruled that Mr Ravi could
                    apply for leave when he ascertained the third parties who were prepared to file
                    affidavits on behalf of Mr Shadrake. Mr Shadrake filed an affidavit on
                    13 August, but his responses were not referenced properly to the 14 statements
                    impugned by the Attorney-General and there was no response to one of the 14
                    statements. This was pointed out at a pre-trial conference on 25 August. I gave
                    Mr Shadrake leave to amend and re-file his affidavit. I also asked
                    Mr Ravi if Mr Shadrake wished to adduce any other affidavit evidence.
                    Mr Ravi said no. I also asked parties to inform me whether there would be
                    cross-examination at the next pre-trial conference, on 21 September. There
                    Ms Subramanian indicated that the Attorney-General did not require any
                    cross-examination. Mr Ravi informed me that he was undecided, but
                    eventually confirmed by a letter dated 01 October 2010 that he would not be
                    applying to cross-examine the Attorney-General’s deponents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     When the application was finally heard,
                    Mr Shadrake did not choose to exercise his right under O 52 r 5(4) to give
                    oral evidence on his own behalf. As such, the hearing proceeded on the basis of
                    the affidavits filed by both sides.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I turn now to examine the facts. I will first
                    lay down the context as regards the publication and availability of the book and
                    Mr Shadrake’s claims of being an investigative journalist. I will
                    then individually examine the 14 statements impugned by the Attorney-General to
                    determine whether they were made with rational bases and/or in good faith so as
                    to constitute fair criticism. I will then determine whether some or all of the
                    14 statements, contextually considered, pose a real risk to public confidence in
                    the administration of justice, and, if so, whether Mr Shadrake is entitled
                    to claim fair criticism in respect of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Context</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Ms Gunavathy deposed that she bought two
                    copies of the book from Kinokuniya Book Store of Singapore Pte Ltd at the
                    Takashimaya shopping centre in Ngee Ann City. She verily believes that the book
                    has been sold in Singapore by several bookstores, including Kinokuniya Book
                    Store of Singapore Pte Ltd, Select Books Pte Ltd and Mary Martin Book Sellers
                    Pte Ltd. As Mr Ravi stated that cross-examination was not necessary, the
                    contents Ms Gunavathy’s affidavit must be taken as accepted.
                    Mr Ravi further informed the court that almost 6,000 copies of the book
                    have been sold internationally, especially at airports, and that some copies are
                    being circulated in Singapore. On these bases, I am satisfied that the book has
                    a not insignificant range of distribution. Also, Mr Shadrake’s
                    authorship of the book is not disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Shadrake has held himself out as an
                    investigative journalist. For example, in the preface to the book,
                    Mr Shadrake wrote as follows at pp vii-viii:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... An interview with Singapore’s hangman who had been chief
                        executioner for almost 50 years since colonial days was on my mind. It was a
                        daunting task. But after months of relentless sleuthing I managed to find
                        the man who had hanged an estimated 1,000 men and women mainly for murder
                        and drug trafficking – and surprisingly get him to talk. I<em>t led to a meticulous search of legal files and archived cases
                            going back to 1963 while interviewing abolitionists and lawyers involved
                            in many sensational cases that went largely under-reported or not
                            reported at all</em>. The result is a unique glimpse into the
                        deadly career of arguably the most prolific executioner in the world –
                        a man who believes he has helped keep Singapore one of the safest places in
                        the world. And something else. Something sinister: how the Singapore legal
                        system works in secret and how politics, international trade and business
                        often determine who lives and who dies on the gallows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Shadrake then refers to his sources, which according to him
                    include unnamed lawyers, two unnamed officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau,
                    and an anonymous librarian who helped him delve into archived records at the
                    National Library. It is therefore plain from all this that Mr Shadrake is
                    putting the book forward as a product of his investigative journalism, and
                    indeed he describes himself as an investigative journalist with a long career at
                    p 21 of the book. At p 26, he says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wanted to expose some of the ghastly secrets of the gallows – the
                        kind of secrets Singapore’s leaders are so proud of, revere, put so
                        much faith in but don’t want anyone else to know about. Capital
                        punishment in the tiny state had for far too long been shrouded in this kind
                        of secrecy and discussion on the subject completely discouraged. It was time
                        something was done about it in as dramatic a way as possible, I thought to
                        myself. Could I be the one to expose the un-exposable? It would not be the
                        first time I had rattled a few cages in high places with an equally
                        embarrassing expose ... But being trained in journalism in the
                        ‘publish and be damned’ way, I was determined to go ahead come
                        what may.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Also, anyone who picks up the book will readily see on the back cover
                    of the book the following description:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Over the past few decades, investigative journalism has come to mean the
                        kind of brave reporting that exposes injustice, wrongdoing and, above all,
                        the abuse of power. Alan Shadrake’s hard hitting new book cuts through
                        the façade of official silence to reveal disturbing truths about
                        Singapore’s use of the death penalty. From in-depth interviews with
                        Darshan Singh, Singapore’s chief executioner for nearly fifty years,
                        to meticulously researched accounts of numerous high profile cases,
                            <b>Once A Jolly Hangman</b> reveals the cruelty
                        and imprudence of an entire judicial system. At the same time he displays a
                        touching empathy with the anguish of the victims and their families. This
                        important book should be required reading for human rights activists
                        everywhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and a bibliographical note:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Alan Shadrake</b> is a renowned veteran
                        investigative journalist and author whose 50-year career has taken him
                        around the world. His first major book <b>The Yellow
                            Pimpernels</b> told the escape stories across the Berlin Wall and
                        was the subject of a BBC documentary. Subsequent publications have delved
                        into a variety of subjects including an expose of life in a Soviet gulag,
                        the story of the boy poisoner Graham Young and, with Linda Lee, <b>The Life and Tragic Death of Bruce Lee</b>. His appetite
                        for unearthing the facts and presenting unpalatable truths remains
                        undiminished. He divides his time between Britain and Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The statements made in the book must therefore be scrutinised in this
                    light. Mr Ravi had argued that Mr Shadrake should be held to the
                    standard of a layperson. This is misconceived. The statements should be read, as
                    they would be read by members of the public, as coming from a person who has
                    held himself out to be an investigative journalist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In this regard, I see as rather telling the
                    fact that, notwithstanding Mr Shadrake’s claims of being an
                    investigative journalist who embarked on a “meticulous search of legal
                    files and archived cases going back to 1963 while interviewing abolitionists and
                    lawyers involved in many sensational cases that went largely under-reported or
                    not reported at all”, he did not produce any evidence of his
                    investigations during the hearing. The documentary evidence he annexed to his
                    affidavit comprised:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     excerpts from the autobiography of

                        wrote his book;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_e"></a>(e)     a transcript of the audio recording of an interview he did with
                        Mr Subhas Anandan on Vignes Mourthi’s case (discussed below);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_f"></a>(f)     the July
                        2008 report of the Human Rights Institute of the International Bar
                        Association, entitled “Prosperity versus individual rights? Human
                        rights, democracy and the rule of law in Singapore” (“the IBA
                        report”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">His affidavit does not refer to any
                    other material. For example, for the 1<sup>st</sup> statement,
                    he says: “In coming to this conclusion I relied on the information in the
                    book written by Singapore’s top criminal lawyer Mr Subhas
                    Anandan.” For the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement, he says:
                    “The evidence I relied upon can again be found in Mr Anandan’s
                    book.” Such was the extent, or rather the limit, of the evidence of his
                    investigative journalism that he produced to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 1<sup>st</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I turn now to the statements. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> statement, at p viii of the book,
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Something sinister: how the Singapore legal system works in secret and how
                        politics, international trade and business often determine who lives and who
                        dies on the gallows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Shadrake argued in his affidavit that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> statement is meant to refer to the abuse of
                    prosecutorial discretion, and that it could not have been directed at the
                    courts, which in the cases he discusses are bound by the mandatory death
                    penalty. Mr Ravi submitted further that “legal system” is not
                    meant to include the judiciary, but refers to the prosecution, the legislature
                    and the executive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I cannot accept these explanations. I cannot
                    see how “legal system” can be naturally read to include everything
                    but the courts. The plain and ordinary meaning of “system” is
                    something which comprises several components or parts that make up an organised
                    whole. One does not, when referring to a system, mean everything but one of its
                    components. If anything. the courts are the first thing that comes to mind when
                    a reference is made to a country’s legal system. I am also unable to
                    accept that courts have no role to play when faced with persons accused of
                    crimes which carry the mandatory death penalty. The courts do not impose the
                    death penalty at the instance of the prosecution; they do so after being
                    satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused person according
                    to law. Therefore, in making the first statement, Mr Shadrake is clearly
                    accusing the courts (as well as other parts of the legal system) of taking
                    politics, international trade and business into account in determining who lives
                    and who dies on the gallows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2<sup>nd</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The 2<sup>nd</sup> statement,
                    at p 3 of the book, refers to the case of Julia Bohl, a German national who was
                    arrested and initially charged with the capital offence of trafficking more than
                    500 grams of cannabis, which was subsequently reduced to a non-capital offence
                    of trafficking in a smaller amount:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shortly before a young German woman, known to have been running a
                        lucrative drugs ring in Singapore, was sentenced to only five years, of
                        which she served three for good behaviour – a slap on the wrist which
                        was arranged by the Singapore government under the threat of economic
                        reprisals by the German government.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 2<sup>nd</sup> statement alleges that the
                    Singapore government arranged for a light sentence (“<em>only</em> five years”) for a <em>known</em> drug trafficker, who was “running a lucrative drugs
                    ring in Singapore”, under threat of economic reprisals by the home
                    government of the trafficker. Mr Shadrake sought to present the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> statement as a criticism of the prosecution
                    for succumbing to diplomatic pressure. This is plainly untenable given his
                    reference to the fact that the sentence of “only five years” was a
                    “slap on the wrist arranged by the Singapore government”.
                    Sentencing is generally and in this case the province of the courts, and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> statement clearly alleges that the sentence
                    of Bohl by the courts was procured by the Singapore government under the threat
                    of economic reprisals by the German government. No rational basis was provided
                    for this allegation, which cannot therefore constitute fair
                criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Mr Shadrake’s proffered explanation
                    for the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement, which I have rejected, is
                    revealing of his attitude towards his sources. The source he cites for his
                    explanation is Mr Anandan’s autobiography, at p 142, which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As soon as Bohl was caught, the German government and its ambassador in
                        Singapore mounted a diplomatic offensive on her behalf, meeting several
                        senior Singapore government ministers in the process. <b><em>Coincidentally</em></b><em>, it was a technicality
                            that saved Bohl from the gallows in the wake of this campaign. Tests
                            revealed that the amount of pure cannabis seized in Bohl’s
                            apartment weighed in at only 281 grams, below the 500 grams threshold.
                            This meant that Bohl faced a jail sentence of five to twenty years
                            instead of execution</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of Mr Anandan’s autobiography, which
                    Mr Shadrake relied on, the prosecution could <em>not</em> have preferred a capital charge, because the amount of
                    cannabis seized was below the threshold of 500 grams. There was no discretion
                    involved whatsoever, contrary to Mr Shadrake’s insinuation in his
                    explanation that the government preferred the lighter charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Though irrelevant to his guilt or innocence in
                    the present case, I should observe that, for all his claims to be an activist
                    against the death penalty, Mr Shadrake appears willing to assert that Bohl
                    was guilty of a capital offence without much in the way of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 3<sup>rd</sup> statement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The 3<sup>rd</sup> statement,
                    at p 27 of the book, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It also put the spotlight on Singapore’s legal system which many
                        observers inside and outside the country believe has been perverted to suit
                        political and economic expediency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">“It” refers to the case of Ngyuen Tuong Van, an
                    Australian citizen who was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Mr Shadrake explained in his affidavit
                    that his intention in making the 3<sup>rd</sup> statement was to
                    criticise the laws passed by Parliament which in his view repressed free
                    discussion of the death penalty, including limitations on the right to assemble,
                    which he referred to in the paragraph just before the one where the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> statement is found. His reference to
                    “legal system” should therefore be read accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Once again, I find it difficult to read the
                    reference to the system as excluding the courts. But I do find that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> statement does not unambiguously refer to the
                    courts, or to any judicial act or function, in contrast to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> statement which refers to the imposition of
                    the death sentence. I therefore give Mr Shadrake the benefit of the doubt
                    that the 3<sup>rd</sup> statement does not specifically refer to
                    the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 4<sup>th</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The 4<sup>th</sup> statement,
                    at p 100 of the book, refers to the case of Maria Krol-Hmelak, who, together
                    with one Peter Johnson, was acquitted of drug trafficking by the late Lai Kew
                    Chai J. The 4<sup>th</sup> statement (in bold) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Following final submissions at the 28<sup>th</sup> session
                        [of the trial] which began on 29 October, Judge Lai suddenly announced them
                        both no guilty. Krol-Hmelak could hardly believe her ears. She was free.
                        Completely stunned she burst into tears sobbing ‘What’s
                        happening? What’s happening?’ She had been in jail for two and a
                        half years expecting she would end up on the gallows. Instead she heard
                        cries from embassy officials: ‘You’re free! You are free!’
                        It was an extraordinary end to the case in which few believed she would not
                        be found guilty and hanged. The ‘I didn’t know’ plea had
                        seemingly and perhaps miraculously worked for her <b>but in
                            Singapore funny things tend to happen on the way to their courtrooms
                            just as funny things happen when they arrive in a theatre to perform in
                            a comedy show</b>. However, in Singapore it has nothing to do
                        with humour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact, many believe that Krol-Hmelak was guilty. But to hang her
                        following the uproar over van Damme’s death sentence might not have
                        been wise. <b>So it was very likely a government verdict not
                            a judicial one. Singapore’s judiciary is not free to decide who
                            should live and who should die when vital business, economic and
                            diplomatic issues are at stake</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     These two paragraphs are set out in full
                    because Mr Shadrake says in his affidavit that if we read the paragraphs
                    together, it will be seen that he distinguishes foreign pressure and
                    negotiations with the executive during the prosecutorial stage as opposed to the
                    judicial sentencing stage where judges have no discretion to mitigate as the
                    death penalty is mandatory. He also referred to Mr Anandan’s
                    autobiography at p 143 and asserted again that diplomatic pressure occurs at the
                    prosecutorial stage. Hence, he says, the use of the phrase “on the way to
                    the courtrooms.” Mr Shadrake’s misguided reference to
                    Mr Anandan’s autobiography has already been referred to
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The reference to van Damme is to Johannes van
                    Damme, a Dutchman who was executed for trafficking around the time Krol-Hmelak
                    was arrested, and whose case is also discussed by Mr Shadrake in the same
                    chapter as Krol-Hmelak’s case. The chapter referred to anti-Singapore
                    sentiment in the Netherlands in relation to van Damme’s arrest and trial,
                    saying that “in a national poll half the [Dutch] population demanded the
                    government send warships to Singapore and rescue van Damme using military
                    force.” It concluded by saying that Krol-Hmelak left Singapore after
                    being acquitted and that “the result, despite the uproar when Johannes
                    van Damme was hanged, meant business as usual between the two countries. No one
                    wanted another demand, however frivolous, for Dutch warships to be sent to
                    Singapore to spring this aging granny from the shadow of the
                    gallows.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Mr Shadrake’s explanation in his
                    affidavit only related to the first part of the 4<sup>th</sup>
                    statement. In that regard, his comparison of the legal process to a comedy
                    performed in a threatre is clearly mischievous when read alongside his
                    description of how the judge “suddenly” acquitted Krol-Hmelak, how
                    her plea of ignorance “had seemingly and perhaps miraculously worked for
                    her”, and his allegation that “funny things tend to happen”
                    on the way to courtrooms in Singapore. Even if I were to give Mr Shadrake
                    the benefit of the doubt here (which in itself is rather difficult since English
                    is his native tongue), this would still leave unexplained the second and more
                    serious part of the 4<sup>th</sup> statement, which alleged that
                    the acquittal of Krol-Hmelak and Johnson “was very likely a government
                    verdict not a judicial one. Singapore’s judiciary is not free to decide
                    who should live and who should die when vital business, economic and diplomatic
                    issues are at stake.” Mr Shadrake’s affidavit had no
                    explanation for this plain allegation that the court ordered the acquittals
                    under pressure from the government or as a result of the dictates of business,
                    economics and diplomacy, not the rule of law. In his submissions, Mr Ravi
                    sought to justify this allegation on the basis that Lai Kew Chai J promised
                    to give detailed grounds for his decision but eventually did not do so. Even
                    assuming this to be a true account of the proceedings (absolutely no evidence
                    was given in this regard), Lai J’s eventual decision not to issue a
                    judgment can hardly form a rational basis for the grave allegation made by
                    Mr Shadrake, <em>ie</em> that Lai J’s verdict
                    was procured by the government. There can therefore be no fair criticism in
                    respect of the 4<sup>th</sup> statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I also note, once again, the ease with which
                    Mr Shadrake concludes that Krol-Hmelak was guilty of trafficking despite
                    her acquittal by the court and that was also the belief of “many”.
                    But he gives no supporting evidence despite having been given more than one
                    opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 5<sup>th</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The 5<sup>th</sup> statement
                    (in bold), at p 3 of the book, is general in nature and reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Many of the cases I have investigated in this book show
                            that justice in Singapore is patently biased against the weak and
                            disadvantaged while favouring the wealthy and privileged</b>.
                        This is especially true for foreigners from powerful countries willing and
                        able to use their economic might to have the death penalty
                        ‘abolished’ for their citizens. Business for Singapore is far
                        too important a matter to allow such a little local difficulty like killing
                        someone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I have set out the full paragraph because
                    Mr Shadrake explained in his affidavit that, “when
                    contextualised”, the 5<sup>th</sup> statement is clearly
                    directed against the political considerations being taken into account at the
                    prosecutorial stage. He relied in this regard on Julia Bohl’s case, where
                    he argued, relying on Mr Anandan’s autobiography, that diplomatic
                    pressure made a difference at the prosecutorial stage. He also states that his
                    conclusion is a reasonable inference that a neutral observer would draw when
                    looking at the cases highlighted and analysed side-by-side in his
                book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I cannot accept this explanation.
                    “Justice in Singapore” is not dispensed by the prosecution; it is
                    dispensed by the courts. Further, when read together with
                    Mr Shadrake’s allegation of a “government verdict” in
                    the Krol-Hmelak case (discussed above at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>–<a href="#p1_99">[99]</a>), and his
                    allegations of favouritism in the sentences of Dinesh Bhatia and Andrew Veale
                    (discussed below at <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a>–<a href="#p1_114">[114]</a>), it becomes apparent that the
                        5<sup>th</sup> statement encompasses cases where the courts
                    are alleged to favour the wealthy and the privileged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    As for Julia Bohl’s case, I have
                    already pointed out that Mr Anandan’s autobiography makes clear that
                    Bohl could not have been charged with a capital offence as the cocaine in her
                    possession was simply below the threshold quantity. There was no exercise of
                    prosecutorial discretion to prefer a non-capital charge. Mr Shadrake once
                    again displays a tendency to distort his own sources for his own
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 6<sup>th</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The 6<sup>th</sup> statement
                    (in bold), at p 5 of the book, is general in nature and reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For most of the past century governments have too often attempted to
                        justify their lethal fury with reference to the so-called benefits such
                        killing would bring to the rest of society. This is also Singapore’s
                        main argument for keeping the death penalty. But the bloodshed is real and
                        deeply destructive of the common decency of the community; the benefits are
                        illusory. More than this, <b>the implementation of capital
                            punishment is highly discriminatory. According to Amnesty International,
                            the death sentence is more likely to be imposed in Singapore on those
                            who are poorer and less educated making them more vulnerable than
                            average</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Here Mr Shadrake appears to be making an argument that those
                    convicted of capital crimes are more likely to be poorer and less educated.
                    Ms Subramanian sought to argue that the 6<sup>th</sup>
                    statement meant that the courts are biased against the poor and less educated.
                    Ms Subramanian submits that taken in the broader context of his unwarranted
                    and unsupportable comments made in relation to various individual cases,
                    Mr Shadrake is targeting the Singapore judiciary as being against the poor,
                    the less educated and the disadvantaged in Singapore society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    While there is some small basis for
                    Ms Subramanian’s submission, I have taken the passage complained
                    about in the context of the paragraph in which it appears. The reference to
                    Amnesty International’s report makes clear that Mr Shadrake in making
                    the 6<sup>th</sup> statement was talking only about the
                        <em>incidence</em> of the death penalty, and not
                    whether the courts are biased against certain groups in imposing the death
                    penalty. I therefore find that the 6<sup>th</sup> statement did
                    not allege any wrongdoing or impropriety on the part of the
                courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 7<sup>th</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The 7<sup>th</sup>
                    statement, made up of 3 passages at pp 140–141 of the book, refers to the
                    case of <em>Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v
                        PP</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Bhatia</em>”), where V K Rajah J (as he then was) reduced
                    the sentence of the defendant to eight months from the 12 months imposed by the
                    district court. The 3 passages in the 7<sup>th</sup> Statement
                    (in bold below) are found in two paragraphs, which open by referring to a drug
                    raid on 7 October 2004 before continuing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of the arrests that night, the most surprising was that of a former High
                        Court judge’s son, Dinesh Singh Bhatia, 35, a private equity investor.
                        His father, Amarjeet Singh, a former judicial commissioner and also a senior
                        counsel, served on the United Nations war crimes tribunal for the Balkans.
                        Dinesh’s mother, Dr Kanwaljit Soin, was a former Nominated MP and
                        orthopaedic surgeon, and director of the London-based Help Age
                        International, a global network helping the disadvantaged elderly. Dinesh
                        was charged with cocaine consumption, and was facing 10 years behind bars or
                        fined S$20,000 or both. <b>But funny things often seem to
                            happen on the way to court houses in Singapore. Instead of getting ten
                            years and a heavy fine, Bhatia, was jailed for only 12 months for
                            consuming cocaine</b>. His lawyer, a People’s Action Party
                        MP, K. Shanmugam, had told the court that Bhatia was not an addict at all.
                        He was given a drug by a friend but ‘did not know that it was
                        cocaine’ although he had a ‘fleeting suspicion’ the
                        substance could be illegal. ‘He took in only impulse’, said
                        Shanmugam. <b>An internet blogger wryly commented: ‘I
                            would not remotely suggest that it might have helped Bhatia’s case
                            that his father was a judge, and his mother a former Singapore Member of
                            Parliament. Ignorance of the law is no defence!’</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So should Bhatia, a sophisticate about town, have known he was sticking
                        something illegal up his nose? On 7 April 2005, according to court records,
                        Bhatia appealed against his 12-month sentence and asked for a heavy fine
                        instead. Calling the previous sentence ‘excessive’, the appeal
                        judge, VK Rajah, said that the district judge erred by not tailoring the
                        sentence to fit the offender and failed to ‘attach adequate weight and
                        merit to all the relevant mitigating factors.’ He said the trial judge
                        did not adequately consider the fact that Bhatia’s consumption was
                        neither planned nor purchased. Justice Rajah then cut Bhatia’s
                        sentence to eight months. <b>On 7 July 2005, The Straits
                            Times reported that Bhatia was ‘now at home serving out his
                            sentence wearing an electronic tag he cannot remove’. It did not
                            say when this favourable treatment began</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In these two paragraphs, Mr Shadrake
                    describes Bhatia’s initial sentence as “only 12 months” as
                    opposed to “10 years and a heavy fine”, refers to the identities
                    and social position of Bhatia’s parents, refers to the sarcastic comment
                    of an internet blogger that Bhatia’s sentence had nothing to do with the
                    identities of his parents, and describes Bhatia’s home detention as
                    “favourable treatment”. The juxtaposition of facts is mischievous,
                    and the unmistakable insinuation is that Bhatia was shown favouritism both in
                    his sentence and the way he served it. Bhatia’s home detention has nothing
                    to do with the courts, but the presentation of the facts makes it possible that
                    an uninformed reader would draw the conclusion that it was also arranged by the
                    courts. However, I am prepared to give Mr Shadrake the benefit of the doubt
                    in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    As for Mr Shadrake’s grave
                    insinuation that Bhatia’s sentence was a result of favouritism by Rajah J,
                    nothing was cited as support in the book other than the suggestive reference to
                    the identities of Bhatia’s parents when discussing the sentence. This
                    certainly cannot form a rational basis for such a grave
                allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    What is more, the allegation was clearly
                    made recklessly. Mr Ravi confirmed no less than five times during the
                    hearing that Mr Shadrake <em>had read</em> the
                    reported judgment. Yet, no effort was made to refer to and refute the reasons
                    given in Rajah J’s judgment, which would have been the most obvious thing
                    to do if one was going to allege that the sentence was given as a result of
                    favouritism and could not stand up to scrutiny. There was not even any evidence
                    to show that Mr Shadrake had done research showing that the sentence given
                    to Bhatia was lighter than the norm (and this alone would hardly have formed a
                    rational basis for saying that the sentence was a result of favouritism). Again
                    Mr Shadrake sought to rely on Mr Anandan’s autobiography. But a
                    perusal of the relevant pages, pp 139–140, shows that they do not support
                    his allegation at all:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... There are still many inconsistencies in the way the courts treat drug
                        offenders. I brought this up in 2005 in the inaugural issue of <em>Pro Bono</em>, the newsletter of the Association of
                        Criminal Lawyers of Singapore. I cited the big cocaine bust in Seletar Camp
                        involving a former internet entrepreneur. The accused pleaded guilty to a
                        single charge of cocaine consumption and has his 12-month sentence reduced
                        to eight months on appeal. I was approached to handle his appeal but there
                        was a conflict of interest because I represented Guiga Laroussi, the man who
                        had supplied him with the cocaine. In the appeal by the former internet
                        entrepreneur, Justice V K Rajah ruled that all first time offenders should
                        be jailed for six to 18 months. Fines, he said, should be imposed only
                        “sparingly” and in “purely exceptional” cases
                        involving Class A drugs or hardcore drugs like heroin and cocaine. But I
                        wrote that the court’s ruling did little to clarify the position on
                        sentencing. Justice Rajah did not clarify what he meant by
                        “sparingly” or what constituted a “purely
                        exceptional” case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I pointed out that there was a “clear conflict” between the
                        views expressed in the former internet entrepreneur’s case and in four
                        other cases heard by then Chief Justice Yong Pung How, who has since retired
                        from the bench. In an earlier case involving Ecstasy abuser Ooi Joo Keong,
                        the Chief Justice upheld a decision by Senior District Judge Richard Magnus
                        to jail him for 12 months, ruling that first offenders should be jailed for
                        12 to 18 months. I pointed out that three other cases sent out different
                        signals. In a case involving insurance manager Ng Kheng Tiak, who had a
                        couple of puffs of cannabis, the Chief Justice fined him $20,000 and set
                        aside the 12-month prison term imposed by the Lower Court. In another case,
                        footballer Muhammad Razali Ishak’s one-year jail term for smoking
                        cannabis at a birthday party was set aside and replaced with two
                        years’ probation, a $5,000 bond by his parents and 100 hours of
                        community service. Polytechnic student Pililis Nikiforos escaped an
                        eight-month jail term in 2001 for morphine use and the Chief Justice instead
                        imposed a $5,000 fine. Our take on this is that when sentencing an offender,
                        which of these decisions should district judges follow?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is apparent from the passages above that of the 4 cases of drug
                    consumption mentioned by Mr Anandan, in 3 cases, an insurance manager, a
                    footballer and a polytechnic student had their 8 to 12 month prison sentences
                    set aside and were only punished with fines. To say on this basis that
                    Bhatia’s jail sentence of 8 months was light evinces not just a propensity
                    but an intention to distort sources. As for the fourth case, Ooi Joo
                    Keong’s case, it was clearly explained in Rajah J’s judgment, which
                    Mr Ravi confirmed that Mr Shadrake had read, as relating only to
                    first-time drug consumers <em>with antecedents</em>, not a
                    first time offender with no antecedents, such as Bhatia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Further, the statement that Bhatia
                    “was jailed for only 12 months” instead of “getting 10
                    years and a heavy fine” was plainly misleading and obviously wrong. 10
                    years’ imprisonment or a $20,000 fine or both was the <em>maximum</em> penalty for the offence under consideration, and it
                    frankly does not take very much to realise that, as a first-time offender,
                    Bhatia would not have been facing the maximum prison sentence of 10 years. When
                    I sought clarification on this point, Mr Ravi very fairly acknowledged that
                    he too had some difficulty with the statement, and sought an adjournment to
                    consult with Mr Shadrake. When we resumed after 20 minutes, Mr Ravi
                    informed me that Mr Shadrake conceded he had made a mistake and would be
                    making the necessary correction in the next edition of the book. However
                    Mr Ravi said Mr Shadrake was not withdrawing anything else but that
                    wrong statement and that whilst Mr Shadrake had informed his publisher to
                    make a correction, he had no control over the publisher. But nothing was said
                    about the rest of the 7<sup>th</sup> statement, and in light of
                    the foregoing I cannot but conclude that the 7<sup>th</sup>
                    statement was made recklessly, without regard to its truth or
                falsehood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I also note that, in his affidavit,
                    Mr Shadrake sought to justify the 7<sup>th</sup> statement
                    by saying:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if [the 7<sup>th</sup> statement] can be interpreted
                        as a direct criticism of the judicial decision, this was based on a similar
                        argument used by Mr Subhas Anandan in his autobiography at page
                        139-140. There, Mr Anandan notes the discrepancy in the sentence meted
                        out to Bhatia before concluding that “this has partly to do with the
                        fact that the law is so out of sync with other First World Countries which
                        Singapore aspires to be.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I set out the relevant part of Mr Anandan’s autobiography
                    at pp 140–141 from which this passage was taken:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Another problem in my view is the use of entrapment to snare drug
                        offenders. I believe it should be allowed to a certain degree, otherwise
                        you’ll never catch the crooks. But the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)
                        should not overdo it. I’ve said on record before that I think the CNB
                        crossed the line in the case of insurance agent Teo Ya Lin in 2003. She was
                        pressured by an undercover CNB officer to procure an Ecstasy Pill for him
                        promising that he would buy an insurance policy from her in return. Teo got
                        him a pill and the result for her troubles was a prison term of more than
                        six years. This girl had no intention of selling drugs until she was
                        persuaded by the officer. Under normal circumstances, she would not have
                        been categorised as a trafficker. There is also the issue of whether the CNB
                        officer should be guilty of abettment [<em>sic</em>]
                        for the offence. He instigated the offence by putting the idea into her head
                        through misrepresentation. Indeed, there is a lot of grey area in
                        Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act. <em>I believe this has
                            partly to do with the fact that the law is so out of sync with other
                            First World countries which Singapore aspires to be</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The sentence relied on by Mr Shadrake was clearly made in
                    relation to entrapment. By connecting it to sentencing, Mr Shadrake once
                    again evinced a tendency to grossly distort his sources.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 8<sup>th</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The 8<sup>th</sup>
                    statement, at p 141 of the book, refers to the cases of Andrew Veale and
                    Penelope Pang, two other drug consumers who were caught in the same operation
                    which netted Dinesh Bhatia. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Briton Andrew Veale, a top financial broker and a 10 year resident, who
                        drove a Rolls Royce often with his Singaporean girlfriend, Penelope Pang
                        Su-yin, 35, daughter of the organiser of the Miss Universe pageant, were
                        next to appear in court. They too got off lightly with jail sentences
                        amounting to no more than eight months with remission. Veale, was a broker
                        with Structured Credit Desk dealing in derivatives and financial products,
                        and the sort of people Singapore needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Mr Shadrake gives the same explanation
                    for the 8<sup>th</sup> statement as he did for the
                        7<sup>th</sup> statement: it is directed against the light
                    charges brought by the prosecution against Veale and Pang. He does not say what
                    charges should have been brought, and in any case this explanation is clearly
                    untenable given his allegation that “they too got off lightly with jail
                    sentences amounting to no more than eight months with remission”, and
                    that Veale “was the sort of people Singapore needs”. This clearly
                    insinuates that Veale was given a light sentence by the court due to extraneous
                    considerations, <em>viz</em> he was “the sort of
                    people Singapore needs”. In contrast to Bhatia’s case,
                    Mr Shadrake did not even attempt to justify this allegation with reference
                    to sentencing precedents. In any case, as I have said, it is one thing to allege
                    a sentencing discrepancy; it is quite another to allege intentional bias or
                    favouritism. It should also be noted that Veale and Pang’s case and
                    sentence were also discussed and explained in Rajah J’s published judgment
                    for Bhatia’s case (see <em>Bhatia</em> at [46] and
                    [48]), which, once again, Mr Shadrake said he read but did not attempt even
                    to criticise. There is no rational basis for Mr Shadrake’s
                    insinuation that the court sentencing Veale gave him a light sentence because he
                    was “the sort of people Singapore needs”, and for that reason it
                    cannot amount to fair criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I should add that Veale received a prison
                    sentence of 12 months because he had a pattern of purchase and consumption and
                    Ms Pang received an 11 month prison sentence because her consumption was
                    premeditated, unlike Bhatia: see [46] to [48] and [7] to [12] of Rajah J’s
                    judgment. Mr Shadrake described their sentences as “8 months
                        <em>with remission</em>” (emphasis added), while
                    describing Bhatia’s sentence as simply 8 months. This is likely to create
                    a false impression in the mind of the reader. Seen in the light of the various
                    liberties Mr Shadrake had taken with other facts, it is difficult to take a
                    benign view of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>
                and 11<sup>th</sup> statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The 9<sup>th</sup> to
                        11<sup>th</sup> statements can be taken together. They refer
                    to the case of Vignes Mourthi, who was convicted of drug trafficking and
                    sentenced to death (see <em>PP v Vignes s/o Mourthi &amp;
                        Anor</em> [2002] SGHC 240, affirmed in <em>Vignes s/o Mourthi v PP</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 105). The
                        9<sup>th</sup> statement, at p 162 of the book,
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No doubt many members of Singapore’s judiciary were also aware of
                        what was going on behind the scenes concerning the rape, sodomy and
                        corruption charges hanging over Rajkumar, yet not one of them had the guts
                        to speak out in protest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 10<sup>th</sup> statement, at p 163 of the book,
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But I can reveal, following intensive inquiries and talking in confidence
                        to several lawyers on condition that I would not expose them to the
                        authorities in any way, that the high echelons of the judiciary and
                        prosecution from the Attorney General down knew all about Rajkumar and were
                        intent on keeping his evil, corrupt deeds under wraps until Vignes Mourthi
                        was hanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 11<sup>th</sup> statement, at p 165 of the book,
                    the last page of the chapter on Vignes Mourthi, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here the words of the Nobel Laureate, Amartya Sen, seem the
                        most appropriate postscript to the sordid tale of the death of Vignes Mourti
                            [<em>sic</em>]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... Democracy becomes dysfunctional when the bureaucracy, the
                            judiciary, the legislature, the private sector, the police and the
                            military all use their power to enrich themselves and advance their own
                            interests at the expense of civil society. Laws not withstanding,
                            corruption undermines the rule of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The statements relate to the fact that Sgt
                    Rajkumar from the Central Narcotics Bureau was under investigation for offences
                    under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 2002 Rev Ed) at about
                    the same time as he was giving evidence in Mourthi’s case. Sgt Rajkumar
                    was subsequently convicted on the same corruption offences: see <em>PP v S Rajkumar</em> [2005] SGDC 77. The charges
                    related, among other things, to offering a bribe to a woman he was alleged to
                    have raped, in an attempt to induce her to withdraw her complaints. This was
                    apparently not disclosed to the trial judge in Mourthi’s
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Mr Ravi argued this point with great
                    passion and appeared at times to be arguing that this was a miscarriage of
                    justice. This was understandable given that Mr Ravi was, as he informed the
                    court, the counsel who unsuccessfully sought to reopen the case after the Court
                    of Appeal dismissed Mourthi’s appeal: see <em>Vignes s/o
                        Mourthi v PP</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 300; <em>Vignes Mourthi v PP</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 518.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Ms Subramanian disputed
                    Mr Shadrake’s claim in his affidavit that Mourthi was convicted on
                    the strength of Sgt Rajkumar’s evidence. She referred me to the grounds of
                    decision of the trial judge, who stated at [96] and [98] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96 On the totality of the evidence adduced, it was impossible to accept
                        that B1 thought he had been given a packet of "sambrani kallu" by B2. It was
                        something that could be easily purchased with a small amount of money. It
                        was extremely odd that B2 should ask him to pass something of no great value
                        or apparent consequence to someone B1 had not even met before on his first
                        day back at work after the accident, especially when B1 did not have his own
                        means of transport. Further, why could not B2 have brought the small packet
                        along with him when he went to B1’s house in the evening of 19
                        September 2001? Why was there a need for him to return a few hours later in
                        the early hours of 20 September 2001 just to pass such a packet to him? What
                        was the urgency that caused B2 to wait for the rain to stop and to travel to
                        his house in the middle of the night? The evidence showed clearly that
                        something surreptitious was happening and if B1 appeared so uninquisitive,
                        it could only mean that he was aware of what was in the packet that he was
                        to bring into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98 I believed the Prosecution’s witnesses who said that B1 had used
                        a word which was also street jargon for heroin in granular form in his
                        statements. It could not be that ASP Krishnan, SGT Rajkumar, the
                        investigating officer and the Tamil interpreter all misunderstood him
                        throughout or simply refused to qualify "kallu" with "sambrani". In any
                        event, the Tamil interpreter stated that these two words were not used
                        together in the Tamil language. I had no doubt that all the statements taken
                        from B1 had been recorded accurately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ms Subramanian also referred me to the judgment of the Court of
                    Appeal at [2003] 3 SLR(R) 105 at [38] where the Court of Appeal
                    expressly stated: “Looking at the totality of the evidence, we endorse
                    the finding of the court below that Vignes knew that he was transporting drugs
                    for sale”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    As I have noted above, I am not required to
                    decide whether Mourthi was convicted rightly or wrongly in assessing whether
                    Mr Shadrake was within his right of fair criticism. Certainly it was within
                    Mr Shadrake’s right of fair criticism to question whether
                    Mourthi’s conviction was safe, given that information pertaining to the
                    credibility of a particular witness in the trial was not given to the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    But Mr Shadrake did much more than
                    that. He said in no uncertain terms that the high echelons of the judiciary, by
                    which he must mean the judges of the Supreme Court, <em>knew</em> about Sgt Rajkumar’s misdeeds and were deliberately
                    and culpably suppressing the fact of the investigation into his acts and the
                    proceedings against him until after Mourthi was executed. This is certainly one
                    of the most serious allegations that can ever be made against the Supreme Court
                    bench.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In support of this grave allegation
                    Mr Shadrake had nothing more to say than to point out that the subordinate
                    judiciary, who deal with 95% of the cases in Singapore, and the prosecutors, are
                    both drawn from the ranks of the Legal Service, and in light of this the
                    judiciary would have known of the proceedings against Sgt Rajkumar. Reference
                    was also made to the fact that some of the judges of the Supreme Court were
                    elevated from the subordinate courts, or had served stints at the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers. I unhesitatingly reject this as simply too
                    incredulous and attenuated to form a rational basis for Mr Shadrake’s
                    grave assertion that the trial judge and the high echelons of the judiciary knew
                    of Sgt Rajkumar’s misdeeds and were complicit in the suppression of
                    possibly exculpatory evidence in a capital case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    As for the 11<sup>th</sup>
                    statement, Mr Shadrake says in his affidavit that it is a quote from
                    Amartya Sen which addresses the situation in India, and “obviously not
                    directly analogous to Singapore.” But this was obviously not his purpose
                    in quoting Amartya Sen – the 11<sup>th</sup> statement
                    states that the Amartya Sen quote seems “the most appropriate postscript
                    to the sordid tale of the death of Vignes Mourthi.” It will be noticed
                    that Mr Shadrake does not explicitly give any reason why “the high
                    echelons of the judiciary” knew all about Sgt Rajkumar and were intent on
                    covering it up until Mourthi was hanged. The quote at the end of the chapter
                    insinuates the motive: that judges “use their power to enrich themselves
                    and advance their own interests at the expense of civil society.”
                    Unsurprisingly, no rational basis was given for this insinuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 12<sup>th</sup> statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The 12<sup>th</sup>
                    statement, at p 18 of the book, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the legal system was based on English law it was soon fine-tuned
                        to ensure that Lee Kuan Yew and his People’s Action Party remained in
                        power in perpetuity by silencing all political opposition through fear of
                        being jailed as ‘communists’ or financially ruined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    As I suggested to Ms Subramanian during
                    the hearing, one can be jailed as a communist under statutes such as the
                    Internal Security Act (Cap 143, 1985 Rev Ed) and the Criminal Law
                    (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67, 2000 Rev Ed), which permit
                    detention without trial. Likewise, one can be financially ruined without going
                    through the courts, or through meritorious legal actions decided without
                    improper conduct on the part of the courts. In the circumstances, I am willing
                    to give Mr Shadrake the benefit of the doubt and find that the
                        12<sup>th</sup> statement was not directed at the courts, or
                    at least did not impute any improper conduct to the courts. I also give
                    Mr Shadrake the benefit of the doubt in respect of
                    Ms Subramanian’s argument that the 12<sup>th</sup>
                    statement should be read in light of the 13<sup>th</sup> and
                        14<sup>th</sup> statements, seeing that the
                        12<sup>th</sup> statement is made at the beginning of the
                    book, at p 18, whereas the 13<sup>th</sup> and
                        14<sup>th</sup> statements are made towards the end, at pp
                    217 and 207.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 13<sup>th</sup> and
                    14<sup>th</sup> statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The 13<sup>th</sup> and
                        14<sup>th</sup> statements can be dealt with together. The
                        13<sup>th</sup> statement, at p 217 of the book,
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The absence of independence in a compliant judiciary and a media silenced
                        through state ownership and the ever-present threat of defamation and libel
                        suits have created a climate for the suppression of basic political
                        freedoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 14<sup>th</sup> statement (in bold), at p 207 of
                    the book, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ruling party in Singapore often sues those who dare oppose it on
                        trumped up defamation charges, forcing many into bankruptcy or exile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The 13<sup>th</sup>
                    statement explicitly says that the judiciary is compliant and not independent.
                    The 14<sup>th</sup> statement clearly implies that the courts
                    will find for the ruling party even if it brings “trumped up defamation
                    charges”. Similar statements have been held to be contemptuous in
                        <em>Pang Cheng Lian</em>, <em>Zimmerman</em>, <em>Wain Barry</em>, <em>Lingle</em>, <em>Chee Soon Juan</em> and
                        <em>Hertzberg</em>. I have earlier expressed my doubts
                    that criticisms of the judiciary’s conduct and partiality <em>ipso facto</em> constitute contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Mr Shadrake claims, both in his book
                    and his affidavit, to have relied on the IBA report in making the
                        13<sup>th</sup><sup></sup>statement. In respect of the 14<sup>th</sup>
                    statement, Mr Shadrake only said that this is directed at the political
                    tactics of the ruling party. This is unsupportable: his insinuation that
                    “trumped up defamation charges” are nevertheless successful
                    “in forcing many into bankruptcy or exile” is clearly directed at
                    the courts. But, for completeness, I will also compare the IBA report and the
                        14<sup>th</sup> statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Mr Ravi placed great reliance on how
                    the IBA report, relied upon by Mr Shadrake, was published without its
                    authors being charged or held for contempt. Ms Subramanian argued that the
                    repetition of a contemptuous publication is a further contempt. It is neither
                    necessary nor appropriate for me to examine why the authors of the IBA report
                    were not charged or held for contempt. For present purposes, it is sufficient
                    for me to examine how Mr Shadrake treats the IBA report which he himself
                    chose to rely on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    On its face, the IBA report appears to make
                    an effort to present a balanced view of the issues it addresses, giving
                    arguments and evidence both <em>pro</em> and <em>contra</em> its viewpoints. I look at one incident examined
                    in the IBA report: the transfer of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo from his
                    judicial position to the Attorney-General’s Chambers in 1984, which some
                    allege was related to his acquittal of Mr JB Jeyaretnam, an opposition
                    leader, of certain charges preferred against the latter. In examining this
                    incident, the IBA report referred to the fact that a Committee of Inquiry was
                    convened to investigate the incident and concluded that there was no executive
                    interference in the subordinate courts. It considered Parliament’s
                    discussion of the Committee’s findings, and quotes from both sides of the
                    debate. It also noted the Law Society’s view that nothing improper had
                    occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I also look at how the IBA report eventually
                    concluded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in cases involving PAP [People Action Party, the presently ruling
                        party] litigants or PAP interests, there are concerns about an actual or
                        apparent lack of impartiality and/or independence, which casts doubt on the
                        decisions made in such cases. Although this may not go so far as claimed by
                        some non-governmental organisations, which allege that the judiciary is
                        entirely controlled by the will of the executive, there are sufficient
                        reasons to worry about the influence of the executive over judicial decision
                        making. Regardless of any actual interference, the reasonable suspicion of
                        interference is sufficient. In addition, it appears that some of the
                        objective characteristics of judicial independence, including security of
                        tenure, separation from the executive branch and administrative independence
                        may be absent from the Singapore judicial system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Contrast Mr Shadrake’s writing.
                    There is a complete absence, not just in the 13<sup>th</sup> and
                        14<sup>th</sup> statements, but in the whole of the chapter
                    in which they appear, of the primary facts to which the IBA report referred. The
                    assertions which Mr Shadrake made go several degrees higher than what the
                    IBA report felt able to conclude – contrast, for example, the IBA
                    report’s distinctly qualified tone and Mr Shadrake’s bare
                    assertion in the 13<sup>th</sup> statement about “the
                    absence of independence in a compliant judiciary.” This, it should be
                    remembered, was Mr Shadrake’s only source. In distorting it as
                    grossly as he did, I think Mr Shadrake has passed beyond wrong-headed
                    criticism that is nevertheless made in good faith; he has displayed, at the very
                    least, a reckless disregard for the truth or falsehood of the allegations he
                    makes. This is aggravated by his claim that his book is a product of his
                    investigative journalism. This disqualifies him from claiming fair criticism in
                    respect of the 13<sup>th</sup> and
                        14<sup>th</sup> statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In his book, Mr Shadrake claims to be
                    an advocate against the death penalty. He claims that a disproportionate number
                    of those sentenced to death come from less advantaged backgrounds. He claims to
                    have identified a miscarriage of justice in a capital case because facts which
                    may have affected the credibility of a prosecution witness were not presented to
                    the court. He claims to have identified sentencing discrepancies. On these
                    matters he may be correct or he may be wrong, but he is within his rights, which
                    I am constitutionally bound to uphold. I should emphasise in particular that
                    there is nothing in the law which prohibits advocating for the abolition of the
                    death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    He has also made certain allegations against
                    other parts of the legal system, but that is not my concern here. So the
                        3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and
                        12<sup>th</sup> statements, which do not unambiguously refer
                    to the courts, do not amount to contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    But in the remaining 11 statements
                    Mr Shadrake went beyond advocating the abolition of the death penalty and
                    criticising the merits of individual judgments. He alleges grave misconduct on
                    the part of the courts. There is a world of difference between these two
                    positions: it is one thing to say that a judge erred in law or in fact; it is
                    another to say that he acted on the instructions of the executive. In discussing
                    the case of Julia Bohl (the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement),
                    Mr Shadrake claims that the courts gave a light sentence arranged for by
                    the Singapore government under threat of economic reprisals by the German
                    government. In discussing the case of Maria Krol-Hmelak and Peter Johnson (the
                        4<sup>th</sup> statement), he claims that the courts
                    succumbed to executive and diplomatic pressure in acquitting two accused persons
                    in a capital case. In discussing the cases of Dinesh Bhatia, Andrew Veale and
                    Penelope Pang (the 7<sup>th</sup> and
                        8<sup>th</sup> statements), he claims that the rich and
                    well-connected are shown favouritism and given light sentences. In discussing
                    the case of Vignes Mourthi (the 9<sup>th</sup>,
                        10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>
                    statements), he claims that the Supreme Court judiciary has culpably suppressed
                    possibly exculpatory evidence in a capital case. He has also made sweeping
                    statements repeating these claims (the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        5<sup>th</sup> statements). I have said that a person is not
                    precluded from fair criticism even if it extends to the conduct of the
                    judiciary, but fair criticism must be supported by a rational basis for the
                    criticism made, and Mr Shadrake has simply not furnished any rational bases
                    for these very serious accusations. For good measure, it should also be noted
                    that Mr Shadrake claims that the judiciary is a complaint tool of political
                    oppression (the 13<sup>th</sup> and
                        14<sup>th</sup> statements). In doing so he has been so
                    selective with the sources he claims to rely on, and so trenchant in his claims,
                    that I must conclude that he did not care whether what he said was true or
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Mr Shadrake’s technique is to
                    make or insinuate his claims against a dissembling and selective background of
                    truths and half-truths, and sometimes outright falsehoods. In Julia Bohl’s
                    case, he cobbles together the fact that the German government was mounting a
                    diplomatic offensive on her behalf and the fact that her capital charge was
                    reduced to a non-capital charge, and jumps to the conclusion that the
                    prosecution had succumbed to diplomatic pressure. All the while he conveniently
                    omits the fact, noted in his own source of information, that the amount of drugs
                    in that case was simply insufficient to support a capital charge. In Maria
                    Krol-Hmelak’s case, he juxtaposes the tensions with the Dutch government
                    over the prior execution of van Damme, the fact that Krol-Hmelak was acquitted
                    by Lai Kew Chai J, and the fact that the learned judge did not eventually issue
                    written grounds, in order to draw the far-fetched conclusion that it was
                    “a government verdict, not a judicial one.” In the cases of Dinesh
                    Bhatia, Andrew Veale and Penelope Pang, he essentially asserts that they
                    received light sentences simply because they were wealthy or well-connected or
                    “the kind of people Singapore needs”. In the latter two cases
                    Mr Shadrake does not bother to look at the sentencing precedents. In the
                    former case he positively omits the fact that the jail sentence handed down was
                    significantly more severe than three out of the four cases cited in his own
                    source, Mr Anandan’s autobiography, where only fines were imposed. In
                    Vignes Mourthi’s case, he makes the bare assertion that the Supreme Court
                    judiciary must have known that a key witness was being investigated for
                    corruption, and only later supplied the completely untenable rationale that the
                    Legal Service and the judiciary were “porous”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    As can be seen, a technique such as
                    Mr Shadrake’s cannot withstand forensic analysis. But a casual and
                    unwary reader, who does not subject the book to detailed scrutiny, might well
                    believe his claims, especially since Mr Shadrake has claimed that the book
                    was a product of months of investigative journalism. Given that the book is or
                    was available publicly, and continues to be circulated, there is certainly more
                    than a remote possibility that, if the matter had been left unchecked, some
                    members of the public might have believed Mr Shadrake’s claims, and
                    in so doing would have lost confidence in the administration of justice in
                    Singapore. Accordingly, I find that the 11 remaining statements are in contempt
                    of court. Since these statements are made without any rational basis, or with
                    reckless disregard as to their truth or falsehood, they also do not fall to be
                    protected by the defence of fair criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I therefore find Mr Shadrake guilty of
                    the offence of contempt by scandalising the court and convict him
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I will hear counsel on sentence and costs
                    one week from now. If Mr Shadrake wishes to apologise or otherwise make
                    amends for his contempt, counsel should also submit on the weight to be given to
                    the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I should like to close this rather extended
                    judgment with a few observations. The death penalty is the ultimate punishment
                    under law, ultimate both in its severity and its irreversibility. It is
                    therefore not surprising that the application of the death penalty by the courts
                    is closely scrutinised and vigorously debated; indeed, it would be profoundly
                    disturbing if society comes to adopt a bland and disinterested attitude towards
                    the ultimate punishment carried out in its name. We judges have no interest in
                    stifling such debate and indeed debate on all other matters of public interest,
                    including our conduct. We are constitutionally bound to protect every
                    citizen’s right to engage in such debate, even if – in fact,
                    especially if – it is critical of us. But when such debate goes beyond the
                    limits of fair criticism the law will step in. It does so not for the sake of
                    the dignity of the judges. It does so only to ensure the public’s
                    confidence in the administration of justice does not falter, and this in the
                    final analysis is the surest guarantee that justice will in fact be
                    administered, in accordance with law.</p>
