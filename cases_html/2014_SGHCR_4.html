<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
growing sophistication of international commercial transactions has
led to the increasing incidence of complex disputes involving multiple parties
and multiple contracts arising from a single commercial enterprise, with
the traditional two-party dispute scenario fast becoming the exception rather
than the norm. Consequently, international arbitration, as the leading
mode of resolving international commercial disputes, increasingly finds
itself faced with difficult and arguably as yet unresolved issues
relating to joinder of third parties and consolidation of disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It
was decided in <em>The “Titan Unity”</em> [2013]
SGHCR 28 (‘<em>The “Titan Unity”’</em>) that
the applicable threshold to determine the <em>existence</em> of
an arbitration agreement in order to invoke the the court’s jurisdiction
to grant a stay in favour of arbitration pursuant to section 6 of
the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”)
is that of a <em>prima facie</em> standard.
As the court was satisfied that there exists an arbitration agreement
between the plaintiff, (“Portigon”) and the first defendant demise
charterer (“Oceanic”), the action against Oceanic was stayed in
favour of arbitration at the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration
(“SCMA”). The present decision deals with the application made by
the second defendant shipowner (“Singapore Tankers”) to set aside
and strike out Portigon’s action, and the question of whether this court
should order that Singapore Tankers be joined to the arbitration proceedings
between Portigon and Oceanic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As
the background to the dispute has been set out in <em>The
“Titan Unity”</em> at [2] to [6], it would suffice for the
purposes of the present decision to highlight the following facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Portigon
provided financing to a company, Onsys Energy Pte Ltd (“Onsys”)
for the purchase of a cargo of fuel oil by the issuance of a letter
of credit dated 20 January 2012. As the holder of bills of lading
which acknowledges the carriage of a cargo of 5,003.373 MT of fuel
oil 380CST on board the vessel (“bills of lading”), “TITAN UNITY”
(official no. 393242) (“the vessel”), Portigon commenced a claim
in misdelivery of cargo by filing an admiralty in rem action against
both defendants on 26 July 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As
pleaded by Portigon in its statement of claim, the bills of lading contained
a clear and unequivocal representation that Singapore Tankers was
the contractual carrier of the cargo, because the master of the
vessel (an employee of the manager of the vessel, Titan Ocean Pte
Ltd) had stamped the bills of lading with the stamp of Singapore
Tankers. Portigon claims that Oceanic and Singapore Tankers, both
being the carriers and persons being in physical possession of the
cargo, have failed to take reasonable care of the cargo, breached
the contract of carriage, and converted the cargo by having delivered
the cargo to third parties on 27 January 2012 without presentation
of the bills of lading. Portigon claims the sum of US$3,687,485.90
which represents the invoice value of the cargo, for the direct
loss arising from the defendants’ breaches and/or conversion of
the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequent
to the arrest of the vessel on 24 June 2013, Singapore Tankers applied
to set aside and strike out the admiralty writ pursuant to O 12
r 7 and O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
Ed) (“Rules of Court”) respectively. The application also seeks
in the alternative for the release of the vessel pursuant to O 70
r 12 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Counsel
for Singapore Tankers argued that the action should be set aside
or struck out as the claim is time-barred pursuant to Article III
rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the carrier and the ship shall in any
event be discharged from all liability whatsoever in respect of
the goods, unless suit is brought within one year of their delivery
or of the date when they should have been delivered. This period
may, however, be extended if the parties so agree after the cause
of action has arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It
was submitted that the Hague-Visby Rules is applicable to the bills of
lading, and sought to rely on the time bar defence by submitting
that no <em>competent suit</em> has been
brought within 12 months of the alleged mis-delivery of the cargo.
It was alleged that the cargo had been discharged by 2 February
2012, so that a competent suit must be brought by 2 February 2013.
According to Singapore Tankers, “suit” for the purposes of Article
III rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules must refer to a competent suit
which was brought before the correct forum, and it was submitted
that the suit against Singapore Tankers was not a competent one
as it was brought in breach of the arbitration agreement between
Portigon and Oceanic, where Portigon’s action against Oceanic have
been stayed in favour of arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Counsel
for Portigon submitted, <em>inter alia</em>,
that the time bar defence goes to the merits of the action and does
not constitute a jurisdictional objection. It was further submitted
that the Hague-Visby Rules do not in any event apply in the present
case as a purposive interpretation of section 3(2) of the Carriage
of Goods by Sea Act (Cap. 33) would show that the Hague-Visby Rules
are applicable only to shipments between ports, which is not the
situation in the present case. Counsel also submitted that that there
is no indication of the date in which the alleged time bar would
start from because there is no evidence of the actual date in which
the delivery of the cargo had been completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the writ should be set
aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Singapore
Tankers stated the ground in support of the application on the face
of its summons as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiff’s claim is time-barred pursuant
to Article III rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules because no competent
suit has been brought within 12 months of the alleged mis-delivery
of the cargo. The suit is not competent as to the merits of the
Plaintiff’s claim because it has been brought in breach of an arbitration
agreement incorporated into the Bills of Lading sued upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Singapore
Tankers is in effect attempting to avail itself of the benefit of
the arbitration agreement between Portigon and Oceanic. Portigon’s action
against Oceanic has been stayed in favour of arbitration, and it would
be up to the arbitral tribunal to decide whether the time bar under the
Hague-Visby Rules is applicable. Assuming <em>arguendo</em> if
the arbitral tribunal finds that Portigon’s claim against Oceanic
is time barred, that finding would not bar Portigon’s claim against
Singapore Tankers from proceeding <em>unless</em> the
dispute between Portigon and Singapore Tankers was, just like the
dispute between Portigon and Oceanic, part of the arbitration reference
placed before the arbitral tribunal.  As far as Singapore Tankers
is concerned, even if Portigon had commenced arbitral proceedings
against Oceanic and court proceedings against Singapore Tankers <em>within</em> 12 months of the alleged mis-delivery
of cargo, Singapore Tankers’ position would,  based on the ground
as stated in its summons, still be the same, which is that the action
brought by Portigon against Singapore Tankers is <em>not</em> a
competent one as it has been brought in breach of the arbitration
agreement between Portigon and Oceanic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On
this analysis, the true purport of the position taken by Singapore Tankers
is that Portigon’s claim in court should <em>properly</em> be
the subject matter of the arbitral proceedings between Portigon
and Oceanic such that the time bar under the Hague-Visby Rules applies.
This is at best an argument analogous to the <em>forum
non conveniens</em> scenario that the court should <em>not exercise</em> the jurisdiction <em>it has</em>, and is consequently not a jurisdictional
objection which warrants the admiralty writ to be <em>set
aside</em> under O 12 r 7 of the Rules of Court. It may however
constitute a <em>substantive</em> objection
to be placed for consideration under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court.
As Singapore Tankers admits in the ground stated in the face of
its summons, “[t]he suit is not competent <em>as
to the merits</em> of the Plaintiff’s claim because it has
been brought in breach of [the] arbitration agreement” [emphasis
added]. The distinction drawn by the court in <em>The “Bunga
Melati 5”</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1017 between a jurisdictional
challenge which properly belongs to an application brought under
O 12 r 7, and a non-jurisdictional challenge which belongs to an
application under O 18 r 19, is not disputed by counsel for Singapore
Tankers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There
being no basis for a jurisdictional challenge under O 12 r 7, I move
on to consider the application to strike out the writ under O 18
r 19.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the writ should be struck
out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As
aforementioned, the true purport of the position taken by Singapore
Tankers is that Portigon’s claim in court should properly be the subject
matter of the arbitral proceedings between Portigon and Oceanic such
that the time bar under the Hague-Visby Rules applies. Counsel for Singapore
Tankers relied upon the decision of the English Commercial Court
in <em>Thyssen Inc v Calypso Shipping Corporation</em> SA
[2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 243 (“<em>Thyssen</em>”)
in support of this position. It was submitted that the decision,
in particular the following pronouncements of Steel J (at [22]),
is authority for the principle that an action which has been stayed
in favour of arbitration will not constitute a “competent suit”
for the purposes of Article III rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…where, as here, the [court] suit is brought
in breach of an arbitration clause, the Courts do not regard that
as suit for the purposes of the rule [6 of the Hague-Visby Rules]
(unless of course there is no application for a stay). … It is not
enough for the correct claimant to commence proceedings before a competent
Court against the correct defendant. The proceeding must remain valid
and effective at the time when the carrier seeks to rely on r. 6
in the second set of [arbitral] proceedings. Thus where the [court]
action has been … stayed by reason of the invocation of an arbitration
clause, [the] suit has not been brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
decision however does not go very far in supporting Singapore Tankers’
position. The court in <em>Thyssen</em> found
that the claimant in an arbitration could not successfully prevent
its arbitral claim from being time barred under Article III rule
6 of the Hague-Visby Rules from the mere fact that it had commenced
court proceedings against the respondent-defendant within time.
This was because the court action had been stayed in favour of arbitration
with the result that arbitration proceedings were commenced against
the respondent-defendant out of time. There were no pronouncements
made by that court that a similar claim brought within time by the
same plaintiff in court against a party who may be joined to the arbitral
proceedings would as a result be rendered an “incompetent suit” and
consequently be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
any event, taking the case put forth by Singapore Tankers at its best, <em>even if</em> the suit brought against Singapore
Tankers is not a competent one <em>because</em> it
was brought in breach of the arbitration agreement between Portigon
and Oceanic, there is no authority submitted by Singapore Tankers
to show why the <em>remedy</em> for such
a situation would be to <em>strike out</em> the
writ filed in court. Surely, such a remedy is inconsistent with
the <em>staying</em> of court actions (as
opposed to striking out) when the actions were found to have been
brought in breach of arbitration agreements. In fact, it is implicit in
Singapore Tankers’ reliance on <em>Thyssen</em> that
Portigon’s claim against Singapore Tankers should, just like the
claim against Oceanic, be <em>stayed</em> in favour
of arbitration such that the time bar may be applicable, as opposed
to it being struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the vessel should be
released</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Singapore
Tankers applied in the alternative for the vessel to be released.
It was alleged that counsel for Portigon had failed to disclose
to the court which granted the arrest that the same law firm was
acting for Portigon and the liquidators of Onsys. As Oceanic had
time sub-chartered the vessel to Onsys, it would have documents
which could evidence the existence of the time charterparty which
contains the arbitration agreement under which the Hague-Visby time
bar defence was applicable. It was also alleged that Portigon should
have disclosed the correspondence between Portigon and Onsys relating
to the circumstances behind the misdelivery of the cargo as well
as the vessel’s chartering arrangements. Singapore Tankers also
take the position that Portigon should have disclosed the fact that
it did not request such further documents from Onsys’ liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     To
my mind, the alleged non-disclosure is not relevant because it was undisputed
that counsel for Portigon had disclosed to the court the time bar defence
under the Hague-Visby Rules. The documents and correspondence exchanged
between Portigon’s and Oceanic’s solicitors which set out Oceanic’s
position on the existence of the time charterparty and the time bar
defence were disclosed, and counsel for Portigon had even made submissions
at the hearing for the arrest of the vessel on why the action should
not be stayed even assuming if the time charterparty did exist. Singapore
Tankers did not specify what exactly were the correspondence between
Portigon and Onsys which were undisclosed, nor the basis in which
such documents can reasonably be assumed to exist. In addition,
the alleged failure to disclose something which did not happen,
or a non-event, appears to be quite an unusual ground for the application;
it was not explained how the fact that Portigon did not request
further documents from Onsys’ liquidators would amount to a material
fact which ought to be disclosed. The documents which Portigon failed
to request were not specified, and it was not shown that such documents
exists in the first place. In any event, the position taken by Singapore
Tankers could no longer be maintained given its own concession that
there is no suggestion that the lawyers acting for Portigon would
have access to the documents in the hands of the Onsys’ liquidators,
even if the lawyers acting for the latter are from the same firm
(Magelssen’s first affidavit at paragraph [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Singapore Tankers should
be joined to the arbitral proceedings between Portigon and Oceanic</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The basis for ordering a joinder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     With
the striking out and setting aside application dismissed, the court
action against Singapore Tankers subsists alongside the arbitral proceedings
between Portigon and Oceanic. As Portigon makes the same claims
based on the same causes of action against both Oceanic and Singapore
Tankers upon on the same set of factual matrix, efficiencies could
be gained if the disputes are consolidated in a single adjudication setting,
and this has the benefit of preventing inconsistent decisions. This presents
an obvious issue of whether the court could on its own motion order
that Singapore Tankers be joined to the arbitral proceedings. This court
has on 12 November 2013 queried counsel on whether Singapore Tankers
may be joined as a party to the arbitration proceedings in the event where
Portigon’s action against Oceanic is stayed in favour of arbitration. Counsel
for Portigon highlighted the fact that Singapore Tankers did not seek
a stay of the court action, and subsequently submitted that the
Court of Appeal had in the recent decision in <em>PT
First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK)
v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</em> [2013]
SGCA 57 (“<em>Astro</em>”) emphasized that any
notion of forced joinder would impinge upon party autonomy and confidentiality
(see written submissions dated 4 December 2013 at [14]). Counsel
for Singapore Tankers takes the position that <em>Astro</em> is
not relevant to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
relevant question before the Court of Appeal in <em>Astro</em> was whether
the arbitral tribunal had correctly construed rule 24(b) of the
2007 Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules as a rule
which parties have agreed to confer upon the tribunal the power
to order parties who are not parties to the arbitration agreement
to be joined to an existing arbitration reference. The Court of
Appeal did not accept the arbitral tribunal’s construction of the
rule (at [181] and [188]) :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A tribunal cannot extend its jurisdiction
to disputes over which it has no jurisdiction by simply purporting
to rely on r 24. To this extent we accept Mr Landau’s argument that
r 24(b) acts as a procedural power, rather than a means for a tribunal
to extend its jurisdiction. It would otherwise be a portal through
which a tribunal could exercise unlimited jurisdiction over any dispute
which any non-party could have with the parties to the arbitration reference.
We do not think that any set of arbitration rules, unless explicitly stated
otherwise (and even then, we would reserve our views), could provide for
such unlimited jurisdiction. The terms of any arbitration reference
must ultimately lie within the limits described by the arbitration
agreement, save to the extent that it might be extended with the
explicit consent of all the parties. In our judgment, the general
position must be that the arbitration agreement sets the parameters
of the tribunal’s jurisdiction. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The forced joinder of non-parties is also
a major derogation from the principle of party autonomy, which is
of foundational importance because all arbitrations must proceed <em>in limine</em> from an agreement to arbitrate.
Forced joinders carve out a significant exception to this by compelling
an arbitration with other persons with whom the parties had not
specifically agreed to arbitrate. Even where these other persons
are connected to the subject matter of the arbitration, there has
been no election of arbitration as the specific dispute resolution
mechanism with those other persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     While
the question of when a court may order a joinder was not placed
before the Court of Appeal in <em>Astro</em>,
the judicial philosophy on according due significance to the principle
of party autonomy would apply with no less compelling force. As
such, while a court may be acutely aware of the legitimate advantages
and procedural efficiencies which would be gained with a forced
joinder, it should nevertheless be borne in mind that these considerations
in and of themselves do not provide the court with <em>the authority</em> to
derogate from the principle of party autonomy in the absence of
any express statutory provisions to the effect. Given that the IAA
is silent on the issue of joinder, this court is guided by the spirit
behind the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration
(“Model Law”), which is given the force of law via section 3 of
the IAA. Section 4 of the IAA allows this court to refer to the <em>travaux préparatoires</em> when interpreting
the Model Law, and it is that which I turn my attention to. The drafters
considered the question of whether the Model Law should contain provisions
relating to joinder (<em>Second Secretariat Note,
Possible Features of a Model Law: Questions for Discussion, A/CN.9/WG.II/WP.35
(1 December 1981)</em>; H. Holtzmann &amp; J. Neuhaus, <em>A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary</em> 311
(2013) (“<em>Holtzmann &amp; Neuhaus</em>”)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Should the model law deal with problems
of consolidation in multi-party disputes (e.g. whether consolidation
agreements should be given effect, or whether even without such
agreements consolidation might be ordered)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
drafters of the Model Law considered the question and took the following
position (<em>First Working Group Report A/CN.9/216
(23 March 1982); Holtzmann &amp; Neuhaus</em> at 312):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was general agreement that the model
law should not deal with problems of consolidation in multi-party
disputes. <em>While it was agreed that parties
had the freedom to conclude consolidation agreements if they so
wished</em>, the Working Group was of the view that there
was no real need to include a provision on consolidation in the
model law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     To
the drafters, it was not necessary to provide any provisions because parties
had the freedom to form their own agreements if they so wished to have
a joinder (see Julian D M Lew QC, Loukas A Mistelis, Stefan M Kröll, <em>Comparative International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Kluwer
Law International, 2003), at para 16-47).  In so far as the only
premise in which a joinder will take place under the framework envisaged
by the drafters of the Model Law is upon the agreement of parties; <em>consent</em> is, in the minds of the drafters,
a <em>necessary condition</em> for there
to be a joinder. This must necessarily be so, for if there does
not exist an agreement to arbitrate, this could be a ground for
refusal of recognition and enforcement under Art 36(1)(a)(i) (or
section 31(2)(b) of the IAA and Art V(1)(a) of the 1958 Convention
on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“the
New York Convention”)). In addition, where a person is joined without
the consent of the parties, the resulting arbitral award could be
refused recognition and enforcement for having dealt with a dispute
not contemplated within the terms of the submissions to arbitration,
under Art 36(1)(a)(iii) (or section 31(2)(d) of the IAA and Art
V(1)(c) of the New York Convention). Where the composition of the
arbitral tribunal is not in accordance with the agreement of the
parties, including the party joined, the award given by a tribunal
in which that party had no say in appointing may be refused recognition
and enforcement, under Art 36(1)(a)(iv) (or section 31(2)(e) of
the IAA and Art V(1)(d) of the New York Convention).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
rationale of the approach adopted by the drafters of the Model Law
should be self-evident. Consent is the very foundation of arbitration, without
which an arbitral tribunal’s authority to hear and determine the dispute
is non-existent. If a court orders a joinder notwithstanding the
lack of consent, it would force a party to bring its dispute to
be adjudicated by a forum which has no jurisdiction to decide the
matter from which no enforceable award could be rendered. More fundamentally,
the non-consenting party would be denied its right to access the
courts when it has not waived its right to do so in the form of
an arbitration agreement. As such, in adherence with the spirit
of the Model Law and the New York Convention, a court has the power
to order a joinder only with the parties’ consent. The exercise
of such power is a function of the basic requirement to recognize
and give effect to arbitration agreements entrenched in section 6
of the IAA, Art 8 of the Model Law, and Art II(1) of the New York Convention,
such that a party is joined to an arbitration pursuant to an agreement
to arbitrate formed amongst parties (See generally Gary Born, <em>International Arbitration: Law and Practice Vol I</em> (Kluwer
Law International, 2012), p 223). This is either where:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
party sought to be joined is found to be a contracting party to
the arbitration agreement; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     parties
to the arbitration agreement have consented to extend the agreement
to a person who was not a party to the agreement but who accepts
to be bound by it, with such consent forming an agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For
the latter situation, parties to the arbitration agreement may have agreed
via the rules of the relevant arbitral institution to the procedural mechanism
and criteria in which the consent will be given to join a person who
is not a party to the arbitration agreement.  In either event, consent
is a necessary condition for a joinder, save perhaps for the unique
situation where parties to the arbitration agreement have unequivocally
agreed that one or all of the parties to the arbitration agreement
need not consent to the joinder of persons who are not parties to
the arbitration agreement (see e.g., Art 4 of the Swiss Rules of
International Arbitration; and even then, the extent and nature
of the precise agreement should be carefully examined to determine
the true intention of the parties; see <em>Astro</em> at
[181]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The issue of joinder in the
present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As
Singapore Tankers has taken the position that that it is <em>not</em> a party to the contract of carriage
which incorporates the arbitration agreement, the proper analysis
here would not be on how Singapore Tankers may be found to be a
contracting party to an arbitration agreement (these relate to situations
 concerning incorporation of the arbitration agreement; the absence
of separate corporate personality; or agency (See William W. Park, <em>Non-Signatories and International Contracts: An Arbitrator’s
Dilemma</em>, in <em>Multiple Party Actions
in International Arbitration</em>, Oxford 2009) (“<em>William Park</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Instead,
the issue in the present case is whether the parties to the arbitration
agreement, i.e, Portigon and Oceanic, have consented to extend the
agreement to Singapore Tankers, and whether it accepts to be bound
by the arbitration agreement, thus forming an agreement to arbitrate
amongst the parties. Counsel for Portigon takes the position that
neither Portigon nor Singapore Tankers have consented to the joinder
of Singapore Tankers to the arbitration between Portigon and Oceanic
(see plaintiff’s written submissions dated 4 December 2013 at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Determining if a person is a
party to an agreement to arbitrate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Whether
a person is a party to an agreement to arbitrate is a fact-intensive
question which has to be determined in accordance with the law applicable
to decide who are the persons mandated to have their disputes resolved
by arbitration instead of the court process, i.e, the <em>lex arbitri</em> of the forum seized of the
stay or joinder application. In this regard, both section 2A of
the IAA and Art II(7) of the Model law provide a broad definition
of an arbitration agreement as an “agreement by the parties to submit
to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which
may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship,
whether contractual or not”; and an arbitration agreement may be
in the form of an arbitration clause or in a contract or in the
form of a separate agreement, but an arbitration agreement shall
be in writing. Reference should also be made to Art II(1) of the
New York Convention, given that any joinder may have an impact on
the enforceability of an award in other jurisdictions. That provision
refers to “an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake
to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or
which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether
contractual or not, concerning a subject-matter capable of settlement
by arbitration”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In
line with the position adopted by the Court of Appeal in  <em>International Research Corp PLC v Lufthansa Systems
Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014] 1 SLR 130 (“<em>International Research Corp</em>”), which referred
to the approach in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore)
Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design and &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
3 SLR(R) 1029,  the court should have regard to the context and <em>objective circumstances</em> to ascertain the
parties’ <em>objective</em> intentions in
determining the question of whether a person is a party to an agreement
to arbitrate.  The Court of Appeal in <em>International
Research Corp</em> adopted this contextual approach to determine the
question of whether a third person would be bound by an arbitration agreement
found in a contract between two parties, where the third person had
entered into a supplemental agreement with the two original contracting
parties.  On a contextual interpretation of the agreements, the Court
of Appeal found that it was not the parties’ intention for the arbitration
agreement to be incorporated as part of the supplemental agreement,
and the third person was accordingly not bound by the arbitration
agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It
would also be useful to refer to international norms derived from cross-jurisdictional
cases with similar factual matrix which may be instructive in determining
whether a person is a party to an agreement to arbitrate for the
purposes of ordering a joinder, given the international character
of the Model Law and New York Convention. In this regard, there are
decisions which illustrate the court’s willingness to determine
from the parties’ conduct and objective circumstances the true intentions
of the parties, such as the case of <em>Southern
Illinois Beverage v. Hansen Beverage Co.</em>, 2007 WL 3046273
(S.D. Ill. 2007), which involves an arbitration agreement in a principal
distributorship contract for beverage distribution between the manufacturer
and the principal distributor. There was no arbitration agreement
in the sub-distributorship contract. The sub-distributor commenced
a court action against the manufacturer for alleged sale of goods
to third parties in breach of its obligations under the principal distributorship
contract. The court found that the sub-distributor claimant could
not obviate arbitration given that its claims were “fundamentally rooted
in and dependent on [the] rights and conditions” of the principal contract,
and that it could not disavow the arbitration agreement found in the
principal contract given that it had sought to benefit directly
under that contract. The court asserted the following principle:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in the arbitration context, a party may
be estopped from asserting that an arbitration clause contained
in a particular document is inapplicable when that same party simultaneously
claims the direct benefit of that contract. This estoppel doctrine
exists to prevent a litigant from unfairly receiving the benefit
of a contract while at the same time repudiating what it believes
to be a disadvantage in the contract, namely the contractual arbitration
provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Significantly,
the court took the position that it would be manifestly inequitable
to permit a plaintiff to both claim that a defendant is liable for its
failure to perform contractual duties under an agreement containing
an arbitration clause, and at the same time, seek to avoid arbitration
of claims which fell clearly within the ambit of that arbitration
clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Reference
can also be made to the case of <em>Sunkist Soft
Drinks v Sunkist Growers</em>, 10 F.3d 753 (11th Cir. 1993).
General Cinema Corporation (“GCC”) had obtained the contractual
right from Sunkist Growers Inc (“Sunkist”) to market and sell the
orange soda under the “Sunkist” brand name. GCC created a wholly
owned subsidiary known as Sunkist Soft Drinks (“SSD”) to produce
and market the soda. Sunkist and SSD entered into a license agreement
which provided a detailed framework for the marketing and sale of
the soda, and the license agreement included an arbitration agreement.
SSD was subsequently bought by a company, Del Monte Corporation
(“Del Monte”). Sunkist commenced a court action against Del Monte
for disputes arising from the license agreement. Del Monte sought
to compel arbitration instead by relying on the arbitration agreement,
but Sunkist argued that the dispute should not be arbitrated as Del
Monte was not a party to the arbitration agreement. The court held that,
even though Del Monte was not formally a party to the arbitration agreement,
Sunkist was estopped from avoiding arbitration given that the basis
of Del Monte’s cause of action lies in the license agreement itself
in which the arbitration agreement was found, and in view that SSD
had practically lost its independent operating status and had become
a part of Del Monte since SSD was bought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     
          <em>Fluor Daniel Intercontinental, Inc. v. General Electric
Co., Inc</em>, No. 98-Civ. 7181 (WHP) 1999 WL 637236 (S.D.N.Y.
1999) is a case which involves supply and services agreements signed
between two groups of companies to construct a power plant in Saudi
Arabia. Some members of each group of companies concluded agreements
which contained arbitration agreements, while other members of each
group had not. The claimants deliberately chose to commence court
proceedings against the members of the defendant group of companies
which omitted to conclude agreements containing the arbitration
agreements, alleging that the agreements had been induced through
misrepresentations. The court ordered that the dispute be referred
to arbitration, on the ground that the claimants was not allowed
to “rely on the contract when it works to their advantage…but then repudiate
the contract and its arbitration clause when they believe it works against
them”. The principle in this decision is described by a commentator as
follows, “a signatory to an arbitration clause will be precluded
from refusing to arbitrate with a non-signatory when the essence
of the dispute is intertwined with, or derived from, the contract
containing the arbitration clause” (<em>William
Park</em> at para 1.49).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Société Alcatel Business Systems (ABS), Société Alcatel
Micro Electronics (AME) et Société AGF v Amkor Technology et al,
Cass 1e civ.</em>, Mar. 27, 2007, JCP [2007] I 168, No. 11,
a Belgian company had contracted to purchase electronic chip components
from an American corporation, which obtained its supplies from a
Korean supplier. The contract between the Belgian company and the
American corporation contained an arbitration agreement. On the
request of the Belgian company, the Korean supplier would provide
supplies to subsidiaries of the American corporation based in France
as this arrangement was more convenient to the Belgian company.
The company commenced a court action against the American corporation
and its subsidiaries based in France for damages arising from defective
chips. The <em>Cour de cassation</em> held
that the subsidiaries of the American corporation could rely on
the arbitration agreement; this was because the Belgian company
had, by accepting the subsidiaries into the supply arrangement,
conferred upon them the benefit of the arbitration clause signed
with their parent company, and at the same time, the subsidiaries
have accepted to be bound by the arbitration agreement by accepting
to partake in the supply arrangement (<em>William Park</em> at
para 1.55).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
cases above illustrate the principle that where the objective circumstances
and parties’ conduct reveal that the parties to the arbitration agreement
have consented to extend the agreement to a third person who is not
a party to the agreement, and that third person has shown by its conduct
to accept to be bound by the agreement, parties can be found to have
impliedly consented to form an agreement to arbitrate where this
has been clearly and unequivocally shown be the parties’ objective
intention. The concept of a <em>purely</em> implied
agreement is however anathema to the requirement for a written arbitration
agreement prescribed in the IAA, Model Law, and the New York Convention
(as shown in the case of <em>Javor v Fusion-Crete</em>,
Inc., XXIX Y.B. Com. Arb. P 596 (2004) (Sup. Ct. Brit. Col. 2003),
where an arbitral award rendered against a party found to be an “alter
ego” of a signatory to the arbitration agreement was refused enforcement
under Art II(2) of the New York Convention for having failed to
satisfy the requirement for a written arbitration agreement).  As
can be seen from the case decisions considered, this requirement
necessitates there to be at least a <em>written</em> arbitration
agreement from which parties’ implied consent can be determined.
In particular, implied consent is determined from the parties’ intention
to extend the written arbitration agreement to a non-party who accepts
to be bound by it (see also the decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme
Court in <em>X.S.A.L., Y.S.A.L. &amp; A v. Z, SARL</em> (16
October 2003)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Parties’ objective intention
in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The
facts of the present case are analogous to those in the cases discussed
above. It appears that the parties in the present case have <em>impliedly</em> consented to have the dispute
resolved before an arbitral tribunal. This court has in <em>The “Titan Unity”</em> found that there exists
a written arbitration agreement between Portigon and Oceanic (“the
arbitration agreement”). As alluded to above at [11] and [12], Singapore
Tankers has by its own conduct accepted to be bound by the arbitration
agreement, as it attempts to avail itself to the benefit of the
arbitration agreement as well as the time bar applicable to the
bills of lading which incorporates the arbitration agreement. While
Portigon had disputed the existence of the arbitration agreement
(see <em>The “Titan Unity”</em> at [7]),
Oceanic has taken the same position as Singapore Tankers that the
arbitration agreement did indeed exist. As for Portigon, it is evident
that the very basis of its cause of action against Singapore Tankers
lies in the contract in which the arbitration agreement is found.
Portigon has by its own admission in its pleadings, always regarded
Singapore Tankers as the contractual carrier as the bills of lading
had carried the stamp of Singapore Tankers. This was, as pleaded
by Portigon, a “clear and unequivocal representation” that Singapore
Tankers <em>was the contractual carrier</em> under
the bills of lading (see paragraph 6 of the statement of claim filed
on 20 August 2013).  In fact, Portigon claims <em>in
the main</em> against Singapore Tankers that it was obligated to
deliver the cargo in accordance with the contract of carriage contained
in the bills of lading and had breached the contract by delivering
the cargo without presentation of the bills of lading; the same
claims were made against Oceanic <em>in the alternative</em> (see
paragraphs [7] to [12] of the statement of claim filed on 20 August
2013).  Given that Portigon is claiming against Singapore Tankers
as the contractual carrier based on the contract of carriage contained
in the bills of lading which incorporates the arbitration agreement
mandating that any disputes arising out of the contract be resolved
by arbitration, it would not lie in the mouth of Portigon to say
that it did not consent to have its claim against Singapore Tankers
arbitrated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This
is reinforced by the fact that Portigon had gone as far as to plead that
Oceanic and Singapore Tankers are related companies controlled by one
Tsoi Tin Chu and Tsoi’s associates (see paragraph [6(f)] of the statement
of claim filed on 20 August 2013]. Portigon submitted evidence to
support this, by alleging that Tsoi is the sole director and shareholder
of Oceanic, and that Singapore Tankers is a subsidiary of Titan
Ocean (the managers of the vessel). The sole shareholder of Titan
Ocean is, according to Portigon, a company which is owned by the
Titan Group, where 40.9% shares of Titan Group is owned by Titan
Oil. Tsoi and his wife, it was alleged, hold 100% of the shares
in Titan Oil. In addition, Portigon presented further evidence which
led it to conclude that “Singapore Tankers is nothing more than
[an] investment vehicle nestled in this web of corporate entitled
controlled by Tsoi” (see pages 34 and 35 of the plaintiff’s written
submissions dated 20 August 2013). Taking these allegations to their
logical conclusion and in view that Portigon had proceeded with
the same cause of action against both Singapore Tankers and Oceanic
based on the same contractual obligations arising from the same
contract in which the arbitration agreement is found, it would appear
that Portigon’s <em>objective</em> intention
is to have the claim against Singapore Tankers arbitrated just as
it did for the claim against Oceanic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Express agreement on mechanism
for joinder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Nevertheless,
it is not insignificant that the parties to the arbitration agreement,
Portigon and Oceanic, have expressly agreed upon a mechanism to
join a person who is not a party to the arbitration agreement, under
Rule 32.2 of the SCMA Rules, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the parties so agree, the Tribunal shall
also have the power to add other parties (with their consent) to
be joined in the arbitration and make a single Final Award determining
all disputes between them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In
view that the parties have expressly agreed upon a mechanism in the
arbitral rules to join a person who is not a party to the arbitration agreement,
the court should defer any views it has on the parties’ implied consent
to joinder, to the arbitral tribunal’s determination of its own jurisdiction
pursuant to that mechanism. This must be so if party autonomy is
to be respected, and this would also be consistent with the principle
of <em>Kompetenz-Kompetenz</em> entrenched
in Art 16 of the Model Law, which confers upon the arbitral tribunal
the power to determine if it has jurisdiction to hear the claim
brought by Portigon against Singapore Tankers. It could be that <em>express consent</em> is required under the
mechanism agreed upon by parties to the arbitration agreement, in
which case implied consent would in any event not be a justifiable
criteria for this court to order a joinder, but that would remain
a question which the arbitral tribunal has the prerogative to determine
in its interpretation of what consent entails under Rule 32.2 of
the SCMA Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It
could very well be that with this approach, a court would in practice seldom
order a person to be joined to arbitral proceedings based on implied consent,
given that many arbitral rules which arbitrants subscribe to provide
mechanisms for joinder. This is especially so where the applicable arbitral
rules provide for the requirement of <em>written
consent</em> for joinder (see e.g., 1998 London Court of International
Arbitration Rules (“LCIA rules”), Art 22.1(h)). The obvious difficulty
with this approach in the present case is that the arbitral tribunal
would have necessarily been appointed without the say of Singapore
Tankers by the time in which a decision has been made by the tribunal
on whether it should be joined to the arbitration. As alluded to at
[23] above, this may have an effect on the enforceability of the
award rendered. The concern is illustrated in the decision of <em>Siemens AG and BKMI Industrieanlagen GmbH v Dutco
Construction Co.</em>, 119 J.D.I. (Clunet) 707 (French Cour
de cassation civ lre)(1992), where the French <em>Cour
de cassation</em> set aside an award rendered by an arbitral
tribunal which was constituted without the agreement of the respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
difficulty highlighted is however not an intractable one. The right of
an arbitrant to appoint its own arbitrator has been questioned (see
e.g., Professor Jan Paulsson, <em>Moral Hazard
in International Dispute Resolution</em>, TDM 2 (2011)) and
has certainly been watered down in practice given the arbitrants’
subscription to innovative rules of arbitral institutions, such
as those which allow an arbitrant to consent to waive its right
to appoint an arbitrator under prescribed circumstances (see Art
2.3 and 11.2 of the LCIA Rules). Where there is a single claimant
but multiple respondents, there are rules which prescribe that the
respondents shall jointly nominate an arbitrator, with the arbitrator
being appointed by the arbitral institution if the respondents fail
to do so (see International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration
2012, Art 12(6)). There are even rules which allow all parties to
the arbitration to consent to waive their right to appoint an arbitral
tribunal when a person is joined to an arbitration, such that the arbitral
tribunal shall be appointed by the arbitral institution instead,
and those which confer upon the arbitral institution the power to
revoke the appointment of any arbitrators upon the addition of a
party with the replacement tribunal appointed by the institution
(see Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Administered Arbitration
Rules 2013, Art 27.11). In the present case, it could be that the
person to be joined would be deemed to have agreed to the composition
of the tribunal from the fact that it wishes to be joined notwithstanding
the fact that an arbitral tribunal has already been appointed, but
that is a question to be agreed amongst the arbitrants with the
possible assistance of the arbitral tribunal and institution in
the construction and administration of the SCMA Rules. It should ultimately
be borne in mind that Art V(1)(d) of the New York Convention does
not prescribe that the tribunal must be appointed by the arbitrants,
but only that the composition of the arbitral tribunal be made in
accordance with the agreement of the parties; and as modernised
arbitral rules have more than capably shown, an arbitrant may <em>agree</em> to a tribunal’s composition without
having appointed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For
the reasons provided above, the application to set aside and to strike
out the writ is dismissed with costs. Parties will be heard on costs.
I will give time for parties to consider whether they would like
to have a joint discussion with a view to add Singapore Tankers
as a party to the arbitral proceedings, as well as for Singapore
Tankers to consider whether it wishes to be joined to the arbitral
proceedings and if so, what necessary recourse it ought to seek
before arbitral tribunal. For these purposes, it would be good if
counsel for parties have in mind the procedural efficiencies that
may be gained with a joinder and the potential costs consequences
that may result with concurrent court and arbitral proceedings without
a joinder. Consequently, the time for Singapore Tankers to file
and serve its defence is extended to 4 March 2014. Parties are to
attend a pre-trial conference on a date to be fixed to update the
court on the positions taken by parties.</p>
