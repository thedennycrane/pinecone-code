<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This originating summons
                    (“the present OS”) is an <em>ex
                        parte</em> application made by Mr Zero
                    Geraldo Mario Nalpon (“the Applicant”), an
                    advocate and solicitor, under s 82A(5) of the Legal
                    Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
                    LPA”) for leave for an investigation to be made into
                    his complaint of misconduct against
                    Ms Nor’Ashikin binte Samdin (“the
                    DPP”), a Legal Service Officer (“LSO”)
                    who was, at the relevant time, designated as a Deputy Public
                    Prosecutor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The complaint of misconduct
                    arose out of the trial in the District Court (“the
                    District Court trial”) of the Applicant’s
                    client, Ezmiwardi bin Kanan (“the Accused”),
                    on two charges of criminal breach of trust, namely, District
                    Arrest Case (“DAC”) No 18210 of 2009 and
                    DAC No 18211 of 2009 (referred to hereafter as
                    “the 1st Charge” and “the 2nd
                    Charge” respectively). A third charge, DAC
                    No 18212 of 2009, was stood down. At the end of the
                    District Court trial, the district judge (“the
                    DJ”) convicted the Accused of the 1st Charge, but
                    acquitted him of the 2nd Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In support of the present
                    OS, the Applicant filed an affidavit dated 31 January
                    2012 (“the Applicant’s 31/1/2012
                    affidavit”) setting out the specific allegations of
                    misconduct against the DPP. The present OS and the
                    Applicant’s 31/1/2012 affidavit were not served on the
                    DPP. However, she came to know about the application and
                    obtained copies of these two documents from the Supreme
                    Court Registry. The DPP thereupon applied to me for leave to
                    be heard at the hearing of the present OS. In support of her
                    application, the DPP filed an affidavit dated 9 March
                    2012 exhibiting (<em>inter alia</em>)
                    the following documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     a copy of the
                        Applicant’s affidavit filed on 15 August 2011
                        (“the Applicant’s 15/8/2011
                        affidavit”) in support of Criminal Motion
                        No 58 of 2011 (“CM 58/2011”),
                        which was the Applicant’s application for leave
                        for a document to be admitted in the Accused’s
                        appeal (<em>viz</em>,
                        Magistrate’s Appeal No 401 of 2010
                        (“MA 401/2010”)) against his
                        conviction of the 1st Charge by the
                    DJ;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     a copy of the DPP’s affidavit dated
                        2 November 2011 filed in
                    CM 58/2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     a copy of the affidavit of Senior
                        Station Inspector Yong Chok Choon
                        (“PW10”) dated 4 November 2011 filed
                        in CM 58/2011; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     a certified transcript of the
                        proceedings in MA 401/2010 and CM 58/2011,
                        which were heard together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Initially, I was minded to
                    grant the DPP leave to be heard, but subsequently, I decided
                    to hear the present OS on an <em>ex
                        parte</em> basis as I was (perhaps overly)
                    concerned that any decision which I made against the DPP at
                    an <em>inter partes</em> hearing, in
                    the event of my allowing the Applicant’s application
                    in the present OS, might influence the subsequent
                    disciplinary proceedings before a Disciplinary Tribunal.
                    Accordingly, I heard the present OS on an <em>ex parte</em> basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory framework for disciplinary
                proceedings against LSOs</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before I consider the merits
                    of the present OS, it is necessary that I examine the
                    statutory framework governing the conduct of LSOs in their
                    professional work in court and out of court. All LSOs are
                    officers of the court when they act in any court
                    proceedings; they are also officers of the court if they
                    have been admitted as advocates and solicitors. As such,
                    they are subject to the control of the Supreme Court, and,
                    like all other officers of the court, they are liable to be
                    disciplined and punished under the LPA for misconduct
                    committed in Singapore or elsewhere. In the case of LSOs (as
                    well as non-practising lawyers who have been admitted as
                    advocates and solicitors), the statutory regime is set out
                    in s 82A of the LPA. The provisions relevant to the
                    present OS are as follows:</p>

                    supporting affidavit for the present OS (<em>viz</em>, the Applicant’s 31/1/2012
                    affidavit mentioned at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above) were sufficient in law to make
                    out such a case. In the circumstances, I shall have to
                    embark on an <em>ex parte</em>
                    examination of the legal principles to determine what the
                    requirements of “a prima facie case” are under
                    s 82A(6) of the LPA in order to decide whether the
                    present OS is a proper case for granting leave for an
                    investigation into the alleged misconduct of the
                DPP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The concept of “a
                    prima facie case” has been applied by Singapore and
                    Malaysian courts (and their predecessors) in other contexts
                    in both civil and criminal proceedings. For example, in
                        <em>Gan </em><em>Soo
                        Swee and another v Ramoo</em>
                    [1968–1970] SLR(R) 324, a civil case, Wee
                    Chong Jin CJ defined the expression to mean the
                    following (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]e have here a case where the plaintiff was
                        alleging that either the lorry driver or the taxi driver
                        or both were responsible for the accident. He had
                        therefore to prove a state of facts from which the
                        reasonable inference to be drawn was that <em>prima facie</em> one if not both
                        drivers had been negligent before he is entitled to call
                        on both defendants for an answer. To make a <em>prima facie</em> case he must prove
                        facts from which in the absence of an explanation
                        liability could properly be inferred. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The concept of “a
                    prima facie case” has also been extensively used in
                    criminal proceedings as the basis for the court’s
                    decision on whether or not to call on the accused to enter
                    his defence at the close of the Prosecution’s case. An
                    early example is <em>Public Prosecutor v Chin
                        Yoke</em> [1940] MLJ 47
                        (“<em>Chin
                    Yoke</em>”), where
                    Gordon-Smith Ag JA, in examining the scope of
                        s 173(<em>f</em>) of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 6) of the Federated Malay
                    States, held (at 48–49) that at the close of the
                    Prosecution’s case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is then that it is the duty of the Magistrate or
                        Judge to consider the evidence already led and decide
                        whether or not to call on the accused for his defence,
                        and the question arises what is a <em>prima facie</em> case? …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>[I]t does not follow, in my opinion,
                            that the Magistrate or Judge must necessarily accept
                            the whole of the evidence for the prosecution at its
                            face value</em>. There may be good grounds for
                        rejecting some part, or all of it and, therefore, it is
                        necessary to weigh up this evidence and on so doing one
                        may be satisfied that, <em>if
                            unrebutted</em>, it would warrant the
                        accused’s conviction. In such case the accused is
                        then called upon to answer the <em>prima
                            facie</em> case which has thus been made out
                        against him. If, however, on the other hand, after
                        weighing up such evidence for the prosecution one is
                        satisfied that it would be wholly unsafe to convict upon
                        such evidence standing alone, then no <em>prima </em><em>facie
                            case</em> has been made out and the accused
                        should not be called on for his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage sets out a number of
                    principles:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the court
                        must consider the Prosecution’s evidence as it
                        stands at the close of the Prosecution’s case. If
                        that evidence as a whole (weighing up all the pluses and
                        the minuses) is sufficient, <em>if
                            unrebutted</em>, to warrant the
                        accused’s conviction, then a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made
                        out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     The hypothesis “if
                        unrebutted” (see <em>Chin
                            Yoke</em> at 48) refers to a case where the
                        accused, having been called on to enter his defence,
                        either: (i) declines to do so; or (ii) having
                        entered his defence, fails to adduce sufficient evidence
                        to rebut the Prosecution’s <em>prima facie</em> case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     The words
                        “would warrant” in the same context do not
                        mean that the court <em>must</em>
                        convict the accused if the Prosecution’s <em>prima facie</em> case has not been
                        unrebutted. The reason is that the burden is always on
                        the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable
                        doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v R Balasubramaniam</em>
                    [1948] MLJ 119 (“<em>R Balasubramaniam</em>”), where the
                    accused was charged under s 477A of the Penal Code (FMS
                    Cap 45) with wilful falsification of a hospital’s
                    account book by omitting to record 82 bedsheets in the
                    account book, Callow J said at the close of the
                    Prosecution’s case (at 120):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I must go further and consider whether even
                        if a <em>prima facie</em> case is
                        shown, such element of doubt is removed so as to sustain
                        a conviction if no more evidence is adduced. The
                            <em>onus</em> is on the
                        prosecution to prove the case and this burden never
                        shifts [citing <em>Public Prosecutor v
                            Lim Teong Seng</em> [1946] MLJ 108]. …
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After evaluating the strength of the
                    Prosecution’s evidence, Callow J held that the
                    Prosecution had not made out a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case as the evidence did not establish
                    an essential element of the offence charged (at 122):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The accused made a terrible mess of the
                        bedsheet entries and if it had been shown that he had
                        done this after Dr Sabaratnam’s investigation
                        [Dr Sabaratnam being one of the prosecution
                        witnesses] had commenced an intent to defraud would be a
                        reasonable inference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But does the evidence for the prosecution point
                        irresistibly to wilful fraud? The fact that this book is
                        incorrect, ill-kept or misleading is not enough; there
                        must be conscious determination to defraud as
                        distinguished from ignorant incompetency … It is
                        a question of fact for me to decide on the evidence
                        before me; I am unable to allow the prosecution to
                        attempt to supplement, improve or confirm what may be
                        now a possible though doubtful case by whatever can be
                        elicited from the defence. The Crown case rests at the
                        close of the prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]ncompetence and inefficiency by the
                        accused is apparent, but on the evidence before me I
                        cannot be sure whether the accused in 1946 deliberately
                        falsified the book … or simply muddled it.
                        … I am by no means convinced of the innocence of
                        the accused, of which he might have satisfied me had he
                        elected to continue, but I do not find a case by the
                        prosecution which if unrebutted would warrant a
                        conviction, and I am bound in law to acquit the accused
                        of the charge. …</p>

                        (“<em>Hoh </em><em>Keh Peng</em>”), where the
                    appellant was convicted of being in possession of a
                    counterfeit seal with the intention of using it for the
                    purposes of committing forgery, the Court of Appeal of the
                    Malayan Union (comprising Willan CJ, Jobling and
                    Spenser-Wilkinson JJ), without using the terminology of
                    “a prima facie case”, appeared to have held
                    that at the close of the Prosecution’s case, the
                    evidence must be sufficient to prove the guilt of the
                    accused beyond a reasonable doubt; otherwise, the
                    Prosecution would not have made out a <em>prima facie</em> case. The court (<em>per</em> Spenser-Wilkinson J) said
                    (at 4):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Unless at the close of the case for the
                        prosecution the offence has been made out, there is no
                        justification for calling upon the accused for any
                        explanation whatever. There is a positive duty upon the
                        Judge under section 180 of the Criminal Procedure
                        Code to acquit the accused at the close of the
                        prosecution if he is not prepared then and there to
                        convict without hearing more. If an accused is called
                        upon for his defence he may be able to turn the balance
                        in his favour; but he should never be called upon for
                        his defence in a case of doubt so that he may convict
                        himself by supplementing a weak prosecution case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Similarly, in <em>Ong Kiang Kek v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1968–1970] SLR(R) 821 (“<em>Ong Kiang Kek</em>”), where the
                    appellant appealed against his conviction for murder, the
                    Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal (“the CCA”)
                    also did not use the terminology of “a prima facie
                    case”, but appeared to have adopted the same approach
                    as that of the Malayan Union Court of Appeal in <em>Hoh </em><em>Keh
                        Peng</em>. At [13]–[14] and [21]–[22] of <em>Ong Kiang

                            of the case for the Prosecution, to determine

                            driver’s seat and it was the appellant’s
                            hand holding the pistol from which the fatal shots

                            shots to have been fired by any one of three of the
                            four men in the Cortina car no case has been made
                            out against the appellant which if unrebutted would
                            warrant his conviction of murder <em>simpliciter</em>. Accordingly we are of
                            the opinion that the trial court was wrong in law to

                            or of murder <em>simpliciter</em> and the appellant should
                            have been acquitted at the close of the case for the

          <em>Ong
                        Kiang Kek</em> was a decision that was based on
                    s 177C of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 132,
                    1955 Rev Ed). The CCA’s approach in that case was
                    applied by the High Court in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Haw Tua </em><em>Tau</em> (unreported) (“<em>Haw Tua </em><em>Tau (HC)</em>”), which was based on
                    the substantively similar s 181(1) of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Rev Ed) (“the
                    1970 CPC”), and affirmed by the CCA in <em>Haw Tua </em><em>Tau

                    the Privy Council, whose written judgment was delivered by
                    Lord Diplock (see <em>Haw Tua

                    of the approach in <em>Ong Kiang
                        Kek</em> and held that the test applied by the CCA
                    in that case had been more rigorous than what was required
                    by the statutory words.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is useful to recall
                    Lord Diplock’s analysis of s 181(1) of the
                    1970 CPC, which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>181.</b>—(1) When
                        the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if
                        it finds that no case against the accused has been made
                        out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction,
                        shall record an order of acquittal, or if it does not so
                        find, shall call on the accused to enter on his
                        defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Diplock commented (at [14]–[15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    Section 188(1) [<em>sic</em>] states the conditions
                            precedent to the right and duty of the judge of
                            trial to call on the accused to enter on his
                            defence. It takes the form of a double negative: if
                            the court does <em>not</em>
                            find that <em>no</em> case
                            against the accused has been made out which, if
                            unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. For
                            reasons that are inherent in the adversarial
                            character of criminal trials under the common law
                            system, it does not place upon the court a positive
                            obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the
                            proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the
                            Prosecution has by then already satisfied it beyond
                            reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed
                            it would run counter to the concept of what is a
                            fair trial under that system to require the court to
                            do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    The crucial words in
                            s 188(1) are the words “if
                            unrebutted”, which make the question that the
                            court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one.
                            The Prosecution makes out a case against the accused
                            by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such
                            evidence that the words “if
                            unrebutted” refer. What they mean is that for
                            the purpose of reaching the decision called for by
                            s 188(1) the court must act on the
                            presumptions: (a) that all such evidence of
                            primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so
                            incredible that no reasonable person would accept it
                            as being true; and (b) that there will be
                            nothing to displace those inferences as to further
                            facts or [as] to the state of mind of the accused
                            which would reasonably be drawn from the primary
                            facts in the absence of any further explanation.
                            Whoever has the function of deciding facts on the
                            trial of a criminal offence should keep an open mind
                            about the veracity and accuracy of recollection of
                            any individual witness, whether called for the
                            Prosecution or the Defence, until after all the
                            evidence to be tendered in the case on behalf of
                            either side has been heard and it is possible to
                            assess to what extent (if any) that witness’s
                            evidence has been confirmed, explained or
                            contradicted by the evidence of other
                            witnesses.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Lord Diplock then
                    proceeded to explain the effect of s 181(1) by
                    comparing it with the procedure in a jury trial before that
                    mode of trial was abolished in Singapore. His Lordship said
                    (at [16]–[17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    The proper attitude of mind
                            that the decider of fact ought to adopt towards the
                            Prosecution’s evidence at the conclusion of
                            the Prosecution’s case is most easily
                            identified by considering a criminal trial before a
                            judge and jury, such as occurs in England and
                            occurred in Singapore until its final abolition in
                            capital cases in 1969. Here the decision-making
                            function is divided; questions of law are for the
                            judge, questions of fact are for the jury. It is
                            well established that in a jury trial at the
                            conclusion of the Prosecution’s case it is the
                            judge’s function to decide for himself whether
                            evidence has been adduced which, <em>if it were to be accepted by the jury as
                                accurate</em>, would establish each
                            essential element in the alleged offence: for what
                            are the essential elements in any criminal offence
                            is a question of law. <b><em>If there
                                is no evidence (or only evidence that is so
                                inherently incredible that no reasonable person
                                could accept it as being true) to prove any one
                                or more of those essential elements, it is the
                                judge’s duty to direct an acquittal, for
                                it is only upon evidence that juries are
                                entitled to convict; but, if there is some
                                evidence, the judge must let the case go
                                on.</em></b> It is not the function of the
                            jurors, as sole deciders of fact, to make up their
                            minds at that stage of the trial whether they are so
                            convinced of the accuracy of the only evidence that
                            is then before them that they have no reasonable
                            doubt as to the guilt of the accused. If this were
                            indeed their function, since any decision that they
                            reach must be a collective one, it would be
                            necessary for them to retire, consult together and
                            bring in what in effect would be a conditional
                            verdict of guilty before the accused had an
                            opportunity of putting before them any evidence in
                            his defence. On the question of the accuracy of the
                            evidence of any witness jurors would be instructed
                            that it was their duty to suspend judgment until all
                            the evidence of fact that either party wished to put
                            before the court had been presented. Then and then
                            only should they direct their minds to the question
                            whether the guilt of the accused had been proved
                            beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    In their Lordships’ view
                            the same principle applies to criminal trials where
                            the combined roles of decider of law and decider of
                            fact are vested in a single judge (or in two judges
                            trying capital cases). At the conclusion of the
                            Prosecution’s case what has to be decided
                            remains a question of law only. As decider of law,
                            the judge must consider whether there is some
                            evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he
                            were to accept it as accurate, would establish each
                            essential element in the alleged offence. If such
                            evidence as respects any of those essential elements
                            is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in
                            finding “that no case against the accused has
                            been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his
                            conviction”, within the meaning of
                            s 188(1) [<em>sic</em>].
                            Where he has not so found, he must call upon the
                            accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of
                            fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of
                            any of the Prosecution’s witnesses until the
                            Defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the
                            accused or other witnesses as it may want to call
                            and counsel on both sides have addressed to the
                            judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as
                            they may wish to advance.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although s 188(1) [<em>sic</em>] first became law in 1960 and so
                        forms no part of the amendments made by Act 10 of

                        introduced certain new provisions relating to trials in
                        the High Court], their Lordships have dealt with its
                        interpretation at some length because in the judgment of
                        the [CCA] in the case of <em>Ong Kiang
                            Kek</em> … there are certain passages
                        that seem, upon a literal reading, to suggest that
                        unless at the end of the Prosecution’s case the
                        evidence adduced has already satisfied the judge beyond
                        a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty, the judge
                        must order his acquittal. But this can hardly have been
                        what that court intended, for it ignores the presence in
                        the section of the crucial words “if
                        unrebutted”, to which in other passages the court
                        refers, and it converts the hypothetical question of law
                        which the judge has to ask himself at that stage of the
                        proceeding: <em>“If I were to
                            accept the Prosecution’s evidence as accurate

                            and quite different question of fact: “Has

                        that at the trial of Haw Tua Tau the judges may have
                        taken literally those delphic passages in the judgment
                        of the [CCA] in <em>Ong Kiang
                            Kek</em> … to which their Lordships
                        have had occasion to refer. If this be so the only
                        effect can be that the judges applied to the
                        Prosecution’s evidence a more rigorous test of
                        credibility than they need have done before deciding to
                        call on Haw Tua Tau to give evidence. The error, if
                        there was one – and there is nothing in the
                        judges’ reasons for judgment to indicate what was
                        the standard that they did apply – can only have
                        been in favour of the accused. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It should be noted that
                    the Privy Council in <em>Haw Tua
                        </em><em>Tau (PC)</em>,
                    like the CCA in <em>Haw Tua
                        </em><em>Tau (CCA)</em>
                    and <em>Ong Kiang Kek</em>, eschewed
                    the terminology of “a prima facie case” in
                    explaining when the court would call on the Defence at the
                    close of the Prosecution’s case. But, it is clear from
                    the passages in <em>Chin Yoke</em> and
                        <em>R Balasubramaniam</em>
                    which I quoted earlier that the court in those two cases had
                    merely used the terminology of “a prima facie
                    case” as a convenient shorthand for describing the
                    threshold that had to be met before the court would call on
                    the Defence at the close of the Prosecution’s case.
                    Even after <em>Haw Tua </em><em>Tau (PC)</em>, the courts in
                    Singapore did not adopt a consistent approach in using or
                    eschewing (as the case might be) the terminology of
                    “a prima facie case”: see <em>Sim Ah Cheoh and others v Public Prosecutor</em>

                    the principles that a court should apply in deciding whether
                    or not to call on the Defence at the end of the
                    Prosecution’s case as follows (at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>–[4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    The principles on which a court
                            should decide at the closing of the
                            Prosecution’s case whether there is a case for
                            the accused to answer have been set out by the Privy
                            Council in <em>Haw Tua
                                </em><em>Tau [(PC)]</em> … Although
                            these principles are not without their problems in
                            implementation, they have been followed by the
                            courts in Singapore ever since. What these
                            principles mean is that if the judge comes to the
                            conclusion after hearing the Prosecution’s
                            evidence that there is evidence (not inherently
                            incredible) which constitutes a <em>prima facie</em> case which the accused
                            should be called upon to answer, he must call upon
                            the accused to enter upon his defence. Of course,
                            the accused might choose not to give evidence or
                            call witnesses, and it is then left to the judge to
                            assess the credibility of the witnesses and to
                            decide in a case of conflict which of them he finds
                            to be the more credible, before deciding whether the
                            case is proved beyond reasonable
                        doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    However, there is one
                            qualification to this. If, apart from the disputed
                            facts and the credibility of the witnesses, there is
                            hard evidence, whether in the shape of documents or
                            photographs or what are known as “silent
                            facts”, which is itself sufficient to
                            constitute a <em>prima
                                facie</em> case on the charge, the accused
                            cannot choose to remain silent when called upon. If
                            he does remain silent, the unavoidable result is
                            that the case would then have been effectively
                            proved against him beyond reasonable doubt by
                            default.</p>

                        evidence at that stage of the trial was not inherently
                        incredible, which if unrebutted would warrant the

                        called and opt for a <em>maximum

                        require the court to rule that a case beyond reasonable

                        the maximum evaluation test. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response, the court (<em>per</em> M Karthigesu JA) said at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    It seems to us that the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    We respectively agree with
                            Lord Diplock that the crucial words in
                            s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which
                            deals with the procedure to be followed at the close
                            of the Prosecution’s case, are “if
                            unrebutted”. Clearly s 189(1) calls for
                            a two-stage process in a criminal trial and this can
                            only be achieved if a minimum evaluation of the
                            evidence is made at the close of the
                            Prosecution’s case and this of necessity makes
                            the question that the court has to ask itself at the

                            following considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A submission that there is no case to

                                    or is so manifestly unreliable that no
                                    reasonable tribunal could safely convict on

                            evaluation of the evidence a <em>prima facie</em> case was clearly made
                            out against the appellant on each of the three
                            charges with which he was charged and in our view
                            the learned trial judge correctly called on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In my view, the references
                    in <em>Ng Theng </em><em>Shuang</em> (at, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, [20]) to “[a] minimum evaluation of
                    the evidence” and “a maximum evaluation of the
                    evidence” for the purposes of determining whether a
                    trial judge should call on the Defence at the close of the
                    Prosecution’s case mischaracterises the nature of the
                    judicial process in evaluating the evidence at that stage of
                    a criminal trial. The issue at the end of the
                    Prosecution’s case is whether the Defence has a case
                    to answer, and this depends on whether the evidence as it
                    stands then, <em>if accepted</em> by
                    the court, would be sufficient to prove every element of the
                    offence in question either directly or inferentially. In
                    this regard, as Lord Parker CJ said in <em>Practice Direction (Submission of No
                        Case)</em> [1962] 1 WLR 227 (“the 1962
                    English Practice Direction”) (quoted at [97] of
                        <em>Wong Wai Hung</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above)), the
                    court does not have to believe everything in the
                    Prosecution’s evidence at this stage of the
                    proceedings. In my view, this is what is properly meant by
                    “a prima facie case” in a criminal trial at
                    common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>May
                        v O’Sullivan</em> (1955) 92 CLR 654,
                    the High Court of Australia (comprising Dixon CJ, Webb,
                    Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ) examined the terminology
                    of “a prima facie case” at common law and said
                    in its unanimous decision (at 658–659):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When, at the close of the case for the prosecution, a
                        submission is made that there is “no case to
                        answer”, the question to be decided is not
                        whether on the evidence as it stands the defendant ought
                        to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it
                        stands he <em>could</em> lawfully
                        be convicted. This is really a question of law. Unless
                        there is some special statutory provision on the
                        subject, a ruling that there <em>is</em> a “case to answer” has
                        no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on
                        the prosecution from beginning to end. After the
                        prosecution has adduced evidence sufficient to support
                        proof of the issue, the defendant may or may not call
                        evidence. Whether he does or not, the question to be
                        decided in the end by the tribunal is whether, on the
                        whole of the evidence before it, it is satisfied beyond
                        reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. This is a
                        question of fact. In deciding this question it may in
                        some cases be legitimate, as is pointed out in <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Buttery</em> [(1926) SASR 150] for it to take
                        into account the fact that the defendant has not given
                        evidence as a consideration making the inference of
                        guilt from the evidence for the prosecution less unsafe
                        than it might otherwise possibly appear: cf. <em>Morgan</em> v. <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox</em>, per Isaacs J.
                        [(1929) 43 CLR 163 at 178]. But to say this is a
                        very different thing from saying that the onus of proof
                        shifts. <b><em>A magistrate who has decided
                            that there is a “case to answer” may
                            quite consistently, if no evidence is called for the
                            defendant, refuse to convict on the evidence for the
                            prosecution. The prosecution may have made “a
                            prima facie case”, but it does not follow
                            that in the absence of a “satisfactory
                            answer” the defendant should be
                            convicted</em></b><b>.</b>

                    (comprising Dixon CJ, Kitto, Menzies and Owen JJ),
                    Kitto J, in his separate decision, restated the meaning
                    of “a prima facie case” in these words (at

                        before which he is charged is satisfied beyond a

                            the defence to answer. </em><em>The question whether there is a case to answer,
                            arising as it does at the end of the
                            prosecution’s evidence in chief, is simply the
                            question of law whether the defendant could lawfully
                            be convicted on the evidence as it stands, –
                            whether, that is to say, there is with respect to

                        no more reason than there is in any other case why a
                        weakness in the prosecution’s case may not be eked
                        out by something in the case for the defence, or why a
                        prima facie inference which by itself would not be
                        strong enough to exclude reasonable doubt may not be
                        hardened into satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt by a
                        failure of the defendant to provide satisfactory
                        evidence in answer to it when he is in a position to do
                        so: cf. <em>R.</em> v. <em>Burdett</em> [(1820)

<p class="Judg-1">Applying the above principles to the evidence
                    adduced by the Prosecution in <em>Zanetti v

                        challenge as could well be imagined. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The meaning of “a prima facie case”
                    as explained by Lord Parker in the 1962 English
                    Practice Direction (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> and <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above) and by the High Court of
                    Australia in the decisions quoted above is, in my view, the
                    meaning that Lord Diplock intended to convey in his
                    analysis of s 181(1) of the 1970 CPC in <em>Haw Tua </em><em>Tau (PC)</em>. “A prima facie
                    case” in this context simply means (using
                    Kitto J’s formulation in <em>Zanetti v Hill</em>) a case of such a nature that
                    the accused can be lawfully convicted on the evidence as it
                    stands at the close of the Prosecution’s case
                    (assuming such evidence is accepted by the court) on the
                    basis that such evidence would either prove every element of
                    the offence in question directly or enable its existence to
                    be inferred. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind
                    that the evidence as it stands at the close of the
                    Prosecution’s case, even if accepted by the court, may
                    not be sufficient to prove every element of the offence
                    when, as stated by Lord Parker in the 1962 English
                    Practice Direction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the evidence adduced by the prosecution has
                        been so discredited as a result of cross-examination or
                        is so manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal
                        could safely convict on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Such discredited or
                    manifestly unreliable evidence would not be accepted by the
                    court even as <em>prima facie</em>
                    evidence of a primary fact, and therefore, the inherent
                    incredibility exception in the first presumption in
                        <em>Haw Tua </em><em>Tau (PC)</em> at [15] (quoted at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) would not be
                    relevant to such evidence. In other words, where the
                    evidence adduced to prove a primary fact is discredited or
                    wholly unreliable, there is no need for the court to even
                        <em>presume</em> that that evidence
                    is true unless it is inherently incredible: this is because
                    that evidence has already clearly been shown to be wholly
                    unreliable. Further, even if the court were to apply the
                    inherent incredibility exception in such a situation, the
                    court <em>cannot</em> presume that an
                    inference drawn from a primary fact is true <em>unless</em> that inference can reasonably
                    be drawn. The court may not draw any inference which it
                    likes from primary facts just because the inference is
                    credible, or just because the inference is not inherently
                    incredible. There is a distinction between, on the one hand,
                    accepting evidence of primary facts as true for the purposes
                    of deciding whether to call on the Defence at the close of
                    the Prosecution’s case and, on the other hand,
                    inferring further facts from those primary facts for that
                    purpose. For example, <em>mere
                        </em><em>evidence</em> of the
                    accused’s failure to record certain items in an
                    account book does not allow the court to infer an intention
                    on his part to defraud where fraud is an element of the
                    offence charged (see the passage from <em>R Balasubramaniam</em> (at 122) quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). The
                    different standards that apply to primary facts and inferred
                    facts must be kept in mind in the present
                context.</p>

                    it stands, the accused <em>ought</em>
                    to be convicted, but whether, on that evidence, he <em>could</em> lawfully be convicted. Calling
                    for the accused’s defence at the close of the
                    Prosecution’s case only brings the proceedings to the
                    next stage, when the accused is expected to rebut the
                    Prosecution’s <em>prima
                        facie</em> case. Even if the Defence is called,
                    should the accused elect not to enter his defence, the court
                    may still acquit him if, on a final evaluation of all the
                    evidence adduced before it, it concludes that the charge has
                    not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt – a burden
                    which never shifts to the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Restatement of the meaning of “a prima
                facie case” in s 82A(6) of the LPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In civil/criminal
                    proceedings, if the defendant/accused makes a submission of
                    no case to answer at the close of the
                    plaintiff’s/Prosecution’s case and the court
                    accepts the submission (<em>ie</em>,
                    the court agrees that the plaintiff/Prosecution has indeed
                    failed to establish a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case), the claim/charge against the
                    defendant/accused will be dismissed. However, there is a
                    difference between civil and criminal proceedings where a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case has been
                    made out. In civil proceedings, if the defendant makes a
                    submission of no case to answer at the close of the
                    plaintiff’s case but the court rejects that submission
                        (<em>ie</em>, the court finds that
                    the plaintiff has made out a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case), judgment <em>will</em> be given for the plaintiff; the
                    defendant will not be allowed to enter his defence. In
                    criminal proceedings, if the court finds that the
                    Prosecution has made out a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case, the accused will be called upon
                    to enter his defence. If he elects not to do so, the court
                    may still acquit him of the charge if it considers that some
                    or all of the elements of the offence in question have not
                    been proved beyond a reasonable doubt (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above). In contrast,
                    disciplinary proceedings under the LPA are a <em>sui </em><em>generis</em> form of proceedings having, under
                    existing judicial authority, some of the characteristics of
                    criminal proceedings in that: (a) the standard of proof
                    of misconduct under the LPA is the criminal standard of
                    proof beyond a reasonable doubt; and (b) if the
                    respondent’s submission of no case to answer after the
                    “Prosecution” has closed its case is rejected,
                    the respondent will still be allowed to enter his defence.
                    This would be the ordinary rule in disciplinary proceedings
                    under the LPA against advocates and solicitors. More
                    importantly for present purposes, disciplinary proceedings
                    against LSOs (as well as non-practising solicitors) under
                    s 82A of the LPA in particular (“s 82A
                    disciplinary proceedings”) contain an additional
                    feature absent in criminal proceedings. Under s 82A(6)
                    of the LPA, even if a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case for an investigation into a
                    complaint of misconduct against an LSO is made out, this
                    merely entails that the Chief Justice “<em>may</em>” [emphasis added] give
                    leave for such an investigation to be carried out; the Chief
                    Justice is not mandated to give leave whenever a <em>prima facie</em> case for an
                    investigation has been established. If leave is given, the
                    Chief Justice will appoint a Disciplinary Tribunal, which
                    will then investigate the complaint and report its findings
                    to the Chief Justice. If the Disciplinary Tribunal finds
                    that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action
                    exists against the LSO concerned, the Chief Justice
                        “<em>shall</em>”
                    [emphasis added] (see s 82A(9) of the LPA) dismiss the
                    complaint. If the Disciplinary Tribunal finds otherwise, the
                    Chief Justice “<em>may</em>” [emphasis added], pursuant to
                    s 82A(10) of the LPA, appoint an advocate and solicitor
                    or an LSO to apply by summons in the same proceedings for an
                    order that the LSO concerned be struck off the roll,
                    prohibited from applying for a practising certificate,
                    censured or otherwise punished. Again, the Chief Justice is
                    not mandated to appoint an advocate and solicitor or an LSO
                    to apply for such an order even if the Disciplinary Tribunal
                    makes an adverse report against the LSO
                concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It can be seen from the
                    foregoing that the Chief Justice is vested with a statutory
                    discretion in s 82A disciplinary proceedings which a
                    court of law does not have in civil/criminal proceedings.
                    Under s 82A of the LPA, the Chief Justice has the
                    discretion <em>not</em> to grant leave
                    for an investigation to be made into a complaint of
                    misconduct against an LSO even if a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of misconduct has been made out
                    against the LSO concerned, and, furthermore, also has the
                    discretion <em>not</em> to take the
                    matter further even if the Disciplinary Tribunal finds that
                    cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action against
                    that LSO exists. Of course, this does not mean that the
                    Chief Justice may decide arbitrarily in these matters as the
                    discretionary powers under s 82A have been given to him
                    to achieve the legislative objective of this section and not
                    to frustrate it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In view of the
                    discretionary powers vested in the Chief Justice in
                    s 82A disciplinary proceedings as distinguished from
                    the court’s powers in civil/criminal proceedings, is
                    there a case for applying a different type of test for
                    “a prima facie case” for the purposes of
                    s 82A(6) of the LPA? In this regard, the crucial
                    difference between civil/criminal proceedings and s 82A
                    disciplinary proceedings is that in the former, if the judge
                    rules at the close of the
                    plaintiff’s/Prosecution’s case that a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out
                    and, as a corollary, calls on the defendant/accused to enter
                    his defence, it is the defendant/accused who decides whether
                    to continue with the trial by entering his defence. If the
                    defendant/accused elects to continue with the trial, he will
                    be tried by the same judge (<em>viz</em>, the judge who ruled that a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out).
                    In contrast, in s 82A disciplinary proceedings, if the
                    Chief Justice is of the opinion that a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out, it is he
                    who decides whether to take the matter further by appointing
                    a Disciplinary Tribunal to investigate the complaint in
                    question. If the Chief Justice does decide to appoint a
                    Disciplinary Tribunal, the LSO concerned will be
                    “tried” by a different tribunal from the
                    “tribunal” (<em>viz</em>,
                    the Chief Justice) which decided that a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out. In my
                    view, this difference between civil/criminal proceedings and
                    s 82A disciplinary proceedings, although significant,
                    is ultimately merely a procedural difference. It is
                    therefore not in itself a sufficient reason to apply a
                    different test for “a prima facie case” in
                    s 82A disciplinary proceedings from the test applicable
                    in civil/criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     With these principles in
                    mind, I shall now examine the substance of the
                    Applicant’s complaint in the present OS and his
                    allegations against the DPP to determine whether the
                    evidence contained in the Applicant’s 31/1/2012
                    affidavit and the court records is sufficient to make out a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case for an
                    investigation into these allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the present OS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The complainant in the
                    District Court trial (“PW3”) was the owner of
                    a Hyundai Matrix car (“the Car”), which had,
                    at the material time, a market value (comprising its body
                    value as well as PARF and COE rebates) of about $26,400. PW3
                    had an outstanding bank loan of $42,000 on the Car. Thus,
                    the Car had a negative value of about $15,600. PW3 wanted to
                    buy a new Honda Fit car for $58,800 from the Accused, who
                    was a car salesman. They agreed to do a trade-in – PW3
                    would sell the Car to the Accused for $29,200 and also pay
                    the Accused $13,000 so that the Accused could discharge the
                    bank loan and de-register the Car. In exchange, the Accused
                    would sell PW3 a new Honda Fit for $58,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Pursuant to this
                    agreement, on 24 May 2008, PW3 delivered the Car to the
                    Accused, who promptly sold it on 28 May 2008 to a
                    re-exporter for $4,000. PW3 alleged that on 22 June
                    2008, he paid a further sum of $6,412 to the Accused. As the
                    bank loan on the Car was still outstanding, interest
                    continued to accrue and the value of the Car continued to
                    decline. The bank began to threaten bankruptcy proceedings
                    against PW3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 28 January 2009,
                    PW3 made a police report against the Accused in connection
                    with the Car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On
                    31 January 2009, PW3 made a “999” call to
                    the police at 16:29:13h<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> (“the
                    1st 999 Call”). About ten minutes later, at
                    16:38:07h, he made a second “999”
                        call<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> (“the
                    2nd 999 Call”). On 20 February 2009, PW3 made
                    another call (this time, a non-“999” call) to
                    Tanglin Police Station at 16:01:14h<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    (“the Non-999 Call”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Hence, in total, PW3
                    contacted the police four times about the Car:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     PW3 was recorded
                        as having told the police in his police report made on

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">On 24.05.2008 at about 3.00pm, I traded [the Car]
                            with Apex Global Trading via an agent, [the
                            Accused,] for a new [Honda Fit]. I paid him
                            SGD8000.00 for the transaction. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Two months later, I persistently received letters

                            road tax. When I confronted [the Accused], he asked
                            me for the letters and told me that he would be
                            settling it. Sometime in August 2008, I called LTA
                            to enquire about the notice of road tax renewal for
                            the [Car] and the status of the vehicle. They
                            informed me that the [Car] is still under my name
                            and if the [C]ar has already been exported, they
                            would no longer have any records of the

                            asking him about the letters that I received from
                            LTA and the status of the [Car]. He kept insisting
                            that the [Car] is already in export zone

                    that on 21 April 2010, the DPP handed T1 and F1 to PW10
                    to identify, and they were admitted as a joint exhibit
                    marked as “P17”. At the same time, the DPP
                    also handed to the Applicant another set of two documents,
                    which, as it later transpired, turned out to be <em>T2</em> and F1 instead. It is not clear
                    whether the Applicant read the documents there and then, but
                    he did not cross-examine PW10 to clarify whether the police
                    call records showed PW3 as having made one or two
                    “999” calls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Applicant was aware
                    from the contents of T2 and F1 that PW3 had made two
                    “999” calls about ten minutes apart on the
                    same day. This is evident from his reference to the two
                    “999” calls (as well as the other two times
                    PW3 had contacted the police) in his written closing
                    submissions dated 20 August 2010 for the District Court
                    trial. He contended that the four “999” call
                    records showed “a development in PW3’s
                    endeavo[u]r to frame the [A]ccused”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The DJ convicted the
                    Accused of the 1st Charge (on the finding that he had
                    dishonestly retained the sale proceeds of $4,000 after
                    selling the Car contrary to PW3’s instructions (see
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above)), but
                    acquitted the Accused of the 2nd Charge (on the finding that
                    the Prosecution had not proved PW3’s allegation (see,
                    likewise, <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above)
                    that he had given $6,412 to the Accused). In his grounds of
                    decision (see <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Ezmiwardi Bin Kanan</em> [2011] SGDC 152
                        (“<em>Ezmiwardi (DC)</em>”)), the DJ made
                    no mention whatever of either the 1st 999 Call or the 2nd
                    999 Call. In other words, neither of those calls was
                    relevant to the factual findings made by the DJ in
                    convicting the Accused of the 1st Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Accused appealed (via
                    MA 401/2010) against his conviction of the 1st Charge,
                    whilst the Prosecution appealed against his acquittal of the
                    2nd Charge. While preparing his skeletal arguments for the
                    appeal, the Applicant discovered from the record of
                    proceedings that P17 consisted of T1 and F1, but did not
                    include T2. This led the Applicant to file CM 58/2011
                    for leave to admit T2 for the purposes of MA 401/2010.
                    In the Applicant’s 15/8/2011 affidavit filed in

                            gave strange and inconsistent testimony during the
                            trial. The ‘cards’ were stacked against
                            the [Accused] and he faced the seemingly impossible

                            person who claimed that he had obtained the said

                            he had stated that there were no ‘999’

                            both the DPP and PW10 <u>chose</u> to only admit the earlier call
                            record as P17. This was probably to maintain
                            ‘consistency’ with PW3’s
                            testimony. However, in so doing, both the DPP and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    Based on [the Applicant’s 15/8/2011]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    In
                            paragraph 17 of his affidavit, [the Applicant]
                            has made two allegations against me:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    That I had “got PW3

                                earlier testified that he had made “two
                                on the same day”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    That I had done so
                                “probably to maintain
                                ‘consistency’ with PW3’s
                                testimony” in order to “mislead
                                the Court by distorting the facts of the
                                case”, and that had I “not
                                ‘inadvertently’ furnished him with a
                                certified true copy of the other
                                ‘999’ report”, the [Accused]
                                “would never have known that the case
                                against him was tainted”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">My responses are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    First, I did not pose leading
                            questions to PW3 in relation to the number of phone
                            calls he made. If at all, any confusion stemmed from
                            PW3’s testimony. While my question clearly
                            sought to clarify his earlier testimony about making
                            two ‘999’ calls … his answer
                            reveals that he confused the call made to the
                            mainline of Tanglin Police Division [<em>ie</em>, the Non-999 Call made on
                            20 February 2009] … as being a
                            ‘999’ call … Though PW3 earlier
                            gave testimony that he made two calls to the Police
                            on the same day, in his answer to my open-ended
                            question as to when the second call was made he made
                            specific reference to a ‘999’ call made
                            on the day the [Accused] was arrested. The existence
                            of [T2] clearly reveals that PW3 had confused the
                            calls. It is therefore entirely baseless for [the
                            Applicant] to contend that I had “got PW3 to
                            state that he had made only one ‘999’
                            call[”] when he had earlier testified that he
                            had made “two on the same
                        day”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    Second, [the
                            Applicant’s] allegation that I acted in bad
                            faith is entirely baseless. The error on my part in
                            perceiving that only one ‘999’ call
                            transcript had been retrieved by [PW10] is now
                            before this Honourable Court. In fact, [the
                            Applicant]’s basis for leveling such
                            allegations is purely from being in possession of
                                <em>[T2]</em> …
                            which I myself had furnished him. … [The
                            Applicant]’s allegation that I intended to
                            suppress this evidence and
                            ‘inadvertently’ gave him a copy of the
                            very document I intended to ‘suppress’
                            is wildly speculative, and untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Further, … [F1] and
                            [T2] clearly relate to two different
                            ‘999’ calls. In fact, it is evident from
                            the ‘999’ call transcript in his
                            possession [<em>viz</em>, T2]
                            that the call in question was a follow-up to an
                            earlier ‘999’ call. Whilst accepting my
                            own mistake, it must be noted that [the Applicant]
                            could have nipped the confusion in its bud if he had
                            questioned PW3 on 21 April 2010 based on the
                            ‘999’ call transcript in his possession!
                            Instead, he now dissects PW3’s evidence given
                            in re-examination and attributes bad faith where
                            there was none. A further opportunity where [the
                            Applicant] should clearly have been alerted that
                            something was amiss came when PW10 was recalled on
                            the same day to formally admit the ‘999’
                            call transcript. If [the Applicant] had merely
                            looked at his copies of the ‘999’ call
                            transcripts, he would have immediately realized that
                            the message set out in [F1] and the message set out
                            in [T2] (which ought to have corresponded) were
                            completely different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    [The Applicant] has further
                            insinuated at paragraph 22 of his affidavit
                            that PW3 was shown P17 … before he took the
                            stand on 21 April 2010 which led to him
                            changing his testimony regarding the number of calls
                            made. I categorically deny having
                            ‘coached’ or in any way, having
                            interfered with PW3 in order to procure evidence to
                            support the prosecution’s case. I also
                            categorically deny having shown P17 … to PW3
                            before re-examining him on 21 April 2010. In
                            this regard, I reiterate that [PW10] only handed me
                            the ‘999’ call transcripts on the
                            morning of 21 April 2010 just prior to the
                            commencement of the proceedings, or during the short
                            recess granted by the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    … [The Applicant]
                            contended at paragraph 26 of his affidavit that
                            either the “DPP or [PW10] had chosen to
                            mislead the Court by leading and/or tendering
                            evidence of only one ‘999’ call when
                            they actually had copies of 2 reports in their
                            possession”. I categorically deny the
                            allegations and I invite [the Applicant], having
                            read the materials, to withdraw the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At the joint hearing of
                    CM 58/2011 and MA 401/2010, the High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”) admitted in evidence T2 (marked
                    as “P17A”) without any objection by the
                    Prosecution. He declined to deal with the Applicant’s
                    allegations of misconduct against the DPP or the DPP’s
                    response to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     At the conclusion of the
                    hearing, the Judge acquitted the Accused of the 1st Charge
                    (the Accused appealed against only his conviction of the 1st
                    Charge as he had been acquitted by the DJ of the 2nd
                    Charge). The Judge held that the 1st Charge and the 2nd
                    Charge were based on the same transaction, and that the
                    reason the Accused did not de-register the Car was because
                    PW3 had not paid him the $13,000 which PW3 had agreed to pay
                    under the terms of the trade-in agreement (see <em>Ezmiwardi bin Kanan v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2012] SGHC 44 (“<em>Ezmiwardi (HC)</em>”) at
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>). The Judge
                    also found that PW3’s statement in his police report
                    made on 28 January 2009 that he had paid $8,000 to the
                    Accused (see sub-para (a) of <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above) contradicted his subsequent
                    testimony at the District Court trial that he had paid
                    $14,412 (<em>viz</em>, $8,000 plus
                    $6,412) to the Accused (see <em>Ezmiwardi (HC)</em> at [14]–[16]). In the result, the
                    Judge held that for these and other reasons, the Prosecution
                    had failed to prove the 1st Charge beyond a reasonable
                    doubt. It therefore followed (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the Prosecution’s appeal
                    against the Accused’s acquittal of the 2nd Charge)
                    that the 2nd Charge had also not been proved beyond a
                    reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The setting aside of the
                    Accused’s conviction of the 1st Charge and the
                    dismissal of the Prosecution’s appeal in respect of
                    the 2nd Charge should have brought an end to this matter.
                    However, the Applicant said that he had a deep sense of
                    grievance that the DPP had unjustly put the Accused through
                    the painful ordeal of a 22-day trial by misleading the DJ on
                    the evidence. No small part of the Applicant’s
                    grievance could be attributed to his acrimonious exchange of
                    letters with the Attorney-General’s Chambers
                    (“the AGC”) following his complaint to the
                    Attorney-General about the DPP’s misconduct at the
                    District Court trial. The AGC accused the Applicant of
                    making “cavalier”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and

                    demanded the withdrawal of those allegations as well as the
                    tender of an apology to the DPP “as a matter of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     the DPP
                        intentionally withheld T2 from the DJ on 21 April
                        2010 (“the Applicant’s 1st
                        allegation”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     the DPP misled the DJ, the
                        Accused and the Applicant into believing that only one
                        “999” call, <em>viz</em>, the 1st 999 Call, had been made by
                        PW3 (“the Applicant’s 2nd
                        allegation”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     the DPP led PW3 to lie about
                        the two “999” calls which he had made by
                        making him change his evidence to state that he had made
                        only one “999” call instead of two
                        (“the Applicant’s 3rd allegation”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_d"></a>(d)     the DPP colluded with PW10 to mislead
                        the DJ, the Accused and the Applicant as described at
                        sub-para (b) above (“the Applicant’s
                        4th allegation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I shall now
                    consider if the Applicant has made out a <em>prima facie</em> case for an investigation by a
                    Disciplinary Tribunal into each of these
                allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Applicant’s 1st allegation: Did the DPP
                intentionally withhold T2 from the DJ?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In respect of the
                    Applicant’s 1st allegation, on the basis of the
                    evidence before me, there is proof that: (a) the DPP
                    tendered T1 and F1 to the DJ at the District Court trial
                    (which documents were admitted and jointly marked as exhibit
                    “P17”), but did not tender T2 as an exhibit;
                    and (b) at the same time, the DPP gave a copy of T2 and
                    F1 to the Applicant. There is no evidence that the DPP
                        <em>intentionally</em> omitted to
                    tender T2 as an exhibit. The Applicant has argued that the
                    DPP’s omission was intentional because she had been
                    given T2 or had at least been informed of its existence by
                    PW10 when PW10 handed copies of the four “999”
                    call records to her on 21 April 2010. There is,
                    however, no such evidence on record. The argument underlying
                    the Applicant’s 1st allegation is based solely on two
                    primary facts, namely, the DPP did not tender T2 as an
                    exhibit at the District Court trial, and yet, gave a copy of
                    it to the Applicant. The Applicant is asking me to infer
                    from these two primary facts that the DPP intentionally
                    omitted to tender T2 to the DJ as an exhibit. I am unable,
                    on any reasonable basis, to draw this inference simply
                    because it would not explain why the DPP gave a copy of T2
                    to the Applicant if she had intended not to tender that
                    document as an exhibit in court. Between inferring that the
                    DPP’s omission to tender T2 as an exhibit was an
                    intentional act and inferring that that omission was an
                    inadvertent act, it is unreasonable, if not irrational, to
                    infer the former when it is obviously much more reasonable
                    to infer the latter, given the lack of <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the DPP had
                    intended to mislead the DJ into believing that PW3 had made
                    only one “999” call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Applicant’s 1st
                    allegation has even less traction when one considers a
                    crucial question which the Applicant should have asked
                    himself, but did not, namely – why would the DPP have
                    wanted to mislead the DJ on the number of
                    “999” calls made by PW3? What was the point of
                    doing so? I accept that the 1st 999 Call and the 2nd 999
                    Call were part of the background to PW3’s complaints
                    about the Accused to the police. But, these two
                    “999” calls were not essential to the
                    Prosecution’s case against the Accused, nor were they
                    part of the factual basis on which the three charges against
                    the Accused were based. As such, neither the 1st 999 Call
                    nor the 2nd 999 Call was relied on by the DJ in convicting
                    the Accused of the 1st Charge. The DPP made no reference to
                    any “999” call by PW3 as part of the
                    Prosecution’s evidence of the criminal act of the
                    Accused in retaining the $4,000 which was the subject matter
                    of the 1st Charge. The DJ made no reference to any
                    “999” call in <em>Ezmiwardi (DC</em>); neither did the Judge
                    in <em>Ezmiwardi (HC)</em>. The
                    fact is that the 1st 999 Call and the 2nd 999 Call were
                    incidental and innocuous events in the context of the
                    Accused’s prosecution for the 1st Charge and the 2nd
                    Charge. They do not even qualify as primary facts which go
                    towards proving any of the essential elements of these two
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Accordingly, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Applicant’s 1st
                    allegation, I am unable to accept, on the evidence before
                    me, that the Applicant has made out a <em>prima facie</em> case that the DPP intentionally
                    withheld T2 from the DJ. It follows that it is not
                    justifiable to appoint a Disciplinary Tribunal to
                    investigate this particular allegation. At the highest, the
                    only rational inference to be drawn from the DPP’s
                    failure to tender T2 to the DJ as an exhibit is that she was
                    careless or might even have been negligent in failing to do
                    so. In other words, as the Applicant himself alleged (in one
                    of his letters to the Attorney-General), the DPP
                        “botched”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>
                    her job by not perusing the four “999” call
                    records carefully before tendering only T1 and F1 as a joint
                    exhibit at the District Court trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Applicant’s 2nd allegation: Did the DPP
                mislead the DJ, the Accused and the Applicant into believing
                that only one “999” call, viz, the 1st 999 Call,
                had been made by PW3?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I turn now to the
                    Applicant’s 2nd allegation. Having regard to the
                    factual basis and the reasoning of the DJ in convicting the
                    Accused of the 1st Charge while acquitting him of the 2nd
                    Charge, it would be unreasonable, if not irrational, for me
                    to infer that the DJ was misled into making these two
                    decisions by the DPP’s omission to tender T2 as an
                    exhibit at the District Court trial. The DJ could not have
                    been misled as to the materiality or otherwise of
                    PW3’s “999” calls to the guilt or
                    otherwise of the Accused <em>vis-à-vis</em> the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge.
                    As explained earlier, the 1st 999 Call and the 2nd 999 Call
                    were both irrelevant to the essential elements of these two
                    charges, and the DJ made no reference to either of them in
                    convicting the Accused of the 1st Charge. The irrelevance of
                    these two calls is also confirmed by <em>Ezmiwardi (HC)</em>, where the Judge
                    likewise made no reference to either of these calls in
                    setting aside the Accused’s conviction of the 1st
                    Charge. The Applicant (and, as a corollary, the Accused)
                    also could not possibly have been misled into believing that
                    PW3 had made only one “999” call (<em>viz</em>, the 1st 999 Call) because the
                    Applicant had T2 in his possession and, as noted earlier
                    (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above), had
                    referred to the 2nd 999 Call in his written closing
                    submissions for the District Court trial. Accordingly, I
                    find that the Applicant has not made out a <em>prima facie</em> case for a Disciplinary
                    Tribunal to be appointed to investigate his second
                    allegation against the DPP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Applicant’s 3rd allegation: Did the DPP
                lead PW3 to lie by making him change his evidence to state that
                he had made only one “999” call instead of
                two?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Applicant’s 3rd
                    allegation is based on the Applicant’s interpretation
                    of the sequence of answers given by PW3 in his testimony
                    when he was re-examined by the DPP on 21 April 2010
                    (see the exchange between the DPP and PW3 quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above).
                    Essentially, this allegation is based on the case theory
                    that the DPP and PW10:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [a]fter discovering and coming into
                        possession of the said 2 ‘999’ reports,
                        …
                        <u>decided</u> to admit only the
                            1<sup>st</sup>. Probably oblivious
                        to the above testimony [<em>viz</em>, PW3’s oral testimony on
                        22 March 2010 that he had made two
                        “999” calls (see the quote at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above)], the DPP
                        chose to procure evidence from PW3 that he only made the
                        one ‘999’ call … [underlining in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the evidence on record, there is nothing
                    which shows or even suggests that the DPP and PW10 made the
                    above alleged decision or had any reason to do so. The only
                    relevant evidence in this connection is that PW10, pursuant
                    to the DPP’s direction (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above), made another search of the
                    police call records in the evening on 20 April 2010,
                    found the four “999” call records, made copies
                    of those records and gave them to the DPP on 21 April
                    2010. The DPP then fumbled in tendering only F1 and T1 to
                    the DJ as a joint exhibit on the same day (<em>viz</em>, 21 April 2010). From these
                    primary facts, I am asked to infer that the DPP and PW10
                    decided to admit only F1 and T1, but the DPP let the cat out
                    of the bag by her carelessness in giving a copy of T2 to the
                    Applicant. In my view, such an inference is unreasonable, if
                    not irrational. In fact, the evidence on record shows that
                    the DPP actually reminded PW3 that he had earlier testified
                    that he had made two “999” calls. But, when
                    asked when those two calls were made, PW3 gave confusing
                    answers to the DPP’s questions by referring to the
                    Non-999 Call on 20 February 2009 as his second
                    “999” call. For ease of reference, I reproduce
                    again below the relevant exchange between the DPP and PW3 in
                    this regard:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Applicant has alleged
                    that PW3’s testimony here shows that PW3 changed his
                    position on not only the number of “999” calls
                    which he made, but also the contents of his complaint
                    against the Accused, and that the DPP led him to do so. In
                    my view, nothing in this exchange suggests that PW3 changed
                    his evidence or the contents of his complaint (which was
                    that the Accused cheated him by disposing of the Car in a
                    manner contrary to his instructions). The Accused did not
                    deny that on the occasion referred to in PW3’s
                    testimony (quoted above), PW3 did wait for five hours for
                    him to turn up, but in vain. It is pertinent to note that on
                    appeal in MA 401/2010, the Accused did not make any
                    written submission to the Judge that PW3 had lied in this
                    regard as a ground for disbelieving his
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is also pertinent to
                    note that the Applicant’s 3rd allegation was made only
                    after the Applicant discovered that P17 in the court records
                    consisted of only T1 and F1. If PW3 had indeed changed his
                    evidence during the District Court trial as alleged, the
                    Applicant, as defence counsel, would (or at least, should)
                    have been aware of this. The Applicant could and should have
                    cross-examined PW3 there and then on the apparent
                    contradictions in his evidence. Further, the Applicant could
                    also have addressed these inconsistencies in his written
                    closing submissions. However, he did neither.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the circumstances, I am
                    not satisfied that the Applicant has made out a <em>prima facie</em> case of misconduct that
                    requires an investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal where
                    his third allegation against the DPP is
                concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Applicant’s 4th allegation: Did the DPP
                collude with PW10 to mislead the DJ, the Accused and the
                Applicant into believing that only one “999” call
                (viz, the 1st 999 Call) had been made by PW3?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For the reasons given in
                    relation to the Applicant’s first three allegations
                    against the DPP (see <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>–<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above), I find that the
                    Applicant’s 4th allegation –
                    <em>viz</em>, that the DPP colluded
                    with PW10 to mislead the DJ, the Accused and the Applicant
                    into believing that PW3 had made only one
                    “999” call, namely, the 1st 999 Call –
                    is completely groundless and unwarranted. It follows that no
                        <em>prima facie</em> case has been
                    made out for an investigation into this
                allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations on <em>ex
                    parte</em> applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The present OS is an
                        <em>ex parte</em> application for
                    leave to have the DPP, in her capacity as an officer of the
                    court, investigated by a Disciplinary Tribunal for the four
                    alleged acts of misconduct summarised at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above. The Applicant has
                    filed an affidavit in support of his application (<em>viz</em>, the Applicant’s 31/1/2012
                    affidavit), in which he has disclosed all the relevant facts
                    and documents, <em>except</em> the
                    affidavits filed by the DPP and PW10 in CM 58/2011. In
                    not disclosing these documents, the Applicant has withheld a
                    material fact – namely, that both the DPP and PW10
                    have endeavoured to explain, on affidavit, how and why the
                    DPP’s omission to tender T2 as an exhibit at the
                    District Court trial came about. It is an established
                    principle of law in all <em>ex
                        parte</em> applications for orders that affect the
                    rights or interests of the respondent that the applicant
                    must give full disclosure to the court of all the material
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Of course, for the
                    purposes of the present OS, I need not and should not decide
                    on the truth or otherwise of the explanations given by the
                    DPP and PW10 in their respective affidavits filed in
                    CM 58/2011. These affidavits are not relevant to my
                    determination of whether, on the evidence produced by the
                    Applicant, a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    has been made out for the purposes of s 82A(6) of the
                    LPA. Be that as it may, in my view, the fact that the DPP
                    and PW10 have both denied, on affidavit, the
                    Applicant’s allegations (the truth or otherwise of
                    their denials being, as just mentioned, irrelevant in this
                    regard) is a fact that should have been disclosed by the
                    Applicant in his supporting affidavit for the present OS,
                    especially since the DPP’s and PW10’s affidavits
                    in CM 58/2011 are already part of the court records for
                    that case. I assume that this omission on the
                    Applicant’s part was inadvertent, having regard to the
                    fact that this is the first time that an application is
                    being made under s 82A of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     For the reasons given
                    above, I dismiss the present OS.</p>
