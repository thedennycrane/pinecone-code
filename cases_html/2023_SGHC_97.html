To bolster his evidential case, the plaintiff filed the present two applications. In HC/SUM 3879/2022 (“SUM 3879”), he sought an order to examine eight witnesses who are based overseas. In HC/SUM 4340/2022 (“SUM 4340”), he sought an order to subpoena three witnesses who are based in Singapore and to dispense with their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After hearing the parties on 10 February 2023, I dismissed both applications.

He is in the business of providing marine surveying services and undertaking other marine consultancy work. The defendant, Stichting Chemical Distribution Institute (also referred to as “CDI”), is a non-profit foundation which <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> promotes the safety and security of the marine chemical industry by operating an inspection scheme known as the “CDI-M Scheme”. The plaintiff was accredited as an inspector under the CDI-M Scheme in November 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the present summonses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 From May 2014, the defendant had been informed on multiple occasions of alleged concerns over the plaintiff’s excessive fees. On 27 October 2016, the defendant received a formal complaint regarding the plaintiff’s alleged excessive fees from MTM Ship Management Singapore (“MTMSM”). The defendant suspended the plaintiff on 28 October 2016 pending a review process, before eventually revoking his licence permanently with effect from 7 February 2017 upon the conclusion of this process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On or around 28 January 2019, the Plaintiff filed a data subject access request (“DSAR”) with the defendant under article 15 of the Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) No 2016/679, also known as the United Kingdom (“UK”) General Data Protection Regulations. Subsequently, on 3 April 2019, the plaintiff filed a claim against the defendant before the High Court of England &amp; Wales (Queen’s Bench Division) (“the UK proceedings”), alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract and duty of care in wrongfully revoking his accreditation. On 20 April 2020, the High Court endorsed a settlement of the UK proceedings in the form of a Tomlin order. This consent order provided for the immediate reinstatement of the plaintiff’s accreditation in addition to the payment of a sum of £645,000.00 to the plaintiff in settlement of the breach of contract claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As a result of the DSAR request and the plaintiff’s specific disclosure application in the UK proceedings, the plaintiff received from the defendant several documents concerning himself. The plaintiff’s case in HC/S 30/2022 is that certain statements made by the defendant, <span class="font-italic">viz</span> eight sets of words, were defamatory and/or malicious falsehoods (the “Words”). The Words relate to the defendant’s suspension and eventual revocation of the plaintiff’s accreditation in the CDI-M Scheme. The Words are set out in a table in Annex 1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff claims that the Words are false, undermine the plaintiff’s credibility, have caused grievous harm to the plaintiff’s personal integrity, professional reputation, honour, courage, loyalty and the core attributes of his personality, in addition to lowering the plaintiff’s professional and personal business and/or reputation in the estimation of right-thinking members of society. The plaintiff further claims that the Words were published with express malice and with improper motive to injure him and seeks general, aggravated and special damages against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The defendant denies the plaintiff’s claims in their entirety. The defendant denies that the Words bore any defamatory meaning. The defendant further relies on the defences of justification and qualified privilege. The defendant also takes the position that it had an honest belief in the truth of the Words published, and the Words were therefore not published maliciously. In any event, the plaintiff has not suffered any damage because of the publication of the Words.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The present summonses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Turning to the present applications, in SUM 3879, the plaintiff sought, pursuant to O 39 r 2 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”), to issue letters of request to the relevant authorities in four separate jurisdictions for the examination of eight individuals based overseas (the “Foreign Witnesses”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In SUM 4340, the plaintiff sought to subpoena three witnesses based in Singapore (the “Local Witnesses”) and for their AEICs to be dispensed with pursuant to O 38 rr 14 and 2(4) of ROC 2014 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In relation to SUM 3879, the plaintiff submitted that the evidence of the Foreign Witnesses would be necessary to determine “the extent of publication in order to achieve a fair trial”

The second issue arising from SUM 4340 was whether the applications to subpoena the Local Witnesses and for their AEICs to be dispensed with, under O 38 rr 14 and 2(4) of ROC 2014 respectively, should be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The application in SUM 3879 for the examination of the Foreign Witnesses out of jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Before examining the parties’ submissions in respect of SUM 3879, it would be helpful to set out the law relating to applications for the examination of persons out of jurisdiction. This is set out in O 39 rr 1 and 2 of ROC 2014:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power to order depositions to be taken (O. 39, r. 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1.</span>—(1) The Court may, in any cause or matter where it appears necessary for the purposes of justice, make an order in Form 73 for the examination on oath before a Judge or the Registrar or some other person, at any place, of any person.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) An order under paragraph (1) may be made on such terms (including, in particular, terms as to the giving of discovery before the examination takes place) as the Court thinks fit. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Where person to be examined is out of jurisdiction (O. 39, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>—(1) Where the person in relation to whom an order under Rule 1 is required is out of the jurisdiction, an application may be made —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) for an order in Form 74 under that Rule for the issue of a letter of request to the relevant authorities of the jurisdiction in which that person is to take, or cause to be taken, the evidence of that person; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) if the government of that jurisdiction allows a person in that jurisdiction to be examined before a person appointed by the Court, for an order in Form 75 under that Rule appointing a special examiner to take the evidence of that person in that jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 O 39 r 2(1) read with O 39 rr 1(1) and 1(2) of ROC 2014 empowers the court to order the examination of a person even if the person to be examined is out of jurisdiction. The touchstone for making such an order is whether it appears “necessary for the purposes of justice”, as set out in O 39 r 1(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The exercise of the court’s powers under these rules for the examination of a person out of jurisdiction is a matter of discretion, especially since the cost of taking evidence abroad is high and sometimes prohibitive: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 39/3/1. An application under these rules should not be the first port of call. Reasonable attempts should first be made, in a proper case, to obtain the evidence in other ways, such as through a witness who is within jurisdiction, by documents, by admissions, or an order that the evidence may be given on affidavit. The court may decline to grant the application if the evidence of the proposed witness is not material: see <span class="font-italic">Kea Meng Kwang </span><span class="font-italic">and Another v Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (Asia Pacific) Ltd and Others</span> [2006] SGHC 161 at [62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff relied on the relevance of the Foreign Witnesses as the primary factor in support of allowing the applications.

</div> The plaintiff had not shown how these issues were relevant to the disputed issues or how these issues related to the Foreign Witnesses. Furthermore, as I shall explain further below (at [32]), the plaintiff appeared to have conflated the issue of the defendant’s purported malice in its <span class="font-italic">decision to revoke the </span><span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s accreditation</span> with the issue of whether the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">making of the allegedly defamatory statements</span> was also actuated by malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiff had not disclosed the specific questions to be put to the Foreign Witnesses, despite previously having indicated that he would do so by 3 November 2022, as set out at [25] above. He averred that he was not prepared to disclose these questions to the defendant, but he was prepared to disclose the same to this court on an “ex-part[e] basis”. According to the plaintiff, disclosing such interrogatories to the defendant would have caused them to lose the “element of surprise”, which the plaintiff argued was akin to a situation “where [a] party to the Suit is directed to disclose its questions (examination or cross-examination) months ahead of the witness examination”, thereby “giving the Witnesses adequate time to consult the Defendant and its Lawyers to prepare responses to their own benefit at trial”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The plaintiff’s arguments on preserving the “element of surprise” were plainly misconceived. I am not aware of any proposition in law which affords a party to a civil suit an entitlement to such an “element of surprise”, a point on which the plaintiff had not offered any authorities in support. In fact, such “surprise” tactics should not be condoned. They would clearly be contrary to O 39 r 3(3) of ROC 2014, which expressly requires that “[i]f the evidence of the person to be examined is to be obtained by means of written questions, <span class="font-italic">there must be filed</span> with the letter of request a copy of the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to be put to him on examination” [emphasis added]. In any case, the plaintiff made no effort during the hearing on 10 February 2023 to offer disclosure (“<span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span>” or otherwise) of any of the specific questions that he purportedly had in mind to be put to the Foreign Witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The plaintiff contended that the evidence of the Foreign Witnesses would be necessary to test the defendant’s allegation that the Foreign Witnesses had acted for and on behalf of the defendant such that there was no “publication” of the Words. Furthermore, the plaintiff stressed that the Foreign Witnesses would be relevant given their role as recipients of the Words and given further that the defendant was responsible for the revocation of the plaintiff’s accreditation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, the plaintiff had failed to clearly frame the issues in dispute which he claimed that the Foreign Witnesses would be able to provide evidence on. Equally, he had not demonstrated how the evidence of the Foreign Witnesses would be relevant and/or material to the disputed issues. I was not persuaded that the evidence of the Foreign Witnesses would be relevant and material to the defences of justification or qualified privilege, the falsity of the Words and the alleged malice on the part of the defendant. Among these issues, it appeared that the only issue on which the Foreign Witnesses could possibly shed light on would be that of the alleged malice on the part of the defendant. That being said, I was not satisfied that the evidence of the Foreign Witnesses would be relevant or material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In his submissions, the plaintiff appeared to have conflated the issue of whether the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">decision to revoke </span><span class="font-italic">his accreditation</span> was actuated by malice with the issue of whether the defendant’s making of the <span class="font-italic">alleged defamatory statements</span> was actuated by malice. It is the latter issue that is relevant to the subject matter of the present dispute. In this regard, the plaintiff maintained during the hearing on 10 February 2023 that there was no such conflation and that the defendant was actuated by one and only one type of malice. The plaintiff argued that the defendant did not act bona fide in <span class="font-italic">suspending his </span><span class="font-italic">licence</span>, leading to the inference that the defamatory statements were malicious. I did not agree that any malice in the defendant’s decision to suspend his accreditation, even assuming that this could be established, must necessarily mean that malice was also similarly present in the making of the alleged defamatory Words. I was not prepared to find that such an irresistible inference or any causal connection would ineluctably arise. The UK proceedings have been resolved and involved different causes of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In any event, as the defendants pointed out in their oral submissions, Mr Howard Smith, the General Manager of the defendant who was the central figure involved in the publication of the Words, will be called to testify as a witness. They also intend to call Mr Mike Bannon, who is part of the CDI-M accreditation committee. These two witnesses should be sufficient to provide evidence on the defendant’s state of mind at the material time when the Words were published. This conclusion would take the facts of the present case outside those of <span class="font-italic">Credit Suisse v Lim Soon Fang Bryan</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 414. In that case, the court made orders for the examination of witnesses residing in Taiwan, given that they were material witnesses and that the plaintiff ran a real risk that it would not be able to call the relevant evidence if the order was not made. Furthermore, I am persuaded that the examination of the Foreign Witnesses, most of whom the plaintiff alleged were mere recipients of the Words and not their authors, would not be likely to shed further light on the defendant’s state of mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I shall briefly address one objection raised by the defendant that I did not find convincing. The defendant noted in both its written and oral submissions that the plaintiff himself appeared to accept the lack of relevance or materiality of the evidence he had sought. According to the defendant, this was because the plaintiff had expressly confirmed to the assistant registrar at a pre-trial conference on 10 January 2023 that he would proceed with the trial fixed for August 2023, even if he was unable to procure the evidence of the Foreign Witnesses in time.

</div> Based on the plaintiff’s own confirmation, the defendant suggested that the evidence he sought was merely “good to have”, rather than essential evidence. I was not satisfied that the plaintiff’s confirmation that he would nevertheless proceed with the trial had indeed gone so far as to amount to an admission of the non-materiality of the Foreign Witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As I was not satisfied that the Foreign Witnesses would provide relevant or material evidence to the issues in dispute, this alone would be sufficient basis to dismiss the plaintiff’s application in SUM 3879.

The defendant stressed that the costs of the examinations would be disproportionate as the witnesses are spread across different continents and countries. For the witnesses in the USA, UK, and Belgium, they are possibly even located in different states or cities. Each jurisdiction would necessarily have its own rules and procedures for the processing of letters of requests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In response, the plaintiff suggested in his oral submissions that the costs consideration was overstated.

</div> respectively, on the practical information relating to the handling of letters of requests in these jurisdictions. The plaintiff pointed out that in relation to the USA and the UK, it was stated that the relevant authorities rarely or would not seek reimbursement of costs relating to the execution of letters of request. I accepted that the risk of disproportionately high costs arising from the examinations would appear to be tempered in the face of the available information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, as the defendant correctly noted, there is a high possibility of delay in the proceedings given the time required by foreign jurisdictions to process the letters of request. At present, the trial for this matter has been fixed for early August 2023, which is only a few months away from the date when the present applications were being heard. According to the information provided by the various States on the website for the Hague Convention, the estimated time periods for the execution of letters of request in the USA would be two to three months for evidence obtained on a voluntary basis and three to six months for evidence that needs to be compelled. For the UK, the time taken just to process a request would usually range from six and 12 months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I would also point out that in relation to Belgium, which is not a Contracting State to the Hague Convention, the plaintiff had not adequately addressed the defendant’s objection on whether the Belgian courts would even execute letters of request from Singapore. The plaintiff cited in his written submissions the “Belgian Judicial Code”, “the European E-Justice Portal for Belgium” and the “Research Paper on obtaining evidence in Belgium”.

This is subject to the exceptional case where the court exercises its discretion under O 38 r 2(4) to allow a witness to give evidence orally:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>—(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), (2) or (3), the Court may, if it thinks just, order that evidence of a party or any witness or any part of such evidence be given orally at the trial or hearing of any cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It was within the above context that the plaintiff made his application to subpoena the Local Witnesses under O 38 r 14 of ROC 2014 and for the evidence of the Local Witnesses to be given orally under O 38 r 2(4). It was also within this context that the defendant objected to the issuance of the subpoena.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The critical issue here was whether the subpoenas to testify should be issued against the three Local Witnesses. This is because if it was found that the issuance of the subpoenas was appropriate, it followed as a matter of course that subpoenaed witnesses ought to be allowed to provide their evidence orally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I turn now to the applicable principles for issuance of subpoenas. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony </span>([20] supra) at [23], the issuance of a subpoena to testify requires the court to determine whether the proposed witness is in a position to provide oral and documentary evidence that is not just relevant to the issues in dispute but which could have materially affected the outcome of some or all of the live disputes before the court. In making this determination, the court has to bear in mind the following principles (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony</span> at [24]–[26]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 At this juncture, we would emphasise that every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence relevant to his or her case to the attention of the court. This general right is so fundamental that it requires no authority to be cited in support of it; in fact, to say that the right derives from some positive decision or rule is to understate its constitutive importance to the adversarial approach to fact-finding. The importance of the right is reflected in the fact that a litigant may pray in aid the machinery of the court to compel, on the pain of contempt, all persons who are in a position to give relevant evidence, to come forward and give it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 The general right is, of course, subject to specific limits. For present purposes, the following limits are germane. A litigant only has the right to adduce relevant evidence, as defined by the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and other applicable rules; irrelevant evidence is inadmissible and will not be considered by the court. The adduction of relevant evidence must, as far as practicable, take place in accordance with the rules of procedure whose purpose is to ensure the fair, economical, swift and orderly resolution of a dispute. Finally, a litigant is prohibited from manipulating the court’s machinery to further his ulterior or collateral motives in an abusive or oppressive manner.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 In striking the proper balance between the general right and the specific limits, a trial judge must not only be guided by the applicable rules and decisions, but must look beyond the mechanical application of these rules and decisions, and carefully assess the interests at stake in every case to ensure that a fair outcome is reached through the application of fair processes. It should always be borne in mind that grave consequences might flow from the wrongful exclusion of evidence (such as by shutting out a witness from testifying or preventing cross-examination). In cases where the relevance of evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful, we are of the view that it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion. With specific regard to the calling of witnesses, we would reiterate what was said in <span class="font-italic">Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine Services v Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 427 (at [17]), where this court allowed an appeal to introduce eleven new witnesses of fact after the summons for directions stage:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A] balance should be struck between the need to comply with the rules and the parties’ right to call witnesses whom they deem necessary to establish their case. It may well be that the additional evidence to be adduced by the parties may assist in illuminating the issues before the court or result in the expeditious disposal of the proceedings. If, however, it really turns out at the trial that the evidence adduced is unnecessary, irrelevant or vexatious, the trial judge is in full control and is in a position to deal with the party adducing such evidence in an appropriate way, such as by disallowing the evidence which is being elicited from the witness and/or by an order as to costs. It must always be borne in mind that the duty of the court is to examine all the evidence put forward by the parties which is material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to shut out potentially material and relevant evidence by a strict adherence to the rules of civil procedure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 While the court would tend to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion considering the grave consequences of prematurely shutting out evidence, the evidence must be relevant and material to the issues in dispute. On the relevance and materiality of the Local Witnesses, the parties naturally took differing positions. On the one hand, the plaintiff submitted that examination of the Local Witnesses would shed light on the issues in dispute. The Local Witnesses and their designations at the material time are as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">S/N</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Name</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Designation at the material time</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Ian Mann (“Mr Mann”)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">CDI-M Singapore-based inspector</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Vijay Rangroo (“Mr Rangroo”)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Managing Director of MTMSM</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Jayanta Dutta (“Mr Dutta”)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Employee of MTMSM</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 According to the plaintiff, Mr Mann’s evidence would be relevant and/or material for two reasons. Firstly, the defendant affirmed that it had deleted the emails containing the 6th and 8th set of Words. In the absence of the emails where these two sets of Words were circulated, the plaintiff submitted that it would be crucial that at least one individual (being Mr Mann), who was physically present at the meeting and who was a recipient of these two sets of Words, be examined as a witness.

Firstly, the defendant had not disclosed documents relating to correspondences between MTMSM and the defendant pursuant to a specific discovery order made in HC/SUM 3543/2022. In the absence of these documents, the examination of Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo would be relevant to determine the meaning of the set of Words and the defendant’s motive and state of mind when it published the Words. Secondly, the defendant claimed that it acted to suspend and later revoke the plaintiff’s accreditation upon the receipt of a single complaint by Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo. As these witnesses were also recipients of the Words, the examination of these witnesses would shed light on the issues of the defence of justification, the defence of qualified privilege”, the falsity of the Words and the alleged malice on the part of the defendant.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Having considered the points above, I found that the plaintiff had not shown that the evidence of the Local Witnesses would be relevant and/or material to the issues in dispute. Specifically, I did not see how the evidence of the Local Witnesses would assist in shedding light on the defendant’s state of mind in publishing the Words. As the defendant pointed out, these witnesses were employees of third parties at the material times. They were not representatives of the defendant, nor were they authorised by the defendant to act for any particular purpose. Furthermore, I agreed with the defendant that all three witnesses were mere recipients of the Words. I found it difficult to see how they would be able to shed much light on the state of mind of the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In relation to Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo, it also appeared that the plaintiff was seeking to adduce the evidence of both these witnesses in his attempt to challenge the defendant’s suspension of his accreditation. However, this was irrelevant to the issues in the present dispute. This was evident from the submissions the plaintiff himself had made on the relevance and/or materiality of the evidence of Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo. According to the plaintiff, MTMSM was the party that made the complaint which eventually led to the suspension and revocation of his accreditation. Hence, Mr Dutta’s evidence would be necessary since he was placed on suspension following the complaint contained in an email from Mr Dutta. In relation to Mr Rangroo, he would also be a “key witness in this action” as the complaint would have been discussed with Mr Rangroo before it was formally made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In his oral submissions, the plaintiff sought to further explain why the evidence of Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo would be essential. He asserted that this was because the defendant had yet to disclose documents relating to correspondences between MTMSM and the Defendant which had been ordered to be disclosed pursuant to a specific discovery order made in HC/SUM 3543/2022. In the absence of these documents, there would have been no other way for him to make his case without the testimony of Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo. According to the plaintiff, the correspondence would point towards collusion between MTMSM and the defendant in bringing the complaint against him. The plaintiff questioned whether there was a common interest between MTMSM and the defendant to ensure the plaintiff’s suspension and revocation. The plaintiff went on to insinuate that this collusion could have arisen due to the results of the last inspection the plaintiff did for MTMSM being unsatisfactory to the latter given that he had found a number of non-conformities. I indicated during the course of the hearing that I was not prepared to consider this argument given that this was new evidence which was not contained within the plaintiff’s affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiff’s grounds for requiring subpoenas for Mr Dutta and Mr Rangroo involved little more than speculation on his part as to how their evidence might be relevant or material to his case.  Perhaps more importantly, the plaintiff’s chief focus appeared to be on impugning the correctness of the defendant’s decision to suspend and revoke his accreditation. However, this is not an issue to be determined in HC/S 30/2022, which involves the plaintiff’s claims of defamation and malicious falsehoods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In relation to the plaintiff’s argument that the evidence of the Local Witnesses would be crucial to determine the extent of publication of the Words, I was not satisfied that this remained a valid justification in the face of the defendant’s confirmation that there is no dispute as to the extent of the publication of the Words.

The plaintiff’s belief was that Mr Mann could testify as to whether the published Words were accurate or not. Any discrepancies in the minutes could indicate malicious intent on the defendant's part. However, the meetings where Mr Mann was present took place about five or more years ago. It was highly speculative but also quite improbable that Mr Mann could confirm or disconfirm the accuracy of the published Words. At any rate, it was not possible for the Plaintiff to say whether Mr Mann even had any recollection of what was spoken during the meetings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Inspector Working Group Meeting #4 and #5 on 16 March 2017 and 14 March 2018 respectively) where Mr Mann was purportedly present.

Despite repeated warnings this had continued to the extent that CDI felt it was damaging the functionality of CDI and CDI’s reputation. … The matter was referred to the CDI-Marine Executive Board, who requested an interview with the inspector, so he could explain his continued abusive pricing actions. In strict compliance with anti-trust and competition guidelines the Executive Board were unanimous in their decision and subsequently revoked his CDI-Marine Accreditation. GM highlighted that inspectors should be aware that the Executive Board takes such matters of pricing abuse very seriously and can and will, take action where it is deemed appropriate.
