In respect of a series of four scalding incidents which resulted in the Child’s death on 23 October 2016, they were charged with murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). After trial, I amended these murder charges and convicted Azlin and Ridzuan on newly framed charges based on the scalding incidents. I also convicted Azlin and Ridzuan on the charges for the acts of abuse, save for one on which they were acquitted. Azlin was sentenced to 27 years’ imprisonment and 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning, while Ridzuan was sentenced to 27 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. I now furnish the grounds for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the time of the offences, the accused persons, then 24 years of age, were the parents of six children.

</div> Subsequent investigation revealed a series of offences from July to 22 October 2016. At trial, the Prosecution proceeded on six charges against Azlin, and nine charges against Ridzuan. The charges against Azlin were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) one charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 and punishable under s 302(2) of the Penal Code, for incidents spanning 15 to 22 October 2016 (as amended on the second day of trial and marked “C1A”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) two charges under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2010 Rev Ed) (“CYPA”) for incidents in August 2016 (marked “C2” and “C3”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) one charge under s 324 read with s 109 of the Penal Code for an incident in end August to early September 2016 (marked “C4”) corresponding to Ridzuan’s charge for the same act below marked D4; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) two charges under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CYPA read with s 34 of the Penal Code for incidents in October 2016 (marked “C5” and “C6”) and corresponding to Ridzuan’s charges marked D7 and D9 respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Ridzuan was tried on the following charges:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) one charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code for incidents spanning 15–22 October 2016 (as amended on the second day of trial and marked “D1A”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) three charges under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CYPA for incidents in July 2016 and October 2016 (marked “D2”, “D3”, and “D6”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) three charges under s 324 of the Penal Code for incidents in end-August to early September, early October, and 18–19 October 2016 (marked “D4”, “D5”, and “D8”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) two charges under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CYPA read with s 34 of the Penal Code for incidents in October 2016 (marked “D7” and “D9”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In these grounds of decision, I refer to charges C1A and D1A as “the Murder Charges”.

On 19 September 2019, however, they notified defence counsel of their decision to try all the charges together. Counsel for Ridzuan did not object. Counsel for Azlin objected, on the basis that the joinder would be prejudicial to Azlin’s defence; alternatively, counsel requested for a vacation of the first tranche of trial dates fixed for 15–17 and 22–25 October 2019.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> At the subsequent pre-trial conference on 7 October 2019, I vacated the October trial dates but allowed the joinder of the charges at a single trial. The trial then convened on the allocated dates in November 2019, with subsequent dates added in 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The objection to the joining of the charges was renewed by counsel for Azlin in closing submissions and I deal with the objections here. It was not disputed that the grounds for joining of those offences under s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) were satisfied. Azlin objected to the trial of these offences together on the basis that the she would be prejudiced or embarrassed in her defence as the evidence amounted to similar fact evidence and argued for the need for separate trials by virtue of s 146 of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 569 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng</span>”) at [57], Yong Pung How CJ noted that whether a judge should order a joinder is governed by wholly different considerations from the question whether similar fact evidence should be admitted. A judge, as the trier of fact and in contrast to a jury, is endowed with the judicial ability to preserve and apply the rule against similar facts and may treat the evidence of different incidents separately. Whether a joinder is appropriate in such a case as the present is governed by what is now s 133 of the CPC (previously, s 169: see <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng</span> at [58]). There is no dispute that s 133 of the CPC was satisfied in this case. On this point, the Abuse Charges were relevant in setting the context for the Murder Charges, and the offences “form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The question then, was whether the joint trial of the offences would prejudice the accused or embarrass her in her defence such that the court should exercise its powers under s 146 of the CPC to order a separate trial: see <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng</span> at [59]. The concept of “similar fact evidence” was not relevant in the present case as it protects against the potential prejudice caused by proof of acts of past misconduct in relation to the proof of other offences. In the present case, however, the <span class="font-italic">actus</span> of each of these offences arose from her own admissions in her undisputed statements. The facts of these past offences were independently relevant and therefore distinguished from similar fact evidence: see <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng</span> at [36]. As is made clear by Illustrations <span class="font-italic">(i)</span>, (<span class="font-italic">o</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">p</span>) in s 14 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”), evidence of habit or general disposition are not relevant but facts illuminating intent are. The state of mind of Azlin over the time period in question and the context in which the offence was committed were relevant under s 14 of the Evidence Act. Because the incidents of the Abuse Charges formed part of a series in the lead up to the Murder Charges, they cast light on the intention and knowledge of Azlin and Ridzuan which, as these grounds explain, were crucial to the determination of their case and sentencing.  The evidence was admissible in law; joint trial was appropriate, and did not cause any prejudice.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Counsel for Azlin raised a further argument in closing submissions that was not raised prior to trial. This is that Azlin would have testified in her defence for the Abuse Charges, but chose not to because of the Murder Charge. To the contrary, Azlin did not dispute three of the Abuse Charges, and the source for the evidence for the remaining charges was her own statements, which she had conceded were voluntary. In my view, the facts well show that Azlin was not prejudiced by her election not to give evidence on any of the charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I start, then, with the Abuse Charges, which inform the context for the Murder Charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Abuse Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">July and August CYPA charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The series of offences commenced in July, with CYPA offences committed by Ridzuan against the Child. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Section 5(1) of the CYPA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person shall be guilty of an offence if, being a person who has the custody, charge or care of a child or young person, he ill-treats the child or young person or causes, procures or knowingly permits the child or young person to be ill-treated by any other person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Section 5(2) of the CYPA provides a list that defines the scope of “ill-treats” under the CYPA.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The case against Ridzuan (in relation to D4) rested solely on Azlin’s statement. In my view, Azlin’s statement did not amount to a “confession” for the purposes of s 285(5) of the CPC and therefore could not be used: see [32] below. Even putting that aside, I was of the view that it would not, in any event, be safe to convict Ridzuan on this charge purely on the basis of Azlin’s statement. There were multiple incidents, and she could easily have been confused about the timing of each occurrence. More fundamentally, I considered Ridzuan’s omission to mention an end-August incident to be exculpatory. This was because his statements had been largely truthful, and his convictions on the Abuse Charges rested on the inculpatory parts of his statements. An accused’s statements have to considered in their whole context: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Kin Choi v Public Prosecutor</span> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 111 at [34]. There was therefore a reasonable doubt as to whether there had indeed been a heated metal spoon incident at the end of August and it was unsafe to convict Ridzuan of this charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Azlin’s charge (“C4”) was for instigation of the above offence, and read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">AZLIN BINTE ARUJUNAH</span>, … sometime between end August 2016 and early September 2016, at [xxx], Singapore, did abet by instigating one Ridzuan Bin Mega Abdul Rahman to commit an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by means of heated substance against [the Child] (male, 5 years old), <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by using a heated metal spoon to burn the right palm of [the Child], causing a blister on his palm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 324 read with s 109 of the Penal code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I acquitted Azlin on this charge for the following reasons. First, what was alleged to be her instigation was framed in P207 as a request to Ridzuan to discipline the Child: “… I just could not control [the Child]. I just told Ridzuan and told Ridzuan to deal with [the Child]”.

</div> There was no “‘active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement’ of the primary offence”: <span class="font-italic">Chan Heng Kong and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] SGCA 18 at [34]. In this context, Ridzuan’s understanding of what Azlin intended by her request to “deal with” the Child did not involve the specifics of a heated spoon. In his statement, he stated: “She knew that I would shout and hit [the Child] and that was the reason why my wife had asked me to deal with [the Child]. She thinks that [the Child] would be scared”.

After that, my wife put the hot water aside and pushed [the Child]. As a result of the push, [the Child’s] head hit the wall and some blood flowed from his head. My wife will usually push [the Child] around when she gets angry. I was also angry at that time as [the Child] refuses [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to answer a simple question.

Section 258(5) of the CPC permitted such use of Ridzuan’s statement as Azlin and Ridzuan were charged for the same incident under s 34 of the Penal Code and were tried jointly for the same offence, and Ridzuan’s statement amounted to a confession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I preferred Ridzuan’s version of events over Azlin’s. Azlin’s answers in P208 appeared to indicate that she was not aware of when the October head injury incident happened. However, it was clear that the injuries arising from that incident were serious ones. Dr Chan had observed lacerations on the upper lip, comminuted fractures of the nasal bone, and fractures of the alveolar process of the maxilla.

</div> Azlin herself noted that the Child’s nose was flat and he was missing two front teeth. In the light of such obvious injury, her assertion, “I cannot remember when”, could not be believed, especially given her ability to remember when the other incidents occurred, and appeared to be an attempt to distance herself from a serious incident. This would be consistent with her change of mind in April 2018 when she admitted to pushing the Child’s head against the wall in October. Coming to Ridzuan’s statement in this context, as mentioned at [30] above, Ridzuan’s account in his statements appeared to be largely truthful. He was clear, from the outset, that he was responsible for the various acts of abuse that he was charged with, and cooperated with investigations from the first approach of the police. His account of the incident in his statement was consistent with Dr Chan’s medical evidence. Ridzuan also had no motive to falsely implicate Azlin; no such motives were alleged or proved (see <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 820 at [59], citing <span class="font-italic">Khoo Kwoon Hain v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591). I therefore accepted as proven beyond reasonable doubt that Azlin had pushed the Child, causing him to hit his head against the wall, and that Ridzuan had punched the Child on the face. The physical injuries thus caused amounted to ill-treatment under s 5(1) of the CYPA. I noted, however, as counsel for Azlin pointed out, the words “pushing his head against the wall” in the charge suggested that Azlin had pushed the Child’s head against the wall, rather than simply having pushed the Child causing him to hit his head. I agreed that the charges conveyed a false impression and amended the charges C5 and D7 accordingly to read “by pushing him, causing his head to hit the wall” instead of “pushing his head against the wall”. The amended charges (marked C5A and D7A respectively) were read to the accused persons on 19 June 2020. Defence counsel confirmed that no further evidence was required. Azlin claimed trial to the charge while Ridzuan pleaded guilty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I turn to the issue of common intention. Azlin and Ridzuan were present at the same time and disciplined the Child together. The common intention could be inferred from the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) This act occurred in the context of an escalation in acts of violence against the Child. Both had used physical force against the Child by 15 October 2016. They were both present at the scene at this incident, and clearly acting in concert towards a common objective.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Regarding Azlin’s push which started the incident, Ridzuan’s statement revealed that he knew Azlin was likely to push the Child. He was angry as well and wanted an answer to the question. He not only acquiesced in Azlin’s act while participating in disciplining the Child, but then escalated it further by punching the Child.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ridzuan’s punch was in furtherance of their common intention. Azlin acquiescence supported this inference. There is no evidence that she tried to distance herself or to stop Ridzuan while the discipline was on-going. The inference is buttressed by the fact that Ridzuan’s act was directed at the same goal that Azlin had, namely to get the Child to answer the question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Therefore, I found the elements of s 5(1) of the CYPA read with s 34 of the Penal Code satisfied. I convicted Azlin and Ridzuan of C5A and D7A (as amended), respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The final Abuse Charge took place between 21 and 22 October 2016, the period in which the third and fourth scalding incidents took place. Azlin and Ridzuan put the Child in a cat cage.  Charges C6 and D9 mirrored each other. I set out D9 here for reference:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">RIDZUAN BIN MEGA ABDUL RAHMAN</span>, … sometime between 21 October 2016 and 22 October 2016, at [xxx], Singapore, together with Azlin Binte Arujunah, being persons who have the care of a child, namely, [the Child] (male, 5 years old), did ill-treat the said child, in the furtherance of the common intention of you both, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by confining the said child in a cage, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(5)(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Azlin and Ridzuan explained in their statements that they kept the Child locked in the cage so that he would not get into any more trouble and so they would not have to cause any more hurt to the Child.

</div> The cat cage was not large enough for the Child to stand or lie stretched out, except maybe diagonally. Dr Chan was given the opportunity to inspect the cage and she commented that it was possible that the lacerations on the Child’s face and scalp “might have been a result of being confined in a cage.” She had observed that the cage had a few areas where the ends of the metal bars were sharper, running along the cage and not protruding out. Injury could result if someone confined inside moved around.

</div> Given Ridzuan’s admission that there were blood stains in the cat cage, the size of the cage, and Dr Chan’s observations, I found that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the Child would have suffered emotional injury, unnecessary physical suffering, and injury to his health, all relevant forms of injury under s 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CYPA. Their joint and agreed action constituted ill treatment under s 5(1) of the CYPA. I convicted Azlin and Ridzuan of C6 and D9 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Abuse Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The various convictions on the Abuse Charges shed light on the suffering of the Child in the lead up and during the time of the Murder Charges. In summary, Ridzuan first applied pliers to the Child twice in July. This was followed in August by Azlin hitting the Child with a broomstick so hard that he was limping thereafter. Later in August, she pushed him so hard that he fell, hitting his head on the edge of a pillar; this injury resulted in his bleeding from the head. In October, there was an escalation of abuse, with Ridzuan using a heated spoon on the Child’s palm, flicking ash from a lit cigarette, and hitting him with a hanger. After 15 October, Ridzuan again injured him with a heated spoon. In the same period of time that the scalding events were taking place, Azlin and Ridzuan acted in concert to cause the Child further injury. In one incident, the Child was punched so hard his nasal bone was fractured. Towards the end of the period, he was put into a cat cage, where he suffered further injury. These offences set important context for the Murder Charges, to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Murder Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Azlin’s Murder Charge read as follows (Ridzuan’s was substantially similar): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">AZLIN BINTE ARUJUNAH</span>, between 15 October 2016 to 22 October 2016 (both dates inclusive), at [xxx], Singapore, together with Ridzuan Bin Mega Abdul Rahman and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did commit murder by causing the death of [the Child] (male, 5 years old), <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by intentionally inflicting severe scald injuries on him, which injuries are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34, and punishable under s 302(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Murder Charges were framed under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">300. </span>Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Culpable homicide is defined under s 299 of the Penal Code:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">299.</span> Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54  The Murder Charges also rely on s 34 of the Penal Code, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of issues and decision for the Murder Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In  order to prove the Murder Charges under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution had to prove the following elements: (a) that death has been caused by the acts of the accused; (b) that the bodily injury inflicted is in the ordinary nature sufficient to cause death; and (c) that the act resulting in bodily injury was done with the intention of causing that bodily injury to the accused: <span class="font-italic">Wang Wenfeng v Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor</span> [2012] 4 SLR 590 (“<span class="font-italic">Wang Wenfeng</span>”) at [32].

In my view, <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> requires that where an accused is charged under s 300(c) read with s 34 of the Penal Code, the following three elements would be required for each accused: (a) death has been caused by the criminal act in which both accused participated; (b) the bodily injury so caused is in the ordinary nature sufficient to cause death; and (c) both have the common intention to cause “s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury” as defined in Daniel Vijay at [49]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Regarding these elements, neither accused person challenged the participation element. Their participation was detailed in their statements, which were admitted. The criminal act element was also not disputed, save for its legal effect. The Prosecution particularised the “criminal act” as “the collective acts of scalding by both accused persons over four incidents within the week that resulted in the [Child]’s Severe Scald Injury [referred to in these grounds as “the Cumulative Scald Injury”] and eventual death.”

</div> The use of several incidents forming the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of the offence was also not disputed. What the sufficient common intention for these s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charges was and whether such common intention could be inferred from the facts were the primary issues in dispute. It was argued that neither Azlin nor Ridzuan intended the Cumulative Scald Injury nor did they share the common intention to cause the Cumulative Scald Injury. The defence also countered that the Cumulative Scald Injury was not, as required under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, the cause of death nor, in the ordinary cause of nature, sufficient to cause death. Lastly, Azlin and Ridzuan argued Exception 7 was applicable, and they were therefore in any event only to be held liable under s 299 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The issues in dispute, therefore, may be analysed in the following order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Cumulative Scald Injury was the cause of death, and whether it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Azlin and Ridzuan possessed the common intention necessary for the Murder Charges; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if (b) was satisfied, whether either Azlin or Ridzuan could rely on Exception 7of the Penal Code; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) if (b) was not satisfied, whether the charges should be amended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I answered (a) in the positive, but held (b) was not satisfied.

Azlin suspected that the Child had taken milk powder and grabbed the Child by his right ankle. While still holding onto him, Azlin then filled a glass mug to around one-quarter full with hot water from the water dispenser and poured that water onto his right leg. Azlin then re-filled the glass to one-quarter full and poured the water again. She did this two or three times, before letting the Child go. When Azlin questioned the Child again about the milk powder, the Child denied his involvement and Azlin refilled the mug with hot water and poured hot water on the Child’s hand four to five times. When the Child got free of her grip, she refilled the mug and splashed it over his left arm, and some also splashed onto his chest. She stopped when Ridzuan woke up and shouted for them to keep quiet. After the incident, Azlin saw that the Child was limping and that skin was peeling from his hands, arms and chest. She then went to a provision shop to buy some cream for the Child’s skin.

The fluid loss due to the burns led to a lower volume of circulating blood, which induced a “shock state” in which the circulating blood was insufficient to bring oxygen and nutrients to parts of the body and to remove waste.

First, “blunt force craniofacial trauma” was listed by Dr Chan as a secondary cause of death, but her firm conclusion, both in her report and at trial, was that the cause of death was the Cumulative Scald Injury. The uncontroverted expert evidence was that in the absence of that trauma, the Child would have died from the Cumulative Scald Injury.

It is the role of doctors to attempt life-saving medical treatment after all, and surely, life and death could not, in that context, be a matter to be resolved by statistics. His comments do not detract from the weight of the evidence on the likely outcome of such severe burn injuries. The legal test is not injury that leads inevitably to death, but rather, injury that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. In my judgment, the evidence established, beyond doubt, that the Cumulative Scald Injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on medical evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It is useful, at this juncture, to sum up the medical evidence. Three points were accepted by all three doctors. First, the extent of the injuries suffered as a result of each of the four incidents could not be established. Only the resulting Cumulative Scald Injury could be analysed. Second, the contributory effect of each of these incidents to the Child’s death was also not ascertainable. Third, it was the Cumulative Scald Injury, caused over the four incidents, which was sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death. This was the reason that the “act” which was asserted to be culpable homicide in legal terms was a series of acts over the four incidents. Section 33 of the Penal Code as it stood at the time of the offences provided that an “act” included “a series of acts”. While the current s 33(2) of the Penal Code, which provides specifically for causation when it is not known which particular act caused the effect, was not yet in force at the time of the offences, there was no dispute that the acts in this case comprised these four incidents and that the Cumulative Scald Injury was the result of this series of acts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Did Ridzuan and Azlin possess the requisite intention?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Ridzuan and Azlin contended that they did not possess the common intention to inflict the Cumulative Scald Injury. Both Murder Charges relied upon s 34 of the Penal Code, which required such common intention. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">When must the common intention be formed?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It was common ground that although there does not need to be “a prior plan” to commit the offence, and a plan could arise “on the spot”, the common intention must <span class="font-italic">precede</span> the commission of the criminal act: <span class="font-italic">Shaiful Edham bin Adam</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 442 at [60], citing <span class="font-italic">Asogan Ramesh s/o Ramachandren v Public Prosecutor</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 201 at [34]; see also <span class="font-italic">Samlee Prathumtree and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 841 at [36]. In the present case, because the Cumulative Scald Injury was caused by a series of four incidents, it was not disputed that the requisite common intention must have existed prior to Incident 1, although it was open to the court to infer from subsequent acts, as a matter of drawing inferences from the evidence, that the common intention existed from the outset. The content of the necessary common intention and whether it could be inferred from the facts were the subject of dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Why was common intention necessary?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the present case, common intention was a necessary ingredient for the Murder Charges because the Cumulative Scald Injury was the result of four separate incidents over the course of about a week. Ridzuan was not present for Incidents 1 and 3, and he appeared to have no knowledge, even after Incident 4, of Incident 3. In Incident 2, where both contributed to acts of scalding, their actions would need to be attributed to each other. In Incident 4, while Azlin called Ridzuan’s attention to the scene, it was Ridzuan who was responsible for the acts of scalding. Because of the nature of scalding, the medical evidence was not able to show the extent of burns caused by each particular incident, or how each incident contributed to the Child’s death. As such, it was the Cumulative Scald Injury, resulting from all four incidents, which caused the Child’s death. In that context, both Azlin and Ridzuan were responsible for different physical components of Incidents 1 to 4 that resulted in the Cumulative Scald Injury. The mechanism of s 34 of the Penal Code was required to hold both Azlin and Ridzuan accountable for the entirety of the criminal act that formed the subject matter of the Murder Charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Content of the common intention required</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal expressly differentiated between the intention required of an offender individually charged with an offence, and that required in a case where common intention was used to impose liability, holding at [76]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]e are of the view that he [the secondary offender] should not be made constructively liable for the offence of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) murder arising from the actual doer’s criminal act <span class="font-italic">unless there is a common intention to cause, specifically, a s 300(c) injury, and not any other type of injury.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 This distinction was made after Chan Sek Keong CJ defined “s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury” to refer to the entire concept of “bodily injury that is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death” at [49].

A distinction was drawn between the criminal act itself and the injury. This distinction was incorrect insofar as it suggested that the common intention required did not require reference to the injury caused. The Court of Appeal throughout <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> understood the “very criminal act” that had to be intended under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code to be the infliction of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. This could be seen by the scenarios (b) and (c) used in <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [168] where, in respect of the “criminal act” to which s 34 of the Penal Code applied, the Court of Appeal again referred to the infliction of “s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In summary, in order for constructive liability to be imposed under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code, the offenders must share a common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury, and not any other type of injury, meaning that the fact that the injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death must be intended. In my view, cases subsequent to <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) have applied the test similarly, and I turn to explain why I disagreed with the Prosecution on their characterisations to the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98  <span class="font-italic">Michael Anak Garing v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Michael Anak Garing</span>”) [2017] 1 SLR 748 was cited by the Prosecution.

I note that the Court of Appeal’s comment was not directed to the issue of common intention, but was made in the context of determining TAI’s mental state <span class="font-italic">for the purposes of sentencing</span>, since his awareness of <span class="font-italic">how</span> MAG would attack the deceased was a relevant factor in determining his culpability and whether he showed a blatant disregard for human life: <span class="font-italic">Michael Anak Garing</span> at [56], [61]. This was an additional fact that went beyond the issue of the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>. The Court of Appeal’s decision in respect of TAI, the secondary offender, was only in respect of sentencing, as TAI had withdrawn his appeal against conviction: <span class="font-italic">Michael Anak Garing</span> at [4]. In commenting on TAI’s state of mind, the Court of Appeal was not, in fact, reviewing whether TAI had the necessary intention under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. When discussing the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> for s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code at [55], the Court of Appeal simply explained that the requisite intention was “the intention to inflict on the deceased injury of the type specified in s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code”, by reference to <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> ([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [167] and <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([55] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]–[33].

The Court of Appeal, in respect of the two secondary offenders, held that even if there was a finding on the evidence that the appellants had a common intention to beat the deceased on the head to render him unconscious, it would not necessarily follow that this common intention was a common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury on Wan, the deceased (see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay </span>at [147]). The Court of Appeal pointed out that there was no scientific evidence that any knock on the head with a baseball bat would be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> ([55] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), in the course of a robbery, Jabing (the primary offender) killed the victim with blows to the head with a piece of wood. Galing had also assaulted the victim with a belt buckle. The fatal injuries were inflicted by Jabing: <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> at [27], [28] and [31]. The Court of Appeal held that it was impossible to infer that Galing had the common intention to cause the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. The Court of Appeal at [35] went on to discuss the factors that militated against drawing the inference of the common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury on the victim, which were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) While Galing and Jabing had a common intention to commit robbery at Geylang, there was no evidence of any prior discussions or planning between the two of them as to how the robbery would be carried out, whether any weapons would be used, what force should be used if the victims resisted, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Galing and Jabing were unarmed when they decided to rob the two victims. Jabing’s picking up and using the piece of wood was opportunistic and improvisational and Galing’s use of his belt was equally so (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, hardly part of a “pre-arranged plan”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There was insufficient evidence as to what kind of injury was caused by Galing using his belt buckle and, unless Galing had used it to strike the deceased very hard on the head (and there was no evidence that this had occurred) it could not have been a s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) kind of injury.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Although Galing was in a position, and afforded the opportunity, to inflict more severe wounds on the deceased, the fact that he did not do so suggested that his intention all along was to rob, as well as cause hurt while doing so, and not to inflict a s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Galing did not assault the deceased in a manner which would have made it easier for Jabing to cause the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by distracting the deceased, or restraining or incapacitating him so that Jabing would have been presented with a more vulnerable victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([100] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), a case where the fatal blow could not be identified, the Court of Appeal held that the requisite common intention could be inferred from the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Court of Appeal noted that Chia was the “mastermind of the plan to abduct the Deceased from the car park and to beat him up severely”: <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [90];</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, during the assault, “Chia actively assisted in Febri’s assault by restraining the Deceased’s legs while Febri went ‘crazy’ and repeatedly struck the Deceased’s head with the hammer. At no point did Chia attempt to stop Febri from continuing the assault, even though Chia was in a position to do so, since he had recruited Febri solely to assist him and Febri had no interest in the assault other than to act at Chia’s behest”: <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [92]. The reason why Chia did not stop Febri was because he was angry. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Chia also asked Febri to hand him the hammer, and he then struck the deceased on the forehead. He then returned the hammer to Febri, allowing him to continue striking the deceased. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the Court of Appeal also noted various parts of the statements that made clear that Chia had wanted the deceased dead: <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [94].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> deal squarely with counsel for Ridzuan’s submission that there could be no agreement if Ridzuan was unaware of the third incident. I disagreed with that approach. Ridzuan’s ignorance of the third incident would be irrelevant <span class="font-italic">if</span> the common intention could be proved. This is clear from <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [89] (extracted above at [102]). It is the common intention that is important.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Prosecution’s argument on the facts upon which to found common intention in this case was summarised at para 69 of their written submissions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Both accused were in agreement that the Deceased was “misbehaving” and that more severe measures had to be inflicted on him to ensure his obedience. While the act of scalding the Deceased by splashing hot water on him indiscriminately was initiated by Azlin, Ridzuan plainly endorsed and participated in that method in the second and fourth incidents. They took turns to brutally assault him by scalding, knowing full well that the other was also assaulting him in the same way, and that the cumulative effect of their assault was to cause severe burn injury. That injury was subsequently ascertained to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In considering whether such common intention existed, it was important to bear in mind the kind of injury at hand, which was the Cumulative Scald Injury, accumulated across four incidents, that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. In ascertaining intention, it was also important to consider the knowledge that Azlin and Ridzuan would have had, as the awareness of what kind of injury and the seriousness of the injury that would be caused is very relevant for inferring the necessary common intention. In this case, however, the scald injuries were not as obvious as other kinds of injury. It can be contrasted with a blunt force blow to the head with a hammer, which <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([100] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>involved, which injuries would have been obvious. Similar reasoning was employed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) when it suggested at [167], regarding the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mimi Wong </span>Criminal Case No 17 of 1970, that the combination of the facts that the common intention was to inflict bodily injury with a knife and that the knife injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, <span class="font-italic">likely</span> <span class="font-italic">justified the inference</span> that there was a common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. By contrast, in other cases, the nature of the weapons or injuries militated against an inference of common intention. In <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([55] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), for example, the weapons used by the robbers Jabing and Galing were improvisational, and it could not be inferred from Galing’s use of a belt that there was a pre-arranged plan for the victim to suffer head trauma from Jabing’s use of a piece of wood.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In my judgment, the Murder Charges were not made out, because there was insufficient evidence upon which I could infer that Azlin and Ridzuan intended to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury (defining such injury in the same way as the Court of Appeal did in <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> ([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [49]). My reasons were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no evidence of any pre-arranged plan on the part of Azlin and Ridzuan regarding the extent of injury to be caused to the Child. Rather than showing that the acts from the outset were directed at a goal of inflicting s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, fatal injury), the evidence indicates instead that each incident was a reaction to a particular trigger. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If there was such a pre-arranged plan, it should have existed prior to or have been formed on the spot just before Incident 1. Ridzuan, however, did not participate in Incident 1. The evidence indicates that he was aware of it thereafter and did not remonstrate Azlin in respect of it, but, without more, his acquiescence after the fact could not ground an inference that a common intention was formed prior to or just before the fact. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) After the second incident, Azlin and Ridzuan rinsed off the Child. Ridzuan also told Azlin to “cool down”. There was no agreement to scald the Child again. Further, after Incidents 1 and 2, Azlin and/or Ridzuan applied medication to the Child, suggesting that each incident was a separate reactive response and that there was no intention to cause any aggregate injury that would be s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) After the second incident, Ridzuan was aware that Azlin might scald the Child again. Azlin, too, was aware that Ridzuan might do the same. But foreseeability of another scalding incident alone was insufficient to ground the necessary inference that they had come to a common intention to continue scalding the Child to cause injury that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Despite the medical evidence, the Prosecution relied on areas circled out by Azlin and Ridzuan in photos showing injuries after the second incident, and Dr Kang’s view that these would show 12% or 20% of TBSA respectively. They thus drew a distinction between the injuries after Incident 2 and those after Incident 1, concluding from the comparative seriousness of the injuries after Incident 2 that the injuries from Incident 1 had been subsumed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I rejected this submission for two reasons. First, the rough drawings by accused persons would not have been an accurate reflection of the extent of the burns. The drawings do not appear to have been intended to be precise but seemed to have been made in broad strokes. This was not a reliable basis upon which to premise any criminal conviction. Second, there was no reliable evidence that the injuries from Incident 1 were minor or were “subsumed”. Furthermore, as Dr Kang testified, where a patient had already suffered a burn over an area and was burned again on that same area, the burn would become a “deeper burn”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a more serious one.

</div> Hence, wherever a burn from Incident 2 overlapped with an earlier one, it would be more severe, because of the pre-existing burn from Incident 1. The Prosecution could not rule out that the injuries from Incident 1 continued to contribute to the cause of death. In arguing to the contrary, the learned deputy public prosecutor relied upon Azlin’s and Ridzuan’s observations in their statements to argue that Incident 1 was minor. But, as summarised at [62] above, Azlin’s and Ridzuan’s accounts differ (with Azlin’s account suggesting more serious injuries), and when asked about Azlin’s observations as to the Child’s injuries after this incident, Dr Kang and Dr Loh were of the view that there were “at least partial thickness burns”.

</div>
</div> There was no evidence to show that Incident 1 was not a contributory factor to the Cumulative Scald Injury or had been “subsumed”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Amendment of charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For the reasons mentioned, I found that the Murder Charges could not be sustained and on 3 April 2020 invited views on the alternate charges that could be framed under s 128 of the CPC.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Murder</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The Prosecution made two alternative proposals in respect of Azlin. The first was a charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, read with s 34 for two of the four incidents. Their rationale for advancing a s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge was that Azlin should assume legal liability as a primary offender for all the four incidents, because she was solely responsible for Incidents 1 and 3, and she acted in common intention with Ridzuan for Incidents 2 and 4. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In terms of the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span>, s 299 of the Penal Code (defining “culpable homicide”, a precondition for s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code) requires that the accused “causes death by doing an act”, or, in the appropriate context, multiple acts. In the present case, given the state of the medical evidence, the Prosecution had to somehow attribute all of the acts of scalding to Azlin, as the Cumulative Scald Injury was the only provable cause of death. In proposing the alternative charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution submitted that Azlin was <span class="font-italic">legally liable</span> for Ridzuan’s acts in Incidents 2 and 4 since those acts were done in furtherance of their common intention to cause those specific scald injuries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In my view, s 34 of the Penal Code could not operate in such a way, because in the present case, both Azlin and Ridzuan were responsible for the physical components of Incidents 1 to 4, and in order for Ridzuan’s acts to be attributed to Azlin, Ridzuan and Azlin needed to share the common intention for the entire criminal act, rather than a common intention just to inflict hurt in two incidents. The language of s 34 of the Penal Code is key:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Section 34 is not a free-standing principle of attribution, but a specific rule that enables constructive liability for the offence that arises out of the “criminal act”, or “unity of criminal behaviour”. The scope of liability under s 34 of the Penal Code is restricted to the offence that arises out of the “criminal act” specified and which is commonly intended. Section 34 of the Penal Code does not enable the proof of common intention only of component offences of a “criminal act”. Hence, in this case, even if Azlin is held liable for Ridzuan’s acts under s 34 of the Penal Code for Incidents 2 and 4 because these were done in furtherance of the common intention to cause grievous hurt, this does not mean that Ridzuan’s acts can then also be attributed to Azlin for the purposes of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code. Instead, in order for Ridzuan’s acts to be attributed to Azlin for the purposes of liability under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, the common intention they needed to share would be the common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. Since this common intention could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt, this proposed charge was not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 This may also be explained by looking at <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> ([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)in its context. <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> dealt with a line of authorities on “twin crime” scenarios, where a collateral criminal act was committed in the course of the commission of the primary criminal act. Those decisions held that where the accused persons had a common intention to commit the criminal act which was the <span class="font-italic">primary</span> criminal act, then there was no need to prove a common intention as to the collateral criminal act which was done in the course of the primary criminal act: <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee </span>([110] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [253(d)]. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee</span>, the Court of Appeal upheld this position, but then added a further <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> requirement, which was that “the secondary offender must subjectively know in one in his party <span class="font-italic">may likely</span> commit the criminal act constituting the collateral offence in furtherance of the common intention of carrying out the primary offence” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee</span> at [253(d)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> departed from that stated approach in two ways. First, it reasserted the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Barendra Kumar Ghosh v </span><span class="font-italic">Emperor</span> AIR 1925 PC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Barendra</span>”)<span class="font-italic">,</span> that the necessary common intention is the “intention <span class="font-italic">to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer</span>” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [107] and [166]. Hence, in a “twin crime” scenario, for constructive liability to arise for the collateral offence, the common intention had to be directed to that <span class="font-italic">very collateral offence</span>. Secondly, it clarified that the requirement in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee</span>, being that of subjective awareness of the likelihood of the collateral offence being committed, was “only a <span class="font-italic">factor</span> in determining whether that principle of liability [under s 34 of the Penal Code] applies” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [75].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span>’s twin crime scenario carried a clear primary and secondary offender matrix where the primary offender was responsible for all the physical components of the primary crime. In the present case, the physical components that led to the Cumulative Scald Injury were the collective result of the actions of both Azlin and Ridzuan. By attributing the common intention for Incidents 2 and 4 to Azlin and then importing that common intention specific to those two incidents into the frame of the four incidents, the Prosecution was, in effect, re-introducing the <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee</span> twin crime approach in a different factual iteration. What <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> ([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) makes clear is that the unity of common intention must exist in relation to the “very criminal act” for which the offender is charged. In the case at hand, “the very criminal act” comprised four incidents, and its component parts were the actions resulting from two “doers”, acting at different points in time. There was no <span class="font-italic">single</span> actual doer for the whole criminal act: common intention was necessary before constructive liability could be imposed on each for the acts of the other. The logic of <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay </span> applied to require common intention in order to bind both these principals to the very criminal act of the offence which the four acts comprise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Grievous hurt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In the alternative, the Prosecution proposed that Azlin should face four charges under s 326 of the Penal Code for each of the four incidents, with two of them read with s 34 of the Penal Code to reflect a common intention shared with Ridzuan for Incidents 2 and 4. Ridzuan would be charged with s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code for Incidents 2 and 4. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 This was the approach taken. Azlin indicated that she would plead guilty to s 326 of the Penal Code for Incidents 1 and 3. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> was not in dispute. From Incident 1, Dr Kang opined that there were “at least partial thickness burns”,

</div> Given the Child’s young age and the subsequent deterioration of his health, it was clear the injuries from Incident 1 endangered his life. Regarding Azlin’s <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, the intention to inflict hurt which endangered life was inferred from her multiple and continuous splashing of the Child with hot water. In respect of Incident 3, the facts underpinning the charge under s 326 of the Penal Code, were clear for similar reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Incidents 2 and 4 were the subject of joint action by Azlin and Ridzuan. For Incident 2, joint participation and injuries caused were not disputed. I find that their respective acts were done in furtherance of a common intention to cause grievous hurt to the Child using the hot water, given the temperature of the water and the nature of their acts in this incident, and as they were both jointly involved in this incident and were clearly acting in agreement that this was how they wanted to discipline the Child. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In respect of Incident 4, Ridzuan was the person who inflicted the injuries but Azlin’s participation was clear as she was the one who had asked Ridzuan to deal with the situation, well knowing how he would proceed. She saw and acquiesced, in any event, in his actions.

It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind’s activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters, and the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise the will power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 While the focus may tend to be on three aspects, “the capacity to understand events, judge the rightness of wrongness of one’s actions, and exercise self-control”: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [24], see also <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> at [82], these are not exhaustive, although they are likely to be “the most relevant and oft-used tools” because they go to the heart of the issue of whether the abnormality of mind has substantially impaired an accused’s mental responsibility: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [25]. Further, while medical evidence is helpful, the opinion of an expert “is not necessarily dispositive of the <span class="font-italic">legal </span>inquiry into whether an abnormality of mind has been established under the first limb”: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [28]. The Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [29] that the medical evidence may be rejected where the factual basis upon which the medical opinion is premised is rejected at trial, and also may be rejected when viewed against the surrounding circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139  Turning to the second limb, which was a matter largely to be determined based on expert evidence” (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [22]), the Court of Appeal has emphasised that the purpose of the second limb is to restrict the scope of Exception 7: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> ([136] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> at [85].

Instead, “<span class="font-italic">the onus is still on the accused person to identify which of the prescribed causes is applicable in his case</span>.

The Prosecution gave notice that it would rely on <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] SGHC 233 (“<span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span>”) to dispute any defences without adequate factual premise. In <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span>, the accused who had pleaded guilty to various charges, asserted in mitigation that she suffered from Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) that caused her to suffer auditory hallucinations, leading her to commit the offences. The Prosecution in that case disputed the fact that she had heard voices at the time of the offences. At the ensuing Newton hearing, the Defence’s psychiatrists gave evidence, but the accused did not. The central factual dispute in that case was not whether the accused suffered from MDD (which the Prosecution did not contest), but whether the accused suffered from the auditory hallucinations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In his judgment, Menon CJ drew a key distinction between the fact of the auditory hallucination and the medical interpretation of that fact (<span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span> at [25]). Reliance on psychiatric evidence alone in that case would be inappropriate because, first, the accused’s claim to have suffered auditory hallucinations would be something “uniquely within her personal knowledge”, and so a failure to testify may warrant an adverse inference being drawn against the accused: <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span> at [26]–[27]. Second, the accused’s failure to give evidence undermined the relevance of the psychiatric evidence, which was based on facts not before the court. Menon CJ noted that the “basis rule” entailed that the “factual basis for the expert’s opinion must itself be established on admissible evidence and not on hearsay”: <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span> at [30]. In the present case, the basis rule required that the facts that form the basis of the psychiatric evidence relied upon by Azlin and Ridzuan to be before the court through admissible evidence. Psychiatric evidence is admissible under s 47 of the Evidence Act as interpretations of the facts, but the facts grounding such opinion evidence must be adduced. In considering the defences, it was therefore important to assess how their decision not to give evidence in court impacted their ability to advance their defences, and I did so, as I explain below at the relevant junctures.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Azlin</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1)  Azlin’s Adjustment Disorder</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 It was not disputed that Azlin suffered from Adjustment Disorder. In this context, the various stressors in her life were not disputed facts. These stressors, and her response, were also adequately documented in her statements admitted under s 258 of the CPC. However, her specific claim to Dr Jacob Rajesh and Dr Kenneth Koh that she had consumed methamphetamine (or “ice”) at or around the time of the offences was disputed and I should make clear that I did not take it into account.

</div> Because Ridzuan did not testify, the Prosecution took the view that there was no factual basis for Dr Ung’s diagnosis, putting the Defence to proof of the incidents of “bad temper” relied upon for the diagnosis. In an attempt to rectify the factual gap, the Defence called a witness, Ms Norhafizah binte Mega Abdul Rahman (“Ms Norhafizah”) (2DW2), Ridzuan’s sister, and also sought to have two Prosecution witnesses recalled under s 283(1) of the CPC

</div> for that purpose. I agreed to recall these two witnesses, Mdm Kamsah binte Latiff (“Mdm Kamsah”) (PW14), Ridzuan’s aunt, and Mr Nasir bin Latiff (“Mr Nasir”) (PW15), Ridzuan’s uncle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160  However, these witnesses did not give testimony on any specific incidents of violence that occurred in 2016 which Dr Ung relied upon. Ms Norhafizah categorically stated that she had no knowledge about the incidents stated at para 16 of Dr Ung’s report. Mdm Kamsah appeared to agree that those things happened, but her testimony was directed to incidents that occurred when Ridzuan was at <span class="font-italic">her</span> home, not when Ridzuan was at his own home in 2016. Mr Nasir’s evidence on the specific incidents of violence were in 2014 or 2015. Whereas he testified that he saw Azlin crying outside the flat, he did not witness the violence itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Prosecution therefore took the view that Dr Ung’s report and diagnosis of IED were not grounded on a sufficient factual basis. Moreover, they pointed out that the additional evidence Ms Norhafizah, Mdm Kamsah and Mr Nasir were technically irrelevant since Dr Ung had not considered these facts in making his diagnosis.

</div> I agreed with the Prosecution. The court was dealing with the issue of whether the expert evidence could be accepted as part of the Defence’s case that Exception 7 applied. There was, on the Defence case, a significant misalignment between the opinion evidence they sought to rely on and the factual evidence that they realised (belatedly) that they had to adduce. As seen from above, Dr Ung’s diagnosis was based on Ridzuan’s account of what had happened in 2016 (as summarised in para 16 of his report), but this evidence was unreliable hearsay as they were not found in Ridzuan’s own statements nor were they testified to by other witnesses. The other witnesses testified to various acts of violence, but Dr Ung had not considered them in his diagnosis and it is not the court’s place to now diagnose Ridzuan on the basis of new facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 At trial, Dr Ung attempted to rationalise that there were three occasions physical assault causing physical injury within a 12-month period by relying on Ridzuan’s reports that he had “used a belt, used his hands, also he had used pliers to pinch [the Child’s backside], he had punched him in the face and he had scaled him”.

In the absence of such an assessment, it would have been logically impossible for Dr Ung to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the violence was grossly <span class="font-italic">disproportionate</span> to the provocations.

</div> With respect, Dr Ung appeared to conflate the issue of premeditation and the issue of the act being committed to achieve some tangible objective, which Criterion C treats as two separate elements. If it is accepted that disciplining a child or even instilling fear is a tangible objective, on the available evidence, Ridzuan’s acts were clearly aimed at achieving a tangible objective. As Dr Cheow testified, Criterion C means that “the aggressive outburst should not be goal directed in nature”.

The offences here were grave. Sentencing serves the purpose of enforcing and maintaining the values of our community as expressed in the criminal law. It was necessary therefore that the sentences reflected the abhorrence which right-minded members of the public would have for Azlin and Ridzuan’s conduct. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 (“<span class="font-italic">Kwong Kok Hing</span>”) at [17]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Our criminal law is, in the final analysis, the public’s expression of communitarian values to be promoted, defended and preserved … A sentence must therefore appropriately encapsulate, in any given context, the proper degree of public aversion arising from the particular harmful behaviour as well as incorporate the impact of the relevant circumstances engendering each offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The specific community interest at hand is the vulnerable child, whose future is secured by protection in the present. A child is dependent upon his parents for nourishment. Yet parental authority and the parent-child relationship hold potential for abuse and severe breach of trust. A child’s home functions as a refuge where he would seek security from the dangers of the world. But if he is set upon there, its privacy precludes the intervention of the state or the kindness of strangers. The protection of the child, the lawful conduct of parents and the safety of the home are fundamental to the well-being of society and the wellspring of its aspirations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v AFR </span>[2011] 3 SLR 833 (“<span class="font-italic">AFR</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal observed at [20]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Society has a special interest in protecting the young from physical abuse, particularly by those whose duty it is to care for the young under their charge. In every case of physical abuse of a young child by a parent or caregiver, there is gross abuse of physical disparity by the offender, which manifests itself in the form of inhumane treatment of a vulnerable young victim. Public interest demands the imposition of a severe sentence in this situation: the court has to send a clear signal that offences involving physical violence against helpless children are regarded with deep abhorrence and will not be tolerated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues of mitigation and mental condition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Some, albeit limited, mitigating weight was given to Azlin and Ridzuan’s co-operation with the police. This proved to be helpful, especially for the Abuse Charges where the medical evidence was not conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Moreover, I did not give any weight to the contentions of psychiatric conditions made by both offenders. The Court of Appeal recognised in <span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 4 SLR 1287 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow</span>”) at [25] that, while the existence of a mental disorder is always a relevant factor for sentencing, its impact “depends on the circumstances of each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder”. While the need for general and specific deterrence may be given less weight if the mental disorder is serious or has a causal connection with the offence, those sentencing principles can be given <span class="font-italic">full weight</span> if the mental disorder is not serious, or there is no causal relation to the offence: <span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow</span> at [35] and [36]. The issue is whether the “mental condition is such that the offender retains substantially the mental ability or capacity to control or restrain himself”: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">BDB </span>[2018] 1 SLR 127 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”) at [72].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 For Azlin, I found that her adjustment disorder was not such as to cause substantial impairment or substantial diminishment of her mental responsibility for the offences. For Ridzuan, I found no evidence of IED, ADHD and Hypnotic Use Disorder. While the psychiatrists accepted that he was suffering from ASPD, Dr Cheow was clear that it does not affect impulse control and did not diminish his mental responsibility for the offences. Therefore, for neither accused did I find that there was any mental disorder which would diminish culpability or would prevent the need for deterrence and retribution from being given full effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Defence counsel highlighted the difficulties that Azlin and Ridzuan faced. Counsel for Ridzuan appeared to suggest that his relationship troubles with his wife and the lack of finances put him under stress.

</div> In my view, these excuses were answered by the guidance of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [75]: “the frustrations faced by a parent or caregiver due to his or her difficult personal circumstances can <span class="font-italic">never</span> justify or excuse the abuse of such victims.” The duty of a parent subsists regardless of economic and social circumstances. In any event, in this particular case, and even more inexcusably, help was available.  In particular, in the present case, [Z], and through her husband and parents, another extended family, were able and willing to look after the Child. Minimally, [Z] had asked for consent to a change of the Child’s school, because of the needs of her own children; she also offered to assume guardianship. Despite their parental duty to look to the best interests of their child, neither parent would even sign the consent form for a change of school. Therefore, their difficulties could not be used to excuse their conduct. There was a viable option for assistance and by July when the incidents of violence started, it would have become plain to both of them that they were ill-placed to care for the Child themselves. Therefore to attempt to rely on what would in any case not be an excuse, in this particular case, makes a mockery of the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suitability of life imprisonment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The Prosecution asked for life imprisonment terms: for Azlin, in respect of Incident 2; for Ridzuan, in respect of Incident 4. The justification was that “the particular crime belongs to the most serious category of cases under that offence”: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Firdaus bin Abdullah </span>[2010] 3 SLR 225 (“<span class="font-italic">Firdaus</span>”) at [17]. The Prosecution emphasized that where accused persons were parents of the victims, the maximum sentence was provided under the law for betraying the ultimate relationship of trust and authority reposed in them. Its view was that this case must be “objectively characterised as belonging to the worst end of the scale when comparing instances of that offence”, having regard to factors such as the “manner in which the death was caused, the relationship between the offender and the victim, the offender’s state of mind or the offender’s motives”: <span class="font-italic">Firdaus </span>at [17]–[18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In my view, life imprisonment is different from a maximum term of years imposed at “the worst end of the scale”. Its statutory context within the Penal Code for offences gives it special significance. For murder, life imprisonment is the mandatory minimum, the lesser of two sentencing options. For cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) allows for a sentence of life imprisonment or a term of up to 20 years where there is an intention to cause death or bodily injury that is likely to cause death. In that context, life imprisonment is the more serious of the two options. In contrast, s 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides that where there is no such intention to cause injury likely to cause death, but only knowledge that it is likely to cause death, the maximum term is ten years (this is now 15 years’ imprisonment, as of 1 January 2020). The fact that death is caused, is not, therefore determinative. This distinction between 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) informs that the mental element is of fundamental importance in the statutory provision of a life term on a discretionary basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Even in the context of s 304(a) of the Penal Code where culpability is high, the discretion is viewed with significance. Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Aniza bte Essa</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 832 (“<span class="font-italic">Aniza</span>”) expressed the view, at [45], that “the DPP must establish that this case is one that extends beyond the mere fact that the accused has committed a very serious and grave offence under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, which calls for a deterrent sentence.” Thus, for example, Chan J identified a category where “the manner in which the defendant commits the offence is so cruel and inhumane that the defendant does not deserve any leniency whatsoever”: <span class="font-italic">Aniza bte Essa</span> at [47], quoted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Barokah</span> [2009] SGHC 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Barokah</span>”) at [68]. I mention this category because it could be said that the facts, and my reasons below for the sentences imposed, reveal elements of the “cruel and inhumane”. But even <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span>, where it was not imposed, and <span class="font-italic">Barokah</span>, where it was, must be viewed in their context of s 304(a), where intent, as I mention, is minimally to cause bodily injury that is likely to cause death. A critical distinction is that s 326 of the Penal Code operates within a less culpable range of intention. <span class="font-italic">M</span><span class="font-italic">ens rea</span> is satisfied so long as the offender knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt: see s 322, Penal Code. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of grievous hurt is similarly wide: see s 320, Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The same breadth of <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> and <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> for grievous hurt is covered in s 325 of the Penal Code and therefore the punishments available for ss 326 and 325 of the Penal Code should be contrasted. Section 325 has a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment. Despite death being a form of grievous hurt under s 320(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) applicable also to s 325, a life term is permitted in only two particular iterations of grievous hurt where additional factors are present. Section 326 allows for it where dangerous weapons or means are used. Section 329 permits a life term where the object was to extort property or to facilitate the commission of another offence. Sections 325, 326 and 329 should be considered together to discern statutory purpose. Grievous hurt, by its definition, allows for a breadth of factual scenarios and different shades of requisite mental element. The width of the sentencing discretion follows from that range of factual and mental circumstances. Hence, the statutory framework informs the court that in considering a life term under s 326 of the Penal Code, two additional factors are important: the dangerous weapon or means used, and the level of intention or knowledge that the offender has in using the particular dangerous means in inflicting the particular grievous hurt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Coming then to the instant case, I start with the charge. A life term should be appropriate to the specific charge for which sentence is imposed. As compared to a case of culpable homicide where the offence is encapsulated in a single charge, the present case concerns multiple individual charges. Where multiple offences are to be considered, the fundamental duty of the court is to first ensure that <span class="font-italic">each</span> offence is addressed with an appropriate sentence: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 at [26]. It is thereafter, and only thereafter, that the overall criminality of any accused is considered in the context of the offences to arrive at a global sentence. This approach, in my view, serves to protect an offender from too broad a sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 In this context, a relevant consideration was that the life term was requested for individual episodes of Incident 2 for Azlin and Incident 4 for Ridzuan. These specific charges were framed to address “hurt which endangers life” under s 320(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) and not “death” under s 320(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) of the Penal Code. I would not, however, thereby conclude that the absence of the use of s 320(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) in the harm specified in the charge should be determinative. Section 326 itself has no such limitation, and the court ought to look to the whole of the circumstances. In this case, the charge was specified as such because the medical evidence could not pinpoint which incident caused death: it was the four incidents cumulatively that caused death. While the collective criminality of each accused’s action deserves grave sanction, to address the consequence of all four incidents in the sentence on one offence could be an excessive sentence for the particular charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 That said, I deal specifically with Incident 4 because it was asserted that the Child was likely in a dire state by that juncture. Life imprisonment was sought for Ridzuan’s actions in Incident 4 and it could have been argued therefrom that Azlin was equally culpable for Incident 4 in view of their common intention. If it had been proven that either or both had known how ill the Child was, however, s 300(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Penal Code would have been considered in the context of the amendment of the charge/s, in view of Explanation 1 to s 299 and Illustration (b) of s 300. My amending their charges to proceed under s 326 was a reflection of my findings on Azlin and Ridzuan’s states of mind. In my view, their <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, which accounted for the amendment of the charges, remained relevant here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In the present case, while death eventually ensued, the accused persons appeared at particular points not to entirely comprehend the likelihood of death resulting from their actions. Azlin expressed surprise in her statement that a child could die from scalding (“I did not think it would end up like this. I was thinking it might scald him but I did not think he would die”

</div>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 I should explain, for reasons of clarity, why Azlin’s Adjustment Disorder and Ridzuan’s low functioning mattered here where elsewhere it did not. On this specific issue, what was relevant was the mental element as proven by the Prosecution on the criminal standard of proof for the purposes of s 326 of the Penal Code. In the context of Exception 7, neither accused had proved any mental abnormality. As a matter of general mitigation, neither accused was able to show a diminution of mental responsibility for their offences of grievous hurt. Azlin’s Adjustment Disorder did not impede her ability to make choices, and Ridzuan had no intellectual disability. The points I mention form no excuse for the offences upon which they were convicted. Azlin and Ridzuan were aware of the means they employed and the dangers this posed. That was the reason they took the Child to the hospital. However, in looking at whether this is a worst case and deserving of a life term, the dangerous means and their knowledge and intent in employing that means was relevant in the statutory context. While their mental state did not impair their ability to choose the actions that they took on each of the specific charges, there was some distance in the connection between that and their knowledge as to the overall consequence of death. I did not think a life term was appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Joint culpability of Azlin and Ridzuan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I turn to their comparative culpability, relevant in dealing with their specific sentences. The Prosecution drew a distinction between Azlin and Ridzuan in their recommendations in terms of the global sentence. For Azlin, three consecutive sentences with a global sentence of 27 years’ imprisonment and an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning were suggested. For Ridzuan, the global term recommended was 24 years and 24 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In the present case, there was no clear indication that one parent was more responsible, or that more mitigating factors applied in respect of one parent. I was of the view that there should be parity between the two offenders. Both parents had joint and equal responsibility for the wellbeing of their child; both condoned each other’s appalling actions. The Prosecution recommended an overall lighter sentence for Ridzuan because Azlin initiated the second and fourth scalding incidents. I also note that she was convicted on two additional s 326 charges. Nevertheless, it was Ridzuan who introduced a culture of violence into the family and home, through his initial abuse of Azlin. It was also Ridzuan who first started the violence against the child in July, with pliers. Being the stronger partner, his use of force in each joint offence added greater injury, for example in the incident where the Child’s head hit the wall, his punch thereafter caused fractures of the nasal bone. The second and fourth scalding incidents were very serious incidents and his participation led directly to the outcome. Participation aside, the injuries sustained called for immediate medical attention, and their repeated omission to do so was the result of a joint parental decision. This neglect, which both acquiesced in, was particularly cruel as the Child would have been in great pain even from the first scalding incident. I consider that there should be parity for the offences for which they were jointly charged, and for their overall sentences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Turning then to the sentences, I first separate them into the Scalding Charges and the Abuse Charges for ease of analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Scalding Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 326 of the Penal Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Menon CJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] SGHC 247 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span>”) provides a helpful guide to sentencing under s 326 of the Penal Code by way of analogy. In that case, Menon CJ considered how to sentence an offender under s 324 of the Penal Code, holding that the approach was first to consider the appropriate sentence if the charge had been one under s 323 of the Penal Code, then to apply a suitable uplift having regard to the nature of the dangerous means used, and finally, to adjust based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances at play (<span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim </span>at [12]). Section 324 of the Penal Code stands in relation to s 323 of the Penal Code in the same way that s 326 stands in relation to s 325. In this case, therefore, I first considered the appropriate sentence under s 325 of the Penal Code, then applied a suitable uplift to account for the dangerous means used, and then adjusted the sentence on the basis of the aggravating and mitigating factors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate sentences under s 325 of the Penal Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 By analogy with <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span>, the first step is to consider the appropriate sentence under s 325 of the Penal Code as an indicative starting point. For this step, I considered the Court of Appeal’s approach to that provision in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> ([181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [55]. The Court of Appeal held that the court should first consider the seriousness of the injury and to arrive at an indicative starting sentence and then apply adjustments for culpability and aggravating and/or mitigating factors. Since the aggravating and mitigating factors will be considered in the third step by analogy with <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span>, I deal only with the issue of the seriousness of the injury in the first step. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> did not set out a range of indicative starting points, but noted that where the grievous hurt is death (under s 320(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) of the Penal Code), the starting point would be around eight years’ imprisonment, and where there are multiple fractures of the nature found in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, multiple fractures to the left elbow, left calf and left 8th to 11th ribs), the starting point would be around three years’ and six months’ imprisonment: <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [56]. As for caning, where death is the grievous hurt in question, 12 or more strokes may be warranted, while six to 12 strokes may be appropriate for non-fatal serious injuries: <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [76].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The starting point under <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> is to consider the seriousness of the injury. Death calls for a starting sentence of around eight years’ imprisonment, and in my view, this sets a ceiling on the appropriate starting sentence when considering “hurt which endangers life” under s 320(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Penal Code which is less serious than death (although perhaps in certain cases, only by a small margin). The starting point of around three years’ and six months’ imprisonment for the fractures found in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> would set the floor. The injuries in this case, given their severity and the pain caused to the Child, would lie between those two starting points. After considering the indicative sentence, I also considered the culpability of the accused persons in relation to each incident and adjusted the sentences accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 The Prosecution submitted that the starting sentences for Incident 1 ought to be three and half years’ imprisonment, for Incident 2, between eight and ten years’ imprisonment, for Incident 3, five years’ imprisonment, and for Incident 4, eight to ten years’ imprisonment. Counsel for Azlin did not provide submissions on this step of the framework. Counsel for Ridzuan argued that the starting point for the sentences should be only slightly higher than three years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six to 12 strokes of the cane.

Incident 1 was the first scalding incident. It was life-threatening but appeared less serious than the later incidents.

</div> These injuries would also have made the Child more susceptible to a variety of ailments, including hypothermia, dehydration, and infection, and all three of these were present on the Child’s arrival at hospital. Both Azlin and Ridzuan participated and both contributed to the injuries. A starting sentence of around eight years’ imprisonment was appropriate for both Azlin and Ridzuan. 12 strokes of the cane would be appropriate for this incident, given the severity of the violence involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 In Incident 3 Azlin acted alone. The injuries could not be specified with certainty, but it was sufficiently clear that the scalding would have caused further injuries and aggravated existing injuries. While the incident was shorter than the second incident and extent of injuries not as discernible, the Child was already unwell. The repetition of violence in this context is important. The same starting sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane would be applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 Incident 4 led directly to the Child’s collapse. Ridzuan attacked him with a broom and then hot water. Although it was Ridzuan who physically abused the Child in this instance, their common intention was plain. Azlin was the one who called his attention to the task. She was aware of what he would do and did do. The attack was vicious and brutal when the Child was so ill that he was unresponsive. A starting sentence of nine years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adjustment for the use of dangerous means</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Regarding the uplift to be applied to account for the dangerous means used, Menon CJ expressly considered that the potential harm that could result from the means used should be accounted for in the uplift: <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([196] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [12]. In that case, Menon CJ had occasion to consider the appropriate uplift for the use of a “lighter, coupled with a flammable aerosol” (<span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span> at [15]), and noted that (1) this was not on the “high end of serious culpability”, (2) it would have caused alarm to others, (3) it had the potential for greater harm if the surroundings had caught on fire, and (4) the offence took place at a busy road intersection and could have given rise to public alarm: <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span> at [16]. An uplift of six months’ imprisonment was imposed. It can be seen, therefore, that the analysis of the appropriate uplift is fact-centric and pays close attention to the nature of the means used <span class="font-italic">in the context</span> of the specific offence, with due regard to the potential harm as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 I begin by noting that in applying <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span> by analogy, the potential uplift between s 323 and s 324, on the one hand, and between s 325 and s 326, on the other hand, is generally the same, subject to one key difference. In terms of imprisonment, the difference between the maximum punishments for s 324 and s 323 is five years’ imprisonment (the difference between seven and two), which is the same difference between the maximum punishments for s 325 and s 326 (the difference between 15 and ten). However, s 326 differs in that there is the possibility of imposing a life sentence for the most serious range of cases. In this case, as I have declined to impose the sentence of life imprisonment, the maximum difference between s 325 and s 326 would be five years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 In my judgment, an appropriate uplift was two years’ imprisonment in this case. First, the water used in this case was all above 70℃ in temperature (see [69] above), and it was not disputed that substances with temperatures above 70℃ would cause mid to deep dermal burns,

Second, water is difficult to control and would be more dangerous given that it could lead to greater surface areas being affected, which would, in turn, result in more serious injuries and consequences.

</div>) and which involved a not insignificant <span class="font-italic">volume</span> of water. This exceptionally cruel and painful use of a dangerous means is readily available in many households. This, in my view, made it all the more important to send a deterrent message and a clear condemnation of the use of these means in the context of discipline and against children. An uplift of two years’ imprisonment was appropriate, recognising both the maximum uplift of five years’ imprisonment (for more serious and harmful means) and the need for the court to consider the full range of sentences: <span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 4 SLR 892 at [60]. In view of the significant number of strokes of the cane indicated under s 325 of the Penal Code and there being more than one charge under s 326 of the Penal Code in this case, I did not consider it necessary to include a further uplift to the number of strokes of the cane at this stage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Aggravating and mitigating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The primary aggravating factors in this case were dealt with at [177]–[179]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 In the specific context of these charges, the joint action would also have been terrifying for the young Child. This follows from the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> ([181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [68]: “In cases where two or more offenders assault a defenceless child together, the sentence imposed on the offenders should be adjusted upwards to reflect their higher culpability.” This joint violence made it easier to inflict deeper injury, but, taking a common sense approach, would have multiplied the trauma experienced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Finally, an aggravating factor for Incident 4 was the mutual prevarication in seeking medical attention, and the jointly fabricated narrative of the kettle accident used at the hospital. Prior to going to a relative’s house with the Child to seek help, Ridzuan told Azlin to lie about the injuries and to say that the Child had accidentally pulled on the kettle’s electrical cord and had water splashed on him.

</div>
</div> In my view, this was aggravating for two reasons. First, this was an attempt to deceive the authorities and to hide the commission of the offence: <span class="font-italic">Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 5 SLR 122 at [69]. Second, in the context of reporting to the hospital, this deception would have added to the confusion surrounding the Child’s true condition. I do not mean to say that there is concrete evidence that the treatment may have gone differently if the lie had not been told, but I found it aggravating that even in trying to get help for their Child, the accused persons preferred their own interests rather than trying to assist the medical staff to get a full understanding of the Child’s condition. The fact that he had been suffering from burns for a few days (up to a week) would surely have been relevant and ought to have been disclosed. The failure to do so, in my view, should be met with an uplift in the sentences.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 As for mitigating factors, I have already identified them above at [180]–[183]. On these charges, I gave some credit for the fact that for Incidents 1, 2, and 3, Azlin chose to indicate that she would plead guilty after the charges were amended, and Ridzuan did the same for Incidents 2 and 4. But my having amended the charges would have indicated that convictions would have followed, in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Considering all of these factors, I imposed a further uplift of two years’ imprisonment for Incidents 1, 2 and 3. An uplift of three years was used for Incident 4 because of the delay in seeking medical assistance and the obfuscation practiced on arrival at the hospital. In arriving at these uplifts, I took reference from the fact that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>([181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) had imposed an uplift of <span class="font-italic">one</span> years’ imprisonment for the s 325 charge relating to the victim’s death, to account for “(a) the [accused’s] position as the mother of [the victim]; (b) the extreme youth of [the victim]; (c) the viciousness of the violence inflicted; and (d) the extended period of time over which the events on 1 August 2014 unfolded”: <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [124]. With the greater maximum sentence for s 326 of the Penal Code, it was principled to provide for a more substantial uplift in this case. Such an approach would reflect the full spectrum of sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Azlin, as a female, cannot be caned: s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC. In <span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 5 SLR 904 (“<span class="font-italic">Amin</span>”) at [59], it was recognised that the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning, as well as to maintain parity among co-offenders would be factors which warrant enhancement of the sentence. With regards to deterrence, this is especially so where the potential offenders in the same situation would know that they would be exempt from caning, and this is likely to be so for those exempt because of gender: <span class="font-italic">Amin</span> at [66]–[67]. This was so in the present case. Given the importance of retribution as a sentencing principle in such cases, I considered an enhancement to be appropriate: see also <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [127]. There was also the need to maintain parity with Ridzuan: <span class="font-italic">Amin</span> at [74]. I did not see any countervailing reason why enhancement should not be imposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 According to the guidance given in <span class="font-italic">Amin</span> at [90], where between seven to 12 strokes are avoided, an enhancement of three to six months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. For the offences where Azlin avoided eight strokes, I imposed an enhancement of three months’ imprisonment. For the offences where she would otherwise have faced 12 strokes, I imposed an enhancement of six months’ imprisonment. I noted that in the round, she would have been caned a total of 24 times, and that it would be preferable if the enhanced sentences did not then exceed the total of 24 strokes. Given my conclusions on the appropriate consecutive sentences (see [237] below), however, this did not become an issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 Accordingly, the sentences ordered for Azlin and Ridzuan were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Incident 1 (C1B2): For Azlin, eight years’ imprisonment and three months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Incident 2 (D1B2 and C1B3): For Ridzuan, 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

In these offences, Ridzuan had used a pair of pliers to pinch the Deceased’s buttocks and the back of his thighs respectively, causing bruises where the Deceased had been pinched. Ridzuan used these pliers to punish and to threaten the Child. These offences were under s 5(1) of the CYPA punishable under s 5(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which carries a maximum punishment of a $4,000 fine or imprisonment not exceeding four years, or to both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Having reviewed the authorities relating to s 5(1) of the CYPA and the legislative history behind the increased punishments introduced in 2001 for s 5(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CYPA, the Court of Appeal noted in<span class="font-italic"> BDB </span>([181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [86]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We observe that in the relevant precedents cited by the parties that involved physical violence to children or young persons, <span class="font-weight-bold">the courts invariably imposed a term of imprisonment of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">at least</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> six months for offences prosecuted under s 5 of the CYPA</span>. We also note that in general, offenders who <span class="font-italic">wilfully</span> inflict injury on a child or young person may be regarded as being more culpable than offenders who act <span class="font-italic">unreasonably</span> in doing so, and should therefore receive harsher sentences than the latter category of offenders: see <span class="font-italic">PP v Kusrini bte Caslan</span> <span class="font-italic">Arja</span> [2017] SGHC 94 at [7] … [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 This accords with the sentencing principles that apply when the court sentences for child abuse. An uncompromising stance against such offences can be represented by an approach to sentencing that takes as a benchmark a sentence of around six months’ imprisonment, even before considering the variations in the specific characteristics of the abuse in question. Regardless of <span class="font-italic">how</span> the abuse is carried out, it should be met swiftly with an uncompromising response to reflect society’s condemnation of such conduct. Given the nature of s 5(1) of the CYPA, the sentencing principles articulated above at [178] for child abuse offences are always in play when this provision is involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 The Prosecution sought sentences of six months’ imprisonment for each of these charges.

</div> I note that in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> itself, the Court of Appeal left undisturbed a sentence of six months’ imprisonment where the accused had pushed the victim and the victim had fallen and hit his head. This fact scenario was virtually indistinguishable from the that charge in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>.

</div> Given this equivocation in the Prosecution’s evidence, I concluded that there would have been a blister and a partial thickness burn, but the extent of the injury was not known. I placed this at the lower end of Band 2, giving an indicative sentence of around four weeks’ imprisonment simply based on the hurt caused. In the second step, I noted that the use of a heated spoon was serious for the pain that it would cause, and also had the potential for greater harm if it had been pressed against the Child’s hand for any longer period of time, given its nature as a heated substance. An uplift of around three months’ imprisonment would have been warranted, less than that given in <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span> because the risk to third parties and potential harm overall was lower. Third, I considered the aggravating factors in this case. Here, I noted that the Child was only five years old, that this offence was an abuse of the trust given to Ridzuan as the Child’s father, and that this was part of a continuing abusive relationship. A further uplift of around five months’ imprisonment would have been warranted. In my judgment, a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment each was therefore justified for D5 and D8. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Charge D6 was under s 5(1) of the CYPA. Ridzuan had flicked ashes from a lit cigarette onto the Child’s arm and used a hanger to hit him on the palm. Counsel for Ridzuan sought a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment, while the Prosecution sought a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment. I agreed with the Prosecution. This offence should be seen in its context of the preceding offences of bullying and intimidation. The heat from the ash, similar to a heated spoon, would have been painful and terrifying. The indiscriminate and arbitrary use of ordinary household items would increase the psychological trauma for the Child. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">C5A and D7A</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 I turn to perhaps the most egregious of the offences in this category. Azlin and Ridzuan were angry at the Child and scolding him. Azlin pushed him, and falling, he hit his head on the wall, resulting in bleeding from his head. Ridzuan then gave a “very hard punch” on the Child’s nose.

He also kicked the latter in the head, causing a temporary loss of consciousness. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment per charge.

</div> I mention this here only as an example of how submissions which demean the suffering of victims are inappropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231  For these charges, there were multiple factors at play. Physical injury was caused to the Child (see [49] above). These followed upon earlier injuries, which increased his suffering: because of the earlier scalding which denuded his skin, when he was inside the cat cage, he complained of being cold. The cat cage itself was not large enough for him to stand upright or lie stretched out, except diagonally. He was locked into the cage and let out to be fed. This would have been a terrible experience for the Child, both physically uncomfortable and injurious as well as degrading. He was in the cage for approximately 11 hours in total. In my judgment, this act of abuse called for significant sentence. While the hurt was not as significant as in C5A/D7A, s 5(1) of the CYPA was broader than a hurt offence like s 323 of the Penal Code and, in my view, the nature of the ill-treatment could encompass the various factors above beyond physical injury. I sentenced Azlin and Ridzuan to one year’s imprisonment for their respective charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The aggregate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 Having determined the appropriate sentence for each offence, the next consideration is how the individual sentences should run together. As Menon CJ summarised in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span> <span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan</span> [2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>”) at [98(b)]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, the starting point of the analysis is whether the offences are unrelated and this is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest … <span class="font-italic">As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively</span>, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC. If there is a mix of related and unrelated offences, the sentences for those offences that are unrelated should generally run consecutively with one of the sentences for the related offences … This general rule may be departed from so long as the sentencing court applies its mind to consider whether this is appropriate and explains its reasons for doing so. Statutory provisions may also abridge the operation of the general rule … [citations omitted; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 In the present case, each of the charges is for a distinct act of abuse. As noted by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor</span> [2017] 3 SLR 201 at [66], the court may consider such factors as “proximity in time, proximity of purpose, proximity of location of the offences, continuity of design and unity (or diversity of the protected interests)”, but ultimately, the determination is “one of common sense”. The distinct and episodic nature of the separate acts, in the context of their proximity, should be adequately reflected in how the offences are characterised. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unrelated precedents relating to death from abuse</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Before I come to the overall sentence imposed in this case, I first distinguish various precedents cited where lower sentences were imposed for death to children. A few concerned s 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code where the prevailing statutory maximum was at the time ten years’ imprisonment (although it has been increased to 15 years’ imprisonment since 1 January 2020): <span class="font-italic">AFR</span> ([179] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>); <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ismail bin Abdullah @ Nai Henry </span>HC/CC 37/1994; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Devadass s/o Suppaiyah</span> HC/CC 41/1997. Counsel for Ridzuan cited the global sentences in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> ([181181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Firdaus</span> ([184] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), which were 14 years’ and six months’ imprisonment and 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane respectively, to argue that the sentence should not be significantly greater than either of these global sentences. <span class="font-italic">Firdaus</span> may be distinguished on the basis that s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) had a maximum imprisonment term of seven years. It was therefore not a helpful authority. <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> also concerned a s 325 of the Penal Code involving death, for which charge a sentence of nine years’ and six months’ imprisonment was imposed: <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [128], while the present case concerned multiple offences under s 326 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 In my view, a direct comparison with these cases was not helpful. First, different provisions were used, with different statutory maximum sentences. The number and severity of charges were also wholly different. These were far more severe for the case at hand. Secondly, sentencing is highly fact-specific, and the factual context in those cases were wholly different from the one at hand. While each may have resulted in death eventually, that fact alone was part of a wider factual matrix. Thus, for culpable homicide, for example, the Court of Appeal cautioned in <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic">im Ghim Peow </span>([181] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [55] that “comparisons with the sentences imposed in individual cases are of limited utility, given the wide variety of circumstances in which offences of culpable homicide are committed” and referred to the observation of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Tan Kei Loon Allan</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 679 at [33] that sentencing for culpable homicide should, for the same reason, remain a matter within the trial judge’s discretion and be left to be determined on the facts of each particular case. This rationale applies with greater force to s 326 of the Penal Code which has a even wider range of circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The consecutive sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> ([188] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Menon CJ stated at [81(j)] that in exceptional cases, a particular public interest may make it appropriate to impose more than two sentences consecutively. The particular public interest relevant in the present case has been detailed at [178]. The Prosecution submitted that this was appropriate for Azlin. I was of the view that it was also additionally appropriate for Ridzuan. The abuse lasted some four months, was repeated and escalated with each incident. In particular, after the second scalding incident, it was wholly inexcusable that the parents did not secure urgent and immediate medical attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 In my view, justice was best served by running consecutively the following three sentences for these offences committed jointly by Azlin and Ridzuan, which I set out here in their chronological order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For the second scalding incident (charges C1B3 and D1B2 respectively): 12 years imprisonment for each accused. For Ridzuan, 12 strokes of the cane. For Azlin, six months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) For the cat cage incident (charges C6 and D9 respectively), which I consider extremely cruel, given the size of the cage, the exposed wiring and the size of the child: one year’s imprisonment for each accused.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) For the fourth scalding incident (charges C1B1 and D1B1 respectively): 14 years’ imprisonment for each accused. For Ridzuan, 12 strokes of the cane. For Azlin, six months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 The total sentence for Azlin was therefore 27 years’ imprisonment and an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. This was the total sentence that the Prosecution advanced for Azlin in the event that I disagreed with a life term. For Ridzuan, the total term of imprisonment was 27 years, and 24 strokes of the cane were ordered. In terms of parity, this was the equivalent sentence for Ridzuan.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 In so deciding, I was of the view that the total sentence was not disproportionate to the culpability of Azlin or Ridzuan, as cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [25]. I was also mindful of the totality principle enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>, that the aggregate sentence must not be crushing or out of step with the offender’s past record and future prospects (see <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [54] and [57]). Both offenders were 28 years of age at time of sentencing. I was of the view that the aggregate sentence was proportionate to the offenders’ overall criminality, and not crushing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The concurrent sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 The terms of imprisonment for the remaining sentences were ordered to run concurrently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 In the result, I sentenced Ridzuan to a total term of 27 years’ imprisonment, and 24 strokes of the cane. Azlin was sentenced to a term of 27 years’ imprisonment, and an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 For Azlin, the specific sentences for which terms of imprisonment were to run consecutively were therefore as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) C1B3 (Incident 2): 12 years’ imprisonment and six months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) C6: one year’s imprisonment; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) C1B1 (Incident 4): 14 years’ imprisonment and six months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 Terms of the imprisonment for the following offences were ordered to run concurrently with the above:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) C1B2: eight years’ imprisonment and three months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) C1B4: 12 years’ imprisonment, and six months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) C2: six months’ imprisonment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) C3: six months’ imprisonment; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) C5A: one year’s imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 For Ridzuan, the specific sentences for which terms of imprisonment were to run consecutively were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) D1B2 (Incident 2): 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) D9: one year’s imprisonment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) D1B1 (Incident 4):  14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Terms of the imprisonment for the following offences were ordered to run concurrently with the above:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) D2: six months’ imprisonment;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) D3: six months’ imprisonment;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) D5: nine months’ imprisonment; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) D6: nine months’ imprisonment; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) D7A: one year’s imprisonment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) D8: nine months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Ridzuan’s term of imprisonment was backdated to the date of his remand, being 24 October 2016.
