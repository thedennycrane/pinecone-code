The remaining three charges against Mr Tanabalan are outside the scope of the O 52 r 2(2) statement against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Despite this, I have proceeded to hear and determine all seven charges against each respondent. The respondents have not appealed against my decision to do so. But O 52 r 5(3) prohibits the plaintiff from relying on any ground for committal which is not set out in the O 52 r 2(2) statement. And I accept that it is ordinarily unfair to a respondent to deal with the merits of an allegation of contempt which falls outside the scope of the O 52 r 2(2) statement on which leave was secured to apply for his committal. I therefore consider that I ought to explain why I heard and determined the combined fourteen charges of contempt against both respondents even though seven out of the fourteen charges fell outside the scope of the three O 52 r 2(2) statements against the respondents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>”), an O 52 r 2(2) statement is similar in purpose to a criminal charge. It is a procedural safeguard adopted to ensure that a person accused of contempt of court knows the case that the applicant makes against him. The O 52 r 2(2) statement therefore circumscribes the “boundaries of the applicant’s case, such as to prevent the applicant from relying on grounds that have been omitted from the statement”: <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span> at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the following three reasons, I have exercised my discretion under O 52 r 5(3) to permit the plaintiff to proceed on all fourteen charges against both respondents even though half of those fourteen charges do not arise from the three O 52 r  2(2) statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, in the circumstances of these committal applications, I consider that none of the charges which fall outside the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement will take either respondent by surprise to the extent that the plaintiff has set out the case which it advances against each respondent on all seven charges in its written submissions in the committal applications. I have put the respondents on notice that these seven charges are being pursued against them. Each respondent has addressed the seven charges made against him or her and has presented arguments as to why he or she is not liable on any of them.

</div> Mr Tan accepted that that evidence could not be relevant on the issue of liability. I therefore addressed that specific prejudice by adjourning these applications after my decision on liability for contempt to allow the respondents an opportunity to secure and place before me their trial solicitor’s evidence as mitigation when I came to consider sentencing.

</div>
</div>
</div> On the facts of this case, and in light of my first and second reasons, I considered it to be contrary to the respondents’ interests to compel the plaintiff to pursue that course. These contempt applications have already been protracted. They have entailed a great deal of time, expense, inconvenience and anxiety for all of the parties. As between the plaintiff and the respondents, the respondents are least able to bear those burdens in connection with these applications and also in connection with any fresh applications for contempt which might be brought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It was therefore, in my view, in the interests of both the applicant and the respondents – and also overall in the interests of justice and the efficient disposal of the entirety of the plaintiff’s case in contempt against the respondents – for me to deal once and for all in these proceedings with all fourteen charges of contempt which the plaintiff advances against both respondents, even though half of them fall outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement. The only qualification is that I accept that I must nevertheless be satisfied that each respondent has been given, through the plaintiff’s written submissions in these committal applications, sufficient notice with adequate particulars of those charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In those very unusual circumstances, I do not consider that any purpose would be served by rejecting any charge against either respondent purely on the basis that it falls outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement, in the absence of any actual, demonstrable prejudice to either respondent on a specific charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 That is the limit of the indulgence which I am prepared to grant the plaintiff. In particular, to the extent that the plaintiff’s three O 52 r 2(2) statements have framed its charges against either respondent in a manner unfavourable to itself, the plaintiff will nevertheless be held to the consequences of those choices. Thus, for example, if the plaintiff has framed a charge against a respondent in a way which takes on the burden of proving an element of contempt which the law of contempt would not ordinarily require it to prove, the plaintiff will be required to prove that element. The respondents are entitled to take the plaintiff at their word and to have proceeded on the basis that if the plaintiff failed to prove any element of the charge as framed against him or her, the entire charge would fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I do not consider that the approach I have taken contradicts the very clear strictures of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>. The ultimate goal of those strictures is to ensure procedural fairness for alleged contemnors. I consider that my approach, on the facts of this case, achieves that ultimate goal. In any event, without intending in any way to attenuate those strictures, I was prepared to exercise my power to proceed of my own motion on any charges of contempt against either respondent which fall outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement. The purpose of doing so, in the unusual circumstances of this case, was to avoid the respondents from being vexed by fresh committal applications to deal with those charges on the merits. Nothing in O 52 is intended to prejudice my power to make an order of committal of my own motion if I am satisfied that it is warranted: see O 52 r 4 and also <span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon</span><span class="font-italic"> v</span> <span class="font-italic">Tahir</span> [2017] 2 SLR 342 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon</span>”) at [38].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I start by examining Mdm Mageswari’s liability on the charges against her before examining Mr Tanabalan’s liability on the charges against him.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mdm Mageswari</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The basis of liability for contempt as against Mdm Mageswari</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 A fundamental point which lies at the root of all seven of the charges against Mdm Mageswari is a factual point about her involvement in the business of the defendant. This factual point is all the more important because of the basis on which the plaintiff has decided to frame its case against Mdm Mageswari. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff was entitled to frame its case against Mdm Mageswari under O 45 r 5(1)(ii) and hold her directly liable for the defendant’s alleged contempts simply by virtue of her status as a director of the defendant. But for some reason, the plaintiff chose to eschew that basis in framing its case against her. In the first of their two O 52 r 2(2) statements, the plaintiff asserts as part of its case against Mdm Mageswari in connection with the disposal of the Transvictory and the Singatac assets that: “the conduct of [Mdm Mageswari] is intended or calculated to impede, obstruct or prejudice the administration of justice in the present matter”.

As I have set out at [49(f)] above, the ordinary rule is that any director of a company who has notice of an injunction is liable to be committed for contempt if the company breaches the injunction and the director has wilfully failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the injunction is obeyed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Nevertheless, that is how the plaintiff has framed its case against Mdm Mageswari and how Mdm Mageswari has responded to it.

</div> But that has not always been the plaintiff’s position. When complaining to the Official Assignee about Mr Tanabalan’s involvement in the defendant’s business despite his status as an undischarged bankrupt, the plaintiff took the position that Mdm Mageswari is “not involved in the business [of the defendant] at all”.

It is true that she displayed first-hand knowledge of the defendant’s administrative and financial affairs both in her affidavits and in her cross-examination. But I accept that Mr Tanabalan was responsible entirely for the business and operations of the defendant. It appears to me that the only reason Mr Tanabalan did not take on formal appointment as a director of the defendant is because, as an undischarged bankrupt since June 1998,

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> s 148 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) prohibits him from doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The plaintiff made great play of the fact that Mdm Mageswari had certain duties as a director – including a duty of care – which she cannot avoid by minimising her role in the defendant. That is undoubtedly true. But Mdm Mageswari’s duties as a director – whether under statute, in equity or at common law – are duties owed to the defendant, not to the plaintiff. And the question whether Mdm Mageswari is in contempt of court in the manner charged by the plaintiff is quite a different question from whether Mdm Mageswari breached any of the duties which she owes to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I now turn to the specific charges against Mdm Mageswari.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The first charge against Mdm Mageswari is that she intentionally affirmed an affidavit of assets in August 2012 without having any personal knowledge of the facts in that affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The gravamen of this charge cannot be that Mdm Mageswari intentionally affirmed an affidavit of assets. That is not a breach of the injunction: the defendant was obliged to affirm an affidavit of assets by paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction. It is natural that Mdm Mageswari, as the defendant’s sole director, should be the deponent of that affidavit. The gravamen of the first charge is not even that the affidavit of assets was false or misleading. That is the gravamen of the second charge against Mdm Mageswari. The gravamen of the first charge is simply that Mdm Mageswari affirmed the affidavit of assets without having personal knowledge of the truth of its contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I hold that Mdm Mageswari is not in contempt of court on this charge. Consistently with my finding about Mdm Mageswari’s involvement in the business of the defendant (see [75] above), I am prepared to assume in favour of the plaintiff that Mdm Mageswari did in fact affirm the defendant’s affidavit of assets without personal knowledge of its contents. But that act alone is not a breach of the mareva injunction and is not, in itself, a contempt of court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 First, there is nothing in the mareva injunction which requires the deponent of the affidavit of assets to affirm it from personal knowledge. There is therefore no breach of the injunction, whether by the defendant or by Mdm Mageswari as the defendant’s sole director and deponent of that affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Second, a party is permitted by O 41 r 5(2) of the Rules of Court to rely on an affidavit in interlocutory proceedings whose contents are deposed to based on information or belief. A deponent who has no personal knowledge of the contents of an affidavit which she affirms is nevertheless permitted by the rules of civil procedure to affirm that affidavit on the basis of information from sources which the deponent believes to be true so long as the affidavit is for use in interlocutory proceedings. This rule applies equally to a deponent such as Mdm Mageswari who affirms an affidavit of assets filed pursuant to a discovery order in aid of a mareva injunction. That is no less an affidavit for use in interlocutory proceedings than an affidavit filed in support of or in opposition to an interlocutory application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Third, Mdm Mageswari drew the distinction in the affidavit of assets between evidence given upon information and belief and information which she knew to be true from her own personal knowledge. Thus, she acknowledged explicitly in the affidavit of assets that she was attesting to the values of the 70 assets on information and belief, not from personal knowledge. In paragraph 3 of her affidavit, she says:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With the exception of the trade receivables and cash and bank balances, the values that I have provided for [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in this affidavit of the other assets belonging to the [defendant] are estimates made to the best of my knowledge and belief. The details of assets provided for [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in this affidavit are, to the best of my knowledge, true and accurate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Mdm Mageswari was perfectly entitled, under the applicable procedural rules, to affirm the affidavit of assets on information and belief. The only criticism which can be made of her on this score is that she failed to identify the sources of and grounds for her belief. But that is at most a procedural default, not a contempt of court. Complying with a discovery order in aid of a mareva injunction, and doing so in substance in a way which the procedural rules permit, is not a contempt of court in itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I therefore find that Mdm Mageswari is not in contempt of court on the first charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The second charge is that Mdm Mageswari misled the court and the plaintiff by intentionally providing inaccurate and inflated values for each asset listed in the affidavit of assets, despite being fully aware that the values were incorrect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I hold that Mdm Mageswari is not in contempt of court on this charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In the affidavit of assets, Mdm Mageswari listed individually 70 assets owned by the defendant. Her list set out a brief description of each asset, the number of units of the asset owned, the unit value of that asset and the total value of that set of assets. The unit values ranged from $3,000 to $550,000. The total value of the 70 assets was stated to be $3.26m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 To succeed on the second charge, the plaintiff must satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt on two points. First, that the values which Mdm Mageswari set out in the affidavit of assets are in fact inaccurate or inflated. Second, that Mdm Mageswari <span class="font-italic">misled</span> the court and the plaintiff by <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> providing those inaccurate or inflated values.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In order for the plaintiff to succeed on the first point – the inaccurate valuations – the plaintiff must establish that the values which Mdm Mageswari gave in the defendant’s affidavit of assets were inaccurate <span class="font-italic">at the time</span> she affirmed the affidavit. The reason for this is obvious. Mdm Mageswari cannot be in contempt of court if the values she gave were accurate when she affirmed her affidavit but fell subsequently, whether because of a deterioration in the condition of those assets, a deterioration in the value of those assets or a deterioration in the market for those assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Mdm Mageswari accepted in cross-examination that the valuations which she set out in the affidavit of assets were, in point of fact, inaccurate at that time:

The plaintiff’s case is that the values in the affidavit of assets must have been inaccurate at the time she affirmed the affidavit because Exaco’s valuation of a subset of those assets in 2013, just over a year after Mdm Mageswari swore the affidavit of assets, was as low as 11% of the value which Mdm Mageswari had ascribed to those same assets in the affidavit of assets in August 2012 (see [34] above).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The plaintiff also points out that the value realised at auction for what remained of the Soon Lee Street assets in 2017 was a fraction of Exaco’s valuation of those assets, which was in turn a fraction of the value which Mdm Mageswari had ascribed to those assets in the affidavit of assets in August 2012 (see [41] and [42] above). Quite apart from Mdm Mageswari’s admission in cross-examination that the values were inaccurate in point of fact as at August 2012, I accept that the plaintiff has produced strong circumstantial evidence capable of supporting a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the values ascribed to the 70 assets were inaccurate when Mdm Mageswari affirmed her affidavit in 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In order for the plaintiff to succeed on the second point – as to Mdm Mageswari’s mental element – the plaintiff must establish that Mdm Mageswari <span class="font-italic">knew</span> at the time she swore the affidavit that the values were inaccurate. That is the mental element which the plaintiff has alleged against Mdm Mageswari: that she presented the inaccurate values in order <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> to <span class="font-italic">misle</span><span class="font-italic">ad</span> the plaintiff and the court. That is a more stringent mental element than is ordinarily required for a finding of contempt. Ordinarily, a party or someone acting at the direction of or on behalf of a party is liable to be committed for contempt so long as she does an act which is ultimately a breach of the injunction, even if she did not intend to breach the injunction or to prejudice the administration of justice by that act (see [49(d)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The upshot on the second charge is that the plaintiff has chosen to allege a mental element on the second charge which is more stringent than the case law requires. It has thereby taken on the burden of proving that more stringent mental element. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I consider it entirely fair to hold the plaintiff to this more stringent element, given that it has selected it for itself by choosing to frame its charge in this way. Further, not to hold the plaintiff to this standard would be quite unfair to Mdm Mageswari. She was perfectly entitled to think that her defence on this charge would succeed if she could prove that she did not seek <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> to <span class="font-italic">mislead</span> either the plaintiff or the court by providing inaccurate values for the 70 assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The evidence before me establishes that Mr Tanabalan is the person who has at all times had personal knowledge of the defendant’s assets and their value. I have accepted Mdm Mageswari’s evidence that she was not involved in the technical or operations side of the defendant’s business and that that fell solely within Mr Tanabalan’s purview. Mdm Mageswari obtained the information on these 70 assets and their values from Mr Tanabalan for the purposes of the affidavit of assets. The plaintiff has no evidence – only mere supposition and speculation – that Mdm Mageswari relayed that information to the plaintiff and to the court either: (i) knowing that the information was false; or (ii) not believing the information to be true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff appears to suggest that it will have established the mental element it has alleged on this charge if it establishes that Mdm Mageswari failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the true condition and value of each asset before filing the affidavit of assets.

</div>
</div> That is not correct on both counts. Negligently misstating the value of the assets is not the mental element which the plaintiff has chosen to charge against Mdm Mageswari. And it is not enough for the plaintiff to establish the mental element which it <span class="font-italic">has</span> chosen charge against Mdm Mageswari merely on the balance of probabilities.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The plaintiff also tries to argue that Mdm Mageswari is in contempt of court on the second charge by reason of her failure, in the defendant’s March 2014 letter, to correct the values which she had ascribed to the defendant’s assets in the August 2012affidavit of assets. The plaintiff points out that, at the time Mdm Mageswari wrote the March 2014 letter, she was aware that the plaintiff had cast doubt on the values listed in the affidavit of assets and that Exaco had valued a subset of those assets in October 2013 at 11% of the values she had ascribed to that subset.

Mdm Mageswari says that, in March 2014, the defendant had set aside assets which were worth $1.5m and which did not include the SCB SGD account. Accordingly, she withdrew this money from the SCB SGD account believing that the mareva injunction allowed her to do so.

</div> Mdm Mageswari’s evidence is that she believed that Standard Chartered Bank had lifted the hold on the SCB SGD account because the defendant had already set aside assets valued at $1.5m as required by the mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Given that I have found that the values ascribed to the defendant’s assets in the affidavit of assets were inaccurate, I am satisfied that at the time Mdm Mageswari withdrew this money, the total value of the defendant’s assets in Singapore was less than S$1.5m. I do not accept her explanation that she is not in contempt of court because she believed that the bank had lifted the hold on the SCB SGD account. A letter from Standard Chartered Bank dated 18 November 2016 confirms that the bank lifted the hold only because Mdm Mageswari had instructed the bank to close the account.

</div> That is no excuse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction plainly states that the defendant must inform the plaintiff “in writing at once of all [its] assets whether in Singapore whether in [its] own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned, giving the value, location and details of all such assets”. The defendant was obliged to disclose both of these bank accounts by that paragraph. The defendant was also obliged to give the value and details of its accounts receivables. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In answering questions in cross-examination and in making submissions for herself and for Mr Tanabalan, Mdm Mageswari proved herself well able to read, speak and understand English. I do not accept that she needed legal advice to understand the disclosure obligation which paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction clearly spells out in non-legal language. Mdm Mageswari’s evidence that she did not comply with paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction fully because the defendant’s lawyers failed to advise her to do so does not excuse her of contempt. It goes only towards mitigation, if anything at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I therefore find that Mdm Mageswari is in contempt of court on the fourth charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fifth charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The fifth charge against Mdm Mageswari is that she intentionally, and in order to impede the administration of justice, disposed of or dealt with the five Transvictory assets and the 20 Singatac assets (see [24] above) by knowingly storing these assets “with the defendant’s creditors” and later by failing and refusing to pay the rental charges due to Singatac and by failing and refusing to pay the debt owed to Mr Richard of Transvictory. These 25 assets were valued in the affidavit of assets at $1.275m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I hold that Mdm Mageswari is not in contempt of court on the fifth charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The subject-matter of the fifth charge against Mdm Mageswari are the five Transvictory assets and the 20 Singatac assets. No other assets are the subject-matter of the fifth charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The plaintiff attempts to justify its case against Mdm Mageswari on the fifth charge by pointing to the defendant’s disposal after March 2014 of the assets which were listed in the affidavit of assets in August 2012 but which were not listed in the defendant’s March 2014 letter. The defendant disposed of these unlisted assets because it considered itself free to deal with them under paragraph 1(c) and 4 of the mareva injunction on the basis that the March 2014 letter had identified assets worth $1.5m.

</div> That too is not the subject-matter of the fifth charge against Mdm Mageswari. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The plaintiff’s submissions on the fifth charge appear to be that Mdm Mageswari is in contempt simply because: (a) the defendant is in breach of the mareva injunction; and (b) Mdm Mageswari is a director of the defendant. That is not the case which the plaintiff advanced against Mdm Mageswari in the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement. The case against Mdm Mageswari asserted there is that she is in contempt of court because: (a) storing the Transvictory assets with Transvictory and the Singatac assets with Singatac is a breach of the mareva injunction by the defendant; (b) Mdm Mageswari personally caused the defendant to be in breach of the injunction in that way; and (c) Mdm Mageswari therby intended to impede the administration of justice. Given my findings as to Mdm Mageswari’s involvement in the business and operations of the defendant, I am satisfied that Mdm Mageswari did not personally cause the defendant to store these 25 assets at the Transvictory and Singatac premises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In any event, I am also not satisfied that the defendant breached the mareva injunction in relation to the subject-matter of the fifth charge. I analyse this in greater detail when considering Mr Tanabalan’s liability on the similar charges presented against him (see [174] to [197] below). In brief, I do not consider that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of proving that the sale of these 25 assets by Transvictory and Singatac in the circumstances which the plaintiff posits to be the case for each set of assets amounts to a disposal by the defendant within the meaning of paragraph 1(a) of the mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I therefore find that Mdm Mageswari is not in contempt of court on the fifth charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sixth charge</span>

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Plaintiffs humbly submit that by deliberately moving these 5 assets to another location, and subsequently refusing to inform the Plaintiffs of the location and/or address of the said assets albeit being directed to do so by the Court on numerous occasions, [Mdm] Mageswari is clearly in contempt of Court for dealing with and/or diminishing the value of the assets, and potentially disposing of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 This charge therefore has two limbs: deliberately moving the five assets subsequently refusing to inform the plaintiff of their location. It is critical that, on the first limb, the plaintiff does not allege that the defendant has disposed of these five assets: the highest it puts its case is that the defendant has “potentially” disposed of these assets. I do not consider that the defendant is in contempt of court on either limb. Mdm Mageswari’s liability for contempt as the sole director of the defendant therefore does not even arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On the first limb, simply moving the Soon Lee Street assets is not a dealing with the assets. There is nothing in the mareva injunction which forbids the defendant from moving its assets. I do not consider moving assets to be a dealing with the assets.  Simply moving assets does not interfere with the defendant’s right to and interest in the economic value of the asset, which is what the mareva is designed to preserve. I also do not accept that the plaintiff has established beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mdm Mageswari herself who “deliberately” moved these assets, as the plaintiff has alleged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 On the second limb, the plaintiff must establish a breach by the defendant of the disclosure obligation in the mareva for which Mdm Mageswari can be held responsible in contempt. If all that the plaintiff can show is that Mdm Mageswari is personally in breach of a court order made in the examination of judgment debtor proceedings, that is for the plaintiff to pursue separately. A failure of that sort is not the subject-matter of either of the two committal applications which Mdm Mageswari now faces.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The only way for the plaintiff to succeed on the second limb of the sixth charge, therefore, is to show that the defendant’s failure to disclose the location of the Soon Lee Street assets is a breach of the defendant’s mandatory disclosure obligation under the mareva injunction for which Mdm Mageswari can be held to be in contempt. The only provision of the mareva injunction which is mandatory and which requires the defendant to disclose the location of its assets is paragraph 2. The plaintiff’s case appears to be that paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction imposes a continuing obligation on the defendant to update the plaintiff as to the location of its assets from time to time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I reject the plaintiff’s case. I consider paragraph 2 to impose a one-off disclosure obligation and not a continuing one. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 First, paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction is in terms a one-off disclosure obligation. It requires the defendant to disclose its assets at once and to verify that disclosure by affidavit within 21 days of service. It says nothing about further disclosures. Nothing in paragraph 2 – or indeed elsewhere in the mareva injunction – obliges the defendant to file further affidavits of assets from time to time to bring the facts set out in it up to date as they change. In my view, once the defendant filed its affidavit of assets in August 2012, the defendant’s obligation under paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction was discharged and the coercive effect of that paragraph was spent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The second reason I say that paragraph 2 imposes a one-off obligation and not a continuing obligation is that the mareva injunction makes express provision for periodicity when it imposes a continuing obligation. Thus, paragraph 4 of the injunction requires the defendant to “account to the [p]laintiffs monthly” for asset disposals in the ordinary course of business. There is no similar specification of periodicity in paragraph 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Finally, the plaintiff itself read paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction as imposing a one-off obligation. In two letters from the plaintiff’s solicitors to the defendant’s trial solicitors in September 2013,

</div> the plaintiff’s solicitors asked the defendant to give “an accurate and updated account of [its] assets” and asked the defendant to do so voluntarily in order to obviate a further application to the court. The plaintiff’s solicitors did not take the position that this update by affidavit was an existing obligation of the defendant under paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction. That is why the plaintiff’s solicitors expressly gave notice of an intention to apply for a <span class="font-italic">further</span> order to compel the disclosure. If paragraph 2 imposed a continuing obligation on the defendant to disclose its assets, the plaintiff would not have written this letter, or at least not in these terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 A one-off disclosure obligation is consistent both with the purpose of a mareva injunction and also with the purpose of discovery in aid of a mareva injunction. The effect of a mareva injunction is to impose a personal obligation on a defendant prohibiting it from dealing with or disposing of its assets up to a certain value until the plaintiff’s claim has been determined. The purpose of the prohibition is to avoid any judgment which the plaintiff might obtain being rendered nugatory. It is not the purpose of a mareva injunction to require the defendant to account to the plaintiff for all movements in its assets, where those movements fall short of a prohibited dealing or disposal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Further, the purpose of disclosure in aid of a mareva injunction is to compel the defendant to let the plaintiff to know “at once”: (i) what the defendant’s assets are and their value; and (ii) where the defendant’s assets can be found. With that information in hand, the plaintiff can take an informed decision soon after the injunction is granted whether it needs to take any further steps for additional protection against the defendant dealing with or disposing of its assets contrary to the mareva injunction. These further steps include putting third parties on notice of the terms of the injunction and, most importantly in the present context, further applications to court for additional disclosure or prohibitions. It is for the plaintiff to apply to court and to make out a case for the further orders necessary to put in place the further protection. In short, if a plaintiff wants a defendant to have a continuing obligation to disclose changes in the physical location of assets, it is for the plaintiff to ask the court to order the defendant to provide that disclosure upon showing a justification for it. A mareva injunction in the form granted in this case does not, in itself, contain or imply any such continuing obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 A defendant may keep a plaintiff updated as to any changes in the physical location of its assets even if those changes do not amount to a prohibited dealing with or disposal of its assets. Indeed, the defendant did so in this case in March 2014. But a defendant who does so volunteers to do so and does not do so pursuant to any obligation under the injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I therefore find that there is no breach of the mareva injunction on the sixth charge. The fact is that the defendant moved the Soon Lee Street assets. However, it is not part of the plaintiff’s case on this charge that the defendant dealt with or disposed of the assets in a manner prohibited by the mareva injunction. It appears that the defendant had to move these assets as they posed a safety hazard.

But that too goes only to mitigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I therefore find Mdm Mageswari is in contempt of court on the seventh charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Tanabalan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I turn now to the seven charges of contempt against Mr Tanabalan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The basis of liability for contempt as against Mr Tanabalan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 As in the case of Mdm Mageswari, the plaintiff is entitled to hold Mr Tanabalan directly liable for the defendant’s contempts under O 45 r 5(1)(ii). There are two grounds on which the plaintiff can do that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The first ground is on the basis that Mr Tanabalan is a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions Mdm Mageswari – as the only formally-appointed director of the defendant – was and is accustomed to act. This is borne out by Mdm Mageswari’s evidence. She testified that she relied entirely on Mr Tanabalan to take care of the commercial aspects of the defendant’s business while she handled only the administrative aspects.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affidavit of SM dated 26 July 2016 at paragraphs 7 and 8.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On that basis, plaintiff could have argued that Mr Tanabalan was a “director” of the company within the extended definition of a “director” in s 4 of the Companies Act even though he was not formally appointed a director (and indeed could not have been, being an undischarged bankrupt). A person within the extended definition of “director” is what is commonly called a “shadow director”. That would have sufficed to bring Mr Tanabalan within the meaning of “director” in O 45 r 5(1)(ii). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The second ground in which the plaintiff is entitled to hold Mr Tanabalan directly responsible for the defendant’s alleged contempt of court is simply by virtue of his status as the general manager of the defendant. Order 45 r 5(1)(ii) allows an order of committal to issue against “a director or other officer” of a body corporate which has breached an injunction. Section 4 of the Companies Act defines an “officer” of a corporation as including “a person employed in an executive capacity by the corporation”. Mr Tanabalan, on his own evidence, held an executive position in the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Again, for some reason, the plaintiff has chosen to make its case more difficult for itself than it has to be. In the O 52 r 2(2) statement against Mr Tanabalan, the plaintiff asserts that it is proceeding against Mr Tanabalan as a person who has “knowingly assisted in and/or permitted a breach of the [m]areva [i]njunction”.

</div>
</div>
</div> That echoes the words of paragraph 8 of the injunction dealing with the liability of a third party for contempt of court (see [11(h)] above). The plaintiff’s classification of Mr Tanabalan as a third party, and not as being directly responsible for the defendant’s acts, has important consequences for the mental element which the plaintiff must prove against Mr Tanabalan. I deal with this in more detail at [150] below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The mental element as against Mr Tanabalan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The plaintiff’s decision to frame its case against Mr Tanabalan as third-party liability under paragraph 8 of the mareva injunction has important implications for the mental element which the plaintiff must prove as against Mr Tanabalan. Against a respondent who is directly answerable under O 45 r 5(1)(ii) for a corporation’s contempt, a plaintiff ordinarily needs only to show an intent to do an act which is in fact a breach of the injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 However, in order to succeed in establishing contempt against a respondent who is a third party, such as (on the plaintiff’s case) Mr Tanabalan, the plaintiff must show “<span class="font-italic">a specific intent</span> on the part of the third party … to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice” (see <span class="font-italic">Pertamina Energy </span>at [63]).

</div>
</div> that, in order to establish that Mr Tanabalan in contempt, it must satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tanabalan had a specific intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I pause to make an additional point. It is clear from both respondents’ evidence that Mr Tanabalan has, throughout the period that the defendant was subject to the mareva injunction, been in breach of both limbs of s 148 of the Companies Act. That provision prohibits an undischarged bankrupt from “act[ing] as director of, or directly or indirectly tak[ing] part in or [being] concerned in the management of, any corporation, except with the leave of the Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee”. That said, a breach of s 148 is neither a subject of any of the charges of contempt which are before me nor relevant to Mr Tanabalan’s liability for contempt on any of the charges which are before me. I therefore say no more on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I turn now to address each of the charges against Mr Tanalaban. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The first charge against Mr Tanabalan is that he deliberately assisted Mdm Mageswari in preparing the affidavit of assets and provided inaccurate and misleading values for the assets listed in the affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I hold that Mr Tanabalan is not in contempt of court on the first charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 It is correct that Mr Tanabalan provided the information to Mdm Mageswari which formed the content of the affidavit of assets which she then affirmed for the defendant. But the first charge against Mr Tanabalan is based on inaccurate information alone and does not involve any alleged dealing with or disposal of the defendant's assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As in the case of the second charge against Mdm Mageswari, the plaintiff has taken on the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tanabalan deliberately – <span class="font-italic">ie</span> with knowledge that the values of the assets were misleading and inaccurate – gave Mdm Mageswari the misleading and inaccurate values and that he intended to prejudice the due administration of justice by doing so. The plaintiff has not satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that either was the case in August 2012. The fact that the assets were valued in 2013 at a fraction of the value ascribed to them by Mr Tanabalan and that some of them fetched even lower values when auctioned in 2017 suffices for a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the values were in fact inaccurate. However, that does not suffice for a finding beyond reasonable doubt as to Mr Tanabalan’s mental element in August 2012.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The second charge against Mr Tanabalan is that he intentionally dissipated the monies in the defendant’s bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I hold that Mr Tanabalan is not in contempt of court on the second charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The charge against Mr Tanabalan is not fleshed out or particularised anywhere in the plaintiff’s closing submissions. In the circumstances, I do not think it appropriate to find Mr Tanabalan liable for contempt on a charge which is so lacking in particulars. The lack of particulars is such as to deprive Mr Tanabalan of a reasonable opportunity to know the case against him and to respond to it effectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In any event, I have accepted on the facts that it was Mdm Mageswari, and not Mr Tanabalan, who was responsible for the administrative aspects of the defendant.

</div> and the values realised at auction for some of those assets in 2017. It is, of course, true that the auction was a forced sale. It is also true that the lapse of time between the date on which these 36 assets were valued at $1.5m and the date on which these assets were force-sold may have resulted either in a deterioration in the condition of the assets or a deterioration in the market for the assets or both. All of this may have resulted in the realised values being much lower than the declared values. But Mr Tanabalan, as the party with the burden on this issue, has produced no evidence of any such deterioration. And the difference between the values is so vast as to suggest strongly that the 36 assets which Mr Tanabalan set aside did not amount in value to $1.5m when he set them aside.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Despite this, I do not accept that Mr Tanabalan is in contempt of court on the fourth charge. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 First, the mareva injunction is a personal injunction directed at a defendant prohibiting it from dealing with its own assets up to a certain value until the plaintiff’s claim is adjudicated. A mareva injunction circumscribes a defendant’s conduct in relation to its own assets only to the extent prohibited by the injunction. A mareva injunction is, of course, susceptible to a purposive interpretation. But a purposive interpretation can only go so far, particularly when committal to prison for contempt is the potential consequence of a breach. Certainly, a purposive interpretation cannot go so far as to change the core prohibitory obligation of a mareva injunction or the fundamental nature of the core obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The fourth charge which the plaintiff asserts against Mr Tanabalan posits that a mareva injunction imposes by implication on a <span class="font-italic">third party</span> a <span class="font-italic">mandatory</span> obligation – on penalty of committal for contempt and possibly being imprisoned – to take positive steps to allocate the third party’s own resources to preserve the defendant's assets until the plaintiff secures its judgment. It is going very far indeed to imply a mandatory provision of that sort into what is essentially a prohibitory injunction. It is going even further to make that binding on a third party in the position of Mr Tanabalan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Second, the position argued for by the plaintiff seems to me to amount to the court ordering the defendant to bestow on the plaintiff an added positive “benefit” – over and above the defendant’s negative obligation not to deal with or dispose of its assets – so that the defendant keeps itself in a position to meet a possible future judgment in a plaintiff’s favour. Where the defendant’s most valuable assets are, as here, large and bulky, storage costs for those assets can be substantial. And interpreting a mareva injunction, in itself, as requiring the defendant to bear those costs for the plaintiff’s ultimate benefit would go far too far. That is especially so considering that 12 to 18 months can elapse between the grant of a mareva injunction pre-trial and the plaintiff securing a judgment at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Third, I accept that the defendant lacked the financial resources to pay the rent for the Singatac assets. Mr Tanabalan has deposed that the defendant was facing severe financial difficulties in 2013.

</div> It is not part of the plaintiff’s case on either the fifth or the sixth charge that it was Mr Tanabalan who disposed of the Transvictory assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 As a result, the gravamen of these two charges is not that Mr Tanabalan disposed of the Transvictory assets directly, thereby assisting or permitting the defendant to breach the mareva injunction. Nor does the plaintiff allege that Mr Tanabalan disposed of the Transvictory assets indirectly by colluding with Transvictory to have the assets seized and sold in satisfaction of the defendant’s debt to Transvictory. Instead, the plaintiff’s case is that Mr Tanabalan breached the mareva injunction simply by knowingly storing the defendant’s assets with a creditor of the defendant such that the creditor eventually seized and sold those assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I must take the plaintiff’s case as it is presented to me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 On the case presented to me, Transvictory’s disposal of the assets stored on their premises cannot be attributed to Mr Tanabalan. The plaintiff has not proven beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tanabalan stored the defendant’s assets at Transvictory’s premises either expressly as security for the defendant’s debt to Transvictory or collusively, with an express or implied agreement that Transvictory should have recourse to the assets as <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 But even if I am wrong on that finding, the plaintiff also has not proven beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tanabalan intended to prejudice the due administration of justice by storing the assets with Transvictory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Another aspect of these two charges against Mr Tanabalan is that the plaintiff claims that the defendant’s failure to commence proceedings to recover from Transvictory the difference between the value of the Transvictory assets and the debt due from the defendant to Transvictory is evidence of collusion.

</div> According to Mr Tanabalan, the assets left with Transvictory were worth $630,000, which far exceeded the $300,000 debt which the defendant owed to Transvictory, leaving the defendant with a potential claim against Transvictory for the reaming $330,000 in value. The defendant has not taken any steps to pursue that claim against Transvictory. Mr Tanabalan’s explanation for the failure is that the defendant did not know how to go about it.

</div> The plaintiff submits that that is an abject failure to take due care of the defendant’s assets. I accept that the defendant’s failure to commence proceedings to recover damages from Transvictory can be explained on the basis that the defendant did not have the funds necessary to commence further litigation.

Further, even if I assume that Mr Tanabalan should have informed the plaintiff of the new location of the assets, the plaintiff has not shown beyond reasonable doubt how Mr Tanabalan’s failure to do so was intended to prejudice the due administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 I therefore find that Mr Tanabalan is not in contempt of court on the seventh charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Even if the gravamen of the seventh charge is that Mr Tanabalan has assisted or permitted the defendant to deal with the Soon Lee Street assets simply by moving them to a new location, the plaintiff has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he did so intending to prejudice the due administration of justice.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I have found Mdm Mageswari to be guilty of contempt of court on the third, fourth and seventh charges against her. I have found Mr Tanabalan to be guilty of contempt of court on the third charge against him. I now set out my decision on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I first examine the guidance on sentencing for civil contempt given by the Court of Appeal. In <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>, the Court of Appeal indicated that the following factors are relevant (at [104]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the claimant has been prejudiced by virtue of the contempt and whether the prejudice is capable of remedy; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the extent to which the contemnor has acted under pressure; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the breach of the order was deliberate or unintentional; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the degree of culpability;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the contemnor has been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) whether the contemnor appreciates the seriousness of the deliberate breach; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) whether the contemnor has co-operated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The law also recognises that distinctions should be drawn between breaches which are one-off in nature, and breaches which are either continuing or repeated in nature: <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span> at [103]. Where one-off breaches are concerned, the overriding sentencing principle is punishment because there is no longer any coercive value to the sentence ordered, given that the contemnor is no longer in a position to remedy the breach. In the case of continuing breaches, however, the court takes into account both punitive and coercive elements: <span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon </span>at [56]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Another important consideration to be taken into account is whether the contemnor’s non-compliance with the court order has become a matter of public concern: <span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon </span>at [57]–[58]. There is a public interest in the upholding of the court’s authority as expressed in orders of court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Finally, it is very important to recognise that committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort, to be utilised where the court is faced with a recalcitrant and obstructive litigant in continuous breach: <span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsusho (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v Foo Tseh Wan and others </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1215 (“<span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsu</span><span class="font-italic">sho</span>”) at [55]. As was the case in <span class="font-italic">Clement </span><span class="font-italic">Lee</span>, where the advantage obtained by the contemnor as a result of the breach is the ability to spend more money, a financial sanction may be sufficient (at [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 In addition to these general principles, it is also important to recognise three key authorities so far as breaches of mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunctions are concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The first authority is the case of <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 60 (“<span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>”), a decision of the High Court. That case involved multiple breaches of a mareva injunction, including failures to disclose assets and failures to attend court for cross-examination pursuant to orders and directions given. The court found that the contemnors had <span class="font-italic">deliberately</span> disobeyed the orders with no good excuse, under a single-minded objective of avoiding disclosure of their assets. There was clear defiance of the authority of the court. In the circumstances, the court ordered an imprisonment term of six months for each contemnor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The second authority is the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span>. In that case, the first defendant was found guilty of contempt of court for (a) preventing the execution of an <span class="font-italic">anton piller</span> order at two different premises; (b) withdrawing $380,000 from his bank account in breach of the mareva injunction; (c) failing to comply with disclosure requirements in the anton piller and mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunctions; and (d) failing to deliver his passport to the plaintiff in breach of ancillary orders made by the court. The court also made several other observations. The court noted that the defendant was a repeat offender, having breached a mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction in the past. The court noted that the defendant, being a bankrupt, could no longer make good his breach. And the court noted that the defendant appeared to have dragged the proceedings on for more than three years, during which time much time and money had been wasted. In the circumstances, the court sentenced the defendant to six months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Although both of these authorities were decided before the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>, they were both cited by the Court of Appeal in that case without any apparent disapproval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Finally, I note the case of <span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsusho</span>. That case involved the breach of disclosure obligations under a mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction. The contemnor persistently refused to disclose his assets and instead filed affidavits of assets and means which lacked any credibility. The High Court found that the contemnor had acted in flagrant disregard of the mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction, and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. I should note that that case was decided after the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>, and the guidance given by the Court of Appeal was taken into account in the sentence imposed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s submission on sentencing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 At this point I pause to make a point about the plaintiff’s submissions on sentencing. The plaintiff’s initial submission, made repeatedly, was that I should sentence Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan to six years’ imprisonment each.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The authorities which I have cited should have made it clear to the plaintiff and those advising it that the sentence which it has sought in its submissions – whether imprisonment for six years or for three years – is completely unsupported by any authority binding on me or even persuasive to me and is excessive on any view of the law. It appears to me that the initial submission repeatedly urging a sentence of six years’ imprisonment was put forward not to assist the court – which is the only proper purpose of any submission – but to intimidate and oppress the respondents. The fact that that submission has been moderated to three years’ imprisonment in the further submissions is equally oppressive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 I now turn to consider the sentences to be imposed on Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mdm Mageswari</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 I have found Mdm Mageswari liable on the third, fourth, and seventh charges against her. The fourth and seventh charges relate to failure to disclose assets. The third charge relates to a disposal of assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 I accept the evidence given by Mdm Mageswari that, in carrying out the acts which form the basis of the charges for which I have found her guilty, she: (a) relied on Mr Tanabalan and that it was reasonable of her to rely on him; and (b) genuinely believed that she was acting on the advice of the defendant’s solicitor, or – at the very least – that she was not acting inconsistently with his advice. By this, what I mean is that I accept that Mdm Mageswari subjectively thought that her actions were not in breach of the mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction. That is, of course, no defence to a charge of contempt. But it can be mitigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 I am conscious that Mdm Mageswari has failed to support this aspect of her mitigation by putting the defendant’s solicitor’s own evidence before me. She failed to do this even though both respondents specifically sought permission to do so and even though I granted them that permission. As a result, I have not heard from the defendant’s solicitor on the actual content of the advice which he gave to Mdm Mageswari. I am therefore in no position to judge, objectively speaking, whether the content of his advice was as Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan have testified. I make no finding on that issue. Nevertheless, having observed Mdm Mageswari giving her evidence and being cross-examined on it, I accept her evidence as to how she <span class="font-italic">understood</span> the defendant’s solicitor’s advice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 As the court in <span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon </span>noted at [53], given the gravity of an order of committal and the fact that such proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, any reasonable doubt as to motive, intention or understanding should be resolved in the contemnor’s favour. I consider that that principle applies equally when determining the appropriate penalty for contempt as it does in determining liability for contempt in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Mdm Mageswari testified in cross-examination that she believed that she was at all times acting consistently with the advice of the defendant’s solicitor. She maintained that position when she was making her submissions to me orally. She maintained that position to the extent that, as her counsel informed me in closing submissions, she was willing to waive privilege and adduce evidence from the defendant’s former solicitor at the sentencing stage. In the event, he declined to give evidence and, I was informed, the respondents lacked the means to issue a subpoena to require him to attend. So I did not hear his evidence. But, as I have said, the question before me is not what advice the defendant’s solicitor actually gave Mdm Mageswari but how she understood that advice. On that issue, I accept her oral evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I therefore find that Mdm Mageswari: (a) relied on Mr Tanabalan to hold the view – and did genuinely hold the view – that the assets which Mr Tanabalan had set aside amounted at least to $1.5m; and (b) did hold a belief that she was acting consistently with the legal advice received, or at the very least, that she was not acting inconsistently with it. I therefore cannot make a finding that she was acting in flagrant or contumelious disregard of the mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction in any of the respects which I have found her to be liable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 Further, as regards the third charge against Mdm Mageswari, the amount involved in the withdrawal from the SCB SGD account is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in both absolute and relative terms. The impact of this dealing on the underlying purpose of the mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction – to preserve assets and to protect the plaintiff from a risk that those assets might be dissipated before judgment – is thus not sufficient to warrant imprisonment. As I noted earlier, committal to prison is a measure of last resort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Similarly, the seventh charge against Mdm Mageswari concerns her failure to account to the plaintiff for monies spent on legal advice and in the ordinary and proper course of business. That failure is a failure to disclose sums which the defendant would have been entitled to spend in any event. It also bears noting that the plaintiff did not press for this disclosure contemporaneously, from month to month after the injunction was granted in August 2012, even though it must have been apparent to the plaintiff and its solicitors that the defendant was in persistent breach of this provision. The plaintiff complained of this failure only at the time it sought committal for contempt. That suggests to me that the defendant’s failure did not cause the plaintiff, on its own assessment, any substantial prejudice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 I find further that the fact that the plaintiff did not press the respondents to make this disclosure on behalf of the defendant contemporaneously further contributed to the defendant’s erroneous assumption – which at the very least was not inconsistent with the legal advice received – that this disclosure was not required (see <span class="font-italic">Clement</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Tanabalan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 I have found him Mr Tanabalan liable on the third charge against him. That concerns his acts in assisting or permitting the defendant’s failure to ensure that it did not deal with or dispose of assets up to the value of $1.5m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Although the assets which were disposed of by Mr Tanabalan, and which formed the basis of the third charge against him, were of not insignificant value, I am doubtful that this caused the plaintiff much prejudice. I bear in mind that it has consistently been the plaintiff’s position in these contempt proceedings that the values of the physical assets listed in the affidavit of assets were inflated. I have found that part of the plaintiff’s case to be true. It seems to me that, due to the intrinsic nature of the defendant’s business, assets and finances, the plaintiff had little prospect of recovering substantial sums against the defendant in any event, quite apart from any breaches of the mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 I also find that, to the extent that Mr Tanabalan overvalued the defendant’s assets, this was due to optimism and incompetence rather than due to dishonesty or a desire to mislead the court or to deprive the plaintiff of assets against which to levy execution. Optimism and incompetence are equally capable of impeding the due administration of justice as dishonesty. But a finding of optimism and incompetence suffices to take this case out of the line of authorities which establishes when a custodial sentence is warranted. This includes <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>, <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span> and <span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsusho</span>. So while Mr Tanabalan is guilty of contempt, I do not consider that his contempt warrants a custodial sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 As against both respondents, I also bear in mind that Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan did exhibit on occasion a desire to comply with the mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction and to cooperate with the plaintiff. This can be seen, for example, from their letter dated 25 March 2014, in which they informed the plaintiff’s solicitors that 36 assets worth $1.5m had been moved. They notified the plaintiff of the new locations of these assets though they were under no continuing obligation to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In these circumstances, I consider that the appropriate penalty for contempt for each respondent is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I order Mdm Selvarajoo Mageswari to pay a fine of $25,000; if she is unable to pay the fine within one month, she is to serve a term of imprisonment of one month in lieu thereof; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I order Mr Ramasamy Tanabalan to pay a fine of $50,000; if he is unable to pay the fine within a month, he is to serve a term of imprisonment of two months in lieu thereof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 Although Mr Tanabalan has been found guilty of only one charge of contempt and Mdm Mageswari of three, I consider Mr Tanabalan’s single breach to be more serious than Mdm Mageswari’s three breaches, even when they are taken together. That is because Mr Tanabalan’s breach went to the root of the purpose of the mareva injunction, which is to preserve assets from dissipation. That is also because Mr Tanabalan, as I have found, was well aware that that would be the effect of his contempt. As a result, I consider it appropriate that Mr Tanabalan’s fine for his single breach is double the fine which I have imposed on Mdm Mageswari for her three breaches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 I make a final point. The plaintiff appears to think that the purpose of committal is to make the plaintiff whole for the loss it has suffered by reason of having fewer assets upon which to levy execution in order to satisfy its judgment debt. That is not the purpose of committal. Committal is not execution by other means. The purpose of committal is to vindicate the court’s authority by sanctioning and deterring those who act in disregard of that authority as expressed in an order of court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 I have found both respondents guilty of contempt of court. Those breaches necessitated these committal applications. The plaintiff has been put to considerable expense and delay as a result. The plaintiff is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to the costs of these applications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 However, it is the case that the plaintiff has failed in the bulk of its charges. Mdm Mageswari has been found guilty only on three of the seven charges against her and Mr Tanabalan found guilty only on one of the seven charges against him. It is also the case that I have, as an extraordinary indulgence to the plaintiff, granted the plaintiff leave under O 52 r 5(3) to proceed against the respondents on charges which were not encompassed in the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statements. Those charges could have been rejected out of hand, with the plaintiff ordered to pay the respondents’ costs of dealing with them. While I have not taken that course, I consider that I am justified at this stage in depriving the plaintiff of costs on those charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 In these circumstances, I order that the respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay to the plaintiff 50% of the plaintiff’s reasonable costs and disbursements of and incidental to the committal applications. I have reduced the plaintiff’s recovery on costs by 50% to reflect that the plaintiff has succeeded on only four out of the 14 charges of contempt against the respondents and has avoided an adverse costs order on the charges outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 The plaintiff has asked that its costs be assessed on the indemnity basis. One of the grounds it relies on is the fact that these proceedings have been protracted by reason of the respondents’ conduct. I do not attribute the length of time that these committal applications have taken to fault on the part of the respondents. It is true that several adjournments were necessitated because they asked for additional time to prepare for hearings, to engage counsel or to look for funding to engage counsel. However, I accept that the respondents are impecunious. Further, I accept that having representation – especially in a matter of such gravity as committal for contempt – is not only of assistance to the alleged contemnors but also to the court in ensuring that justice is achieved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In any event, in light of my findings on Mdm Mageswari’s state of mind, I am not prepared to order indemnity costs against her. As against both respondents, I consider that the plaintiff’s approach in bringing multiple charges of contempt in three committal applications militates against an order for indemnity costs. If the plaintiff had brought only the three successful charges against Mdm Mageswari and only the one successful charge against Mr Tanabalan and had succeeded on those four charges, I might have considered awarding indemnity costs on the ground that the respondents would <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span> have unreasonably resisted committal applications which had been wholly-successful. But as it is, I cannot say that either respondent acted unreasonably in defending the overly-broad committal applications which the plaintiff chose to bring.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The costs payable to the plaintiff will therefore be assessed on the standard basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 All three of these committal applications have been motivated by a sense of grievance on the part of the plaintiffs. As the plaintiff says:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Plaintiffs take the position that Mdm. Selvarajoo Mageswari and/or the [defendant] ought not to get off scot-free. Mdm. Selvarajoo Mageswari’s and Mr. Ramasamy Tanabalan’s assurance “to cooperate with the Plaintiffs to find out the whereabouts of the [Transvictory and Singatac assets] and keep them informed of the outcome of [Mr Tanabalan’s] efforts to locate the [i]tems at the scrap yards in the country” is certainly not satisfactory to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs have been financially deceived by the [defendant] on numerous occasions, and have been further deprived of their fruits of litigation due to the [defendant’s] own failure to make payment of their alleged outstanding rental and/or loan charges which were due. It remains clear that the [defendant] ought to be liable for [its] failure to comply with the Mareva Injunction order and/or make full restitution to the Plaintiffs’ claim in Suit 373 of 2012 as well as all the unpaid costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 The plaintiff’s sense of grievance is completely understandable but ultimately misconceived. In committal applications – and especially in these committal applications, in which the plaintiff initially sought to commit each respondent to prison for a term of six years – it is incumbent on a plaintiff to come to court with more than a sense of grievance, no matter how justified. It was therefore incumbent on this plaintiff to conceive a case for multiple contempts of court against the respondents which is internally consistent and which is supported by evidence sufficient to discharge its burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This it has abjectly failed to do on the bulk of the charges presented. On the remaining charges on which the plaintiff succeeded, I am not satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Navinder Singh and Jaspreet Kaur Purba (KSCGP Juris LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Simon Tan and Grace Seng (Attorneys Inc LLC) for the respondents.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
