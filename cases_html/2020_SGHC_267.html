However, the appellant had testified that the massage bed in the room was not used for offering Thai massages, a fact which was corroborated by Vivian. Accordingly, it would be reasonable to assume that any official price list of the Gym would not have included Thai massage as a service. The victim had therefore either given incorrect evidence of having been shown a massage price list, or the appellant had prepared the price list as part of a premeditated plan. However, the respondent did not produce a copy of this alleged price list during trial. There was also no evidence that there was a computer and printer in the Gym from which the appellant could have printed the counterfeit price list, and it was improbable that he would have had time to do so. Further, the victim did not give evidence of the price of a Thai massage.

This raised the issue of whether the victim had any motive in giving Dr Pramanick a dramatic retelling of her version of events.

The victim’s explanation that she needed to head home to take care of her child was a cogent one. The victim had explained that she did not know that a report could be made online and had intended to go to a police station after work such that she could give a statement right away. It was also understandable for her to contact Vivian as she had wanted to warn the staff of the Gym about the appellant’s conduct. The victim’s explanation for not abruptly leaving after the sexual assault was also persuasive. She was concerned that the appellant, being a Muay Thai instructor who was stronger than her, could have hit or raped her.

</div> Given that the alleged incident had taken place in 2016 and the appellant was no longer working at the Gym, it would not be surprising that neither the appellant nor the respondent would have access to a price list that the Gym used in 2016. More importantly, it was not disputed that the appellant had given the victim a free Thai massage. As such, the production of a price list would not go very far in aiding the appellant to show that the alleged incident did not take place.

The appellant argued that the victim did not react when he allegedly massaged her inner thighs the second time, and that this rendered her account less credible. However, the victim had clearly testified during cross-examination that the first time, the appellant had stopped at her inner thighs and massaged her at that area. Conversely, the second time, the appellant had gone “straight up” and “didn’t had [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] a pause at the inner thighs”.

</div> her account is clear that the appellant did not pause at her inner thighs for a sufficiently long period of time for her to react to it. The appellant’s description of the victim’s lack of reaction to the second time he massaged her inner thighs was based on a mischaracterisation of her evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The appellant argued that the victim’s evidence was also not credible as she was willing to leave her vaginal area exposed instead of covering it with the towel during the massage. However, as submitted by the respondent, the victim was wearing her underwear which would have covered her vaginal area. She was uncomfortable being massaged in the area around her inner thighs, and she had indicated this to the appellant by moving her legs. When the appellant moved back down to her calves, she did not have a reason to apprehend any danger and pull down the towel to cover the back of her thighs, where she was comfortable being massaged at.

This answer was not inconsistent with her previous evidence, and there was nothing apparently contradictory with her evidence as to the depth to which the appellant’s finger was inserted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The fact that the victim was wearing “bikini” style underwear and was lying in a prone position does not render it physically impossible for the “in and out” digital insertion motion she described to have taken place. There was no evidence before the court showing how the act of digital vaginal penetration was physically impossible for these reasons. Moreover, even on the appellant’s own defence, he could possibly have accidentally touched her vagina. I pause to note that the two arguments of physical impossibility and possible accident are irreconcilable in that they stand as binary options. The appellant seemed to be wholly cognisant of this. I shall address these aspects of the appellant’s arguments more fully in due course at [59]–[73] below.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The DJ accepted the victim’s account of an “in-and-out” penetration, and I did not see how her account was illogical or not in accordance with the available evidence. The DJ had also accepted that the victim had satisfactorily explained her decision to allow the appellant to continue with the massage even after he had “fingered” her. The victim was concerned that, given the state of undress she was in, the appellant might overpower her and escalate his acts should she abruptly decide to end the massage and leave. I agreed with the DJ that this was a perfectly plausible explanation. Further, nothing turned on whether the door at the ground floor was locked from the inside during the massage. The victim had candidly testified that she was able to open the door and let herself out, and that she did not see the door being locked by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The victim’s delay in reporting the alleged incident</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In respect of the appellant’s argument that the victim did not report the alleged incident on the day itself or tell her friends or family members about the incident, I did not think that this delay affected the victim’s credibility. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohd Ariffan</span>, the court is to consider the explanations given by the complainant for his or her delay in reporting the offences to the police or disclosing the assault to anyone else, including his or her family members. A delay in reporting did not necessarily, on its own, undermine the credibility of a complainant, and the effect of any delay had to be assessed on the specific facts of each case (<span class="font-italic">Mohd Ariffan </span>at [66]–[68]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The victim had explained that she did not head to the police station on the day of the incident itself as she had wanted to go home to take care of her sick child. She also explained that she did not want to be “judged” by her friends and family, although she may have actually meant to say “misjudged”.

</div> The victim had given a reasonable explanation for the delay, and this delay – which, in any event, was only less than a day before Vivian had pre-empted her by making a police report – should therefore not be held against her.

It was undisputed that the victim had visited KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital on 2 October 2016 and that a medical report had been prepared. The relevant section of the medical report dated 31 October 2016 prepared by Dr Pramanick stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The alleged assailant involved is [the appellant], a Muay Thai instructor. According to [the victim], on 01 October 2016, she was at the Muay Thai School at Joo Chiat Road when [the appellant] (a Muay Thai Instructor) offered to give her a massage. She accepted the offer and at around 3.30 pm the massage started in a closed massage room in the school. She was lying down on her abdomen[.] She only had her panties on her. [The appellant] proceeded with the massage, 20 minutes into the session he inserted his hand into her panties and his finger into her vagina. <span class="font-italic">She immediately pushed him away and shouted at him.</span> He withdrew his finger and carried on with the massage for another 20 minutes. They parted after the massage. The massage was in a <span class="font-italic">single room with locked doors</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The appellant argued that the victim’s account of events in the medical report was inconsistent with her evidence at trial, which did not involve her pushing the appellant away after the alleged incident. When shown the medical report during cross-examination, the victim testified that she did not push the appellant away, but she did shout at him. The area where the massage was carried out also did not have locked doors but only had curtains. She further testified that she was not given a chance to confirm the accuracy of the report as it was not shown to her by the doctor at that point in time.

Based on Dr Pramanick’s evidence, the recounting of the incident by the victim was relatively brief. The medical examination lasted 29 minutes, during which the following steps were taken, as described by Dr Pramanick:

The report stated that she had seen the victim on 3 October 2016, but she had in fact seen the victim on 2 October 2016. Further, the report incorrectly stated that the victim had tested negative for a condition named Gardnerella in respect of the VP3 test, when the victim had in fact tested positive for it.

As compared to the medical report, this record of events was personally sent by the victim by text message to Vivian. Vivian testified that over the phone, the victim “said very specifically that [the appellant] fingered her and gave her Thai massage”.

</div> I did not think that on these facts, the inconsistency in the medical report should be attributed to the victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In respect of the appellant’s argument that the medical evidence pointed towards there not having been a sexual assault, Dr Pramanick’s evidence was that if the perpetrator had sexually penetrated a victim with one finger and if a victim had been sexually active, it would be possible for her to not suffer any visible injury. Following from the doctor’s evidence, I found that the victim not suffering any visible injury was a neutral factor in determining whether the alleged incident had taken place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On a holistic assessment of the evidence, I agreed with the DJ’s assessment that the victim’s evidence was unusually convincing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Credibility of the appellant’s defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I accepted the respondent’s arguments that the appellant’s defence was inconsistent, and that he was not a credible witness. There was a clear inconsistency between his initial case (which was repeatedly put to the victim) that he could have accidentally touched her vaginal area, and his subsequent testimony maintaining that there could not even have been an accidental touch. On appeal, he went even further to argue that the contact was physically impossible. Saying that there had been a possible accidental touch and absolutely denying the physical possibility of any touch at all are distinctly inconsistent positions. This fortified my view that the DJ was correct in highlighting the appellant’s inconsistency as a consideration that affected his credibility.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The appellant’s defence of physical impossibility</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The respondent’s case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the sexual assault was an “in-and-out” penetration) was based on the victim’s testimony and consistent. The appellant had argued in the proceedings below that it would not have been possible for him to sexually penetrate the victim as he did not massage her at the inner thigh area, and the victim’s vaginal area was covered by her underwear and the towel. To this, the victim had testified that the appellant had stuck his finger underneath her underwear, and that the towel was not covering her vaginal area.

</div>  On appeal, the appellant then further submitted that it would not have been physically possible for him to have penetrated her in an in-and-out motion as it would go against human anatomy. According to him, this was because the vaginal area was oriented downwards and would have been completely covered either by the towel or the victim’s “bikini” style underwear, and the victim’s thighs would have been closed at the time of the massage.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is well-settled that the prosecution must prove the guilt of an accused person beyond a reasonable doubt and that it is incumbent on the prosecution to address any gaps in its case (<span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1087 at [72]–[77]; <span class="font-italic">Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [81]; <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [59]–[61]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 486 (“<span class="font-italic">GCK</span>”) had conceptualised the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in two ways. First, a reasonable doubt may arise from within the case mounted by the prosecution. Should such flaws in the prosecution’s case be identified, weaknesses in the defence’s case would not ordinarily be able to bolster the prosecution’s case (<span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [134], [142]). Second, a reasonable doubt may arise on the assessment of the totality of the evidence. In this regard, the assessment of the prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing” standard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence, which logically includes the defence’s case. The defence needs to bring the prosecution’s case below the requisite threshold by pointing to such evidence that is capable of generating a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution fails to rebut such evidence, it would fail in its overall burden of proving the charge against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">GCK</span> at [135], [144]–[145]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my assessment, no gaps had surfaced in the respondent’s case theory in respect of whether the “in-and-out” penetration was physically possible. This was a case which boiled down to the victim’s words against the appellant’s, and the victim’s testimony had been consistent. As submitted by the respondent, the victim was not given the opportunity to respond to any of the claims regarding physical impossibility which the appellant had raised only on appeal.

</div> I did not think that the appellant had adduced evidence or pointed to any evidence which gave rise to a reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The claims made by the appellant on appeal were based purely on speculation and conjecture. No evidence had been adduced by the appellant regarding this alleged physical impossibility either at the proceedings below or on appeal. In his submissions on appeal, the appellant had produced an illustration allegedly representing the female anatomy to support his argument that digital vaginal penetration in an in-and-out motion was physically impossible as the victim was lying in a prone position. However, no explanations were advanced as to why this would inexorably be physically impossible to achieve, aside from a mere assertion (based on the illustration produced) that the vaginal orifice was facing downwards. The appellant’s other arguments supporting the alleged physical impossibility, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that penetration in the manner testified by the victim was not possible as her vagina would have been covered by her underwear or a towel and the victim’s thighs would have been closed during the massage, were similarly made without any evidentiary basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The appellant’s submission that the victim’s own evidence contained an admission of such physical impossibility was without merit. The section of the victim’s testimony relied upon by the appellant had clearly been taken out of context. The victim had testified:

Only after building up this case in a detailed and methodical manner did he put to the victim that the appellant might have accidentally touched her vaginal area and that it was merely an accident.

</div> As can be seen at [68] above, when the court again sought further specificity on the defence’s position with regard to the accidental touch, Mr Silvester put forth more details to support the line of argument. It is reasonable to infer that all these factual details were at Mr Silvester’s disposal because he had obtained instructions from the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Cheong Ngan alias Lee Cheong Yuen v Public Prosecutor and Other Applications </span>[2004] SGHC 91 made the following observation in the context of criminal revisions following plead guilty mentions at [28]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In many petitions for criminal revision, the accused often challenges defence counsel’s conduct of the case. Yet many of these allegations are often unfounded, and are raised by the accused only in a desperate attempt to escape the rigours of the law. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Eng Hock</span>, ([23] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the petitioner pleaded guilty, but later sought criminal revision on the ground that he had misunderstood his counsel’s advice. While he was convinced of his own innocence throughout, he thought that his counsel had advised him that a plea of guilt would not occasion a custodial sentence. In dismissing the petition, I made the following observations at [10] of my judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the conduct of defence counsel could be so easily challenged, the chilling effect on the criminal Bar would be immense. While there may in some cases be a thin line between dispensing credible legal advice and pressurising one’s client to plead guilty, it is undesirable to allow defence counsel to be made convenient scapegoats, on the backs of whom “backdoor appeals” are carried through.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Similar principles should apply in the situation of a trial. If the appellant had disagreed with the defence being put forth by his counsel, he could and should have instructed his counsel accordingly. He did not do so. Neither did he inform the trial judge that counsel had acted, as it would appear from the appellant’s claims on appeal, on a frolic of his own. Only on appeal, after the DJ had made a finding that his defences had been inconsistent, did he surface the allegation that counsel was not acting upon his instructions in raising the defence of accident. Moreover, based on what was recorded in the transcripts, I did not think that Mr Silvester had mounted the defence of accident on his own accord. This bolstered my reading of Mr Silvester’s statement that he did not have instructions to be only a response to the court’s question as to whether he could provide further specificity, and not to extend to the entire defence of accident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I also agreed with the respondent’s submission that even if the questions were put to the victim as a hypothetical, they would still be materially inconsistent with the appellant’s case that he did not even massage the area near her inner thighs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Mr Silvester]: Witness, I’m instructed that every time client does a massage, every time the---the accused does the massage and he’s going to massage the groin or buttock area, he would ask for the---the client’s permission. Did he ask for your permission before massaging the---the groin or buttock area?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Victim]: No. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This question was again fundamentally inconsistent with the appellant’s own evidence-in-chief that he had never massaged the area near the victim’s inner thighs and therefore could not possibly have accidentally touched her vagina. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In addition, the DJ rightly gave weight to the appellant’s inability to provide any credible explanation as to why he had denied performing the massage on the victim when he was confronted by Vivian. He maintained this denial when questioned by the police. In the police statement, the appellant did not only deny giving her a massage or committing the offence, he went further to allege that the victim had a hidden motive to extort the Gym, stating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 … The reason why I reported to the police is <span class="font-italic">because I did not want [the victim] to extort money out of the company. I felt that it is very weird and she may ask for monetary compensation.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12    <span class="font-italic">I do not know what [the victim’s] hidden agenda is?</span> I did not ask her to strip and lie on the massage bed. I did not offer massage service or perform any massage on [the victim]. I did not do anything indecent or obscene to her. All I did was to speak to her with regard to my company packages and made a cup of Kopi O Kosong. She drank the Kopi O Kosong and left the gym. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In this connection, the appellant’s repeated and vehement denials about performing the massage would explain why he was prepared to agree with his Gym co-founders to report the matter to the police. Having lied to Vivian that he did not perform any massage, he had no qualms repeating his lie to the police, and even embellishing it to impute a sinister motive to the victim. These contemporaneous reactions were simply not consistent with his pleas of innocence. His various explanations for lying – that he thought he was in “deep trouble”, that the odds were stacked against men when complaints of sexual assault are made, and yet did not think it was serious to lie in his police statement – are dubious and implausible. More tellingly, it was suggested on appeal that he was concerned about protecting the Gym but he did not want to tell Vivian about something he should not have done. If all that he had done had only been to give a free Thai massage in a bid to secure a potential customer’s interest, it is difficult to see why he could not have been upfront about this from the outset. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The appellant’s “shakedown” allegation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The appellant further suggested on appeal that the victim had falsely accused him of the offence for some ulterior purpose, in a threatened “shakedown” akin to blackmail or extortion. This was not put or suggested to the victim when she was cross-examined. In any event, the suggestion that the victim was seeking to extract monetary compensation is not borne out by the objective evidence and I did not see any basis to draw such an inference from her text messages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For reference, the messages which relate to the “shakedown” allegation state as follows:

Miscommunication and ambiguity can arise given the need for brevity. From the victim’s text messages as set out above, however, they were clear in conveying her grievance over the appellant having done something “very wrong” as he had “actually fingered” her in the course of the massage. It was untenable for the appellant to suggest that the use of the words “very unhappy” was unusual for a victim of sexual assault and that these words instead showed that she was merely a disappointed customer who had experienced poor service. This would entail selectively reading far too much into the victim’s choice of words without appreciating the full context of her messages. If there had been any underlying improper motive, it did not make sense for the victim not to make her intentions much more plain and obvious when she communicated with Vivian. The victim also did not keep in contact with Vivian or any of the staff members of the Gym after her phone correspondence with Vivian. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The DJ was thus entitled to accept that the victim had no reason to fabricate a serious allegation of sexual assault against the appellant. The appellant himself conceded that he could not conceive of any reason why she should have chosen to falsely implicate him. The appellant did not discharge the evidential burden to show that the victim had a plausible motive to falsely implicate him (see <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 3 SLR 34 at [215]–[216]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The appellant also argued that Vivian’s testimony showed that she was similarly under the impression that the victim might have an improper motive, which was why she decided to make a police report so as to protect the Gym.

At any rate, Vivian did not do so purely or even primarily for these reasons. She had intended for the police to look into the matter to determine whether the alleged incident had taken place as she could not independently ascertain whether the appellant’s or the victim’s version was true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 For all of the above reasons, I upheld the appellant’s conviction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appeal against sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Appellant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I turn next to the appeal against sentence.

The sentencing bands did not capture the full range of seriousness for offences involving digital vaginal penetration. In particular, they did not account for cases which had no offence-specific aggravating factors,  which according to the appellant included the present case, or cases where the offence-specific factors were less aggravated than that in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Nai Hock </span>[2016] SGDC 48 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock</span>”)<span class="font-italic">. </span>In <span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock</span>, the offender had held himself out as an alternative medicine practitioner. He penetrated the victim’s anus and vagina with his finger by falsely representing that he was treating her for infertility. He faced 14 charges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to two to three years’ imprisonment per charge, and a global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment. No caning was imposed as the offender was over 60 years of age. The offender’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The appellant proposed that the lower bound of Band 1 in the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework<span class="font-italic"> </span>should have been set at less than four years’ imprisonment. In making this argument, the appellant compared the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework to the sentencing bands set out in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>”) in respect of offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, and <span class="font-italic">GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">GBR</span>”) in respect of offences punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The appellant argued that the <span class="font-italic">upper limit</span> of Band 1 in the sentencing bands set out in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran </span>and <span class="font-italic">GBR </span>was about one-fifth of the statutory maximum sentence, whereas the lower bound of Band 1 in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>was about one-third of the statutory maximum sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The appellant contended that the DJ had erred in finding that abuse of trust was an offence-specific aggravating factor in this case, as it was not reasonable for the victim to have placed trust in the appellant. The appellant was also not in a position of responsibility vis-à-vis the victim, such as in a doctor-patient relationship, and he had only met her for the first time that day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87  The appellant further argued that his sentence of seven years and four months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the case, falling within Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, was disproportionate. The appellant compared the sentence imposed in this case to sentences imposed in cases of outrage of modesty and aggravated outrage of modesty, and submitted that lower sentences were imposed in those cases despite the presence of aggravating factors which were far more serious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The appellant also argued that the DJ should have considered that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework should not have been strictly applied as there were no aggravating factors present and a very low degree of culpability and harm caused. The present case was less serious than that in <span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock</span>, and a sentence lower than the global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment imposed in that case would therefore be appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The appellant further argued that the DJ’s decision on sentence was wrong in law and manifestly excessive when the facts of the present case were compared to the cases which the DJ had relied upon in coming to her decision, namely <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri and others </span>[2020] 4 SLR 790 (“<span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Wee Teong Boo</span> [2019] SGHC 198, the last of which has since been overturned.  The DJ should have imposed a sentence that was far lower than that imposed in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The appellant thus submitted that an appropriate imprisonment term would be two years’ imprisonment, following the individual sentences imposed in <span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock </span>which was the most analogous precedent, and four strokes of the cane or such number of strokes as to adequately register the court’s disapproval of the appellant’s conduct. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Respondent’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The respondent submitted that the DJ had appropriately considered the factual matrix and decided that it fell within Band 1 of the framework in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>. The DJ had correctly found that abuse of trust was an aggravating factor in this case, but had erred on the side of caution in finding that premeditation in this case would not be considered as an aggravating factor. The respondent argued that the appellant had acted in a manner which was “deliberate, calculated and considered” and that the offence was therefore premeditated.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Court of Appeal had laid down the sentencing framework for offences of sexual assault by penetration in <span class="font-italic">Pr</span><span class="font-italic">am Nair</span>, which was calibrated downwards from the framework in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 (<span class="font-italic">“Terence Ng”) </span>for rape offences.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It would be absurd to peg the sentence for offences of sexual assault by penetration to that of outrage of modesty, as the former offences are more egregious.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Band 1 in the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework applies to a situation where there are no aggravating factors. There was nothing so exceptional in the present case warranting a departure from the prescribed range of sentences in Band 1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Court of Appeal had specifically cautioned against relying on <span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock </span>as a precedent for individual sentences.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) There were offence-specific aggravating factors present in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The relevant sentencing framework for offences of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code is set out in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair. </span>The framework essentially requires the sentencing court to consider the offence-specific aggravating factors to identify the appropriate sentencing band within which the offence falls (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [159]; <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50], [53] and [57]). The said bands are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Band 1</span> (seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane): These cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors, or such factor(s) are only present to a very limited extent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Band 2</span> (10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane): These cases usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Band 3</span> (15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane): These involve the most serious cases, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 After identifying the sentencing band within which the offence falls, the court should then take into account any offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors to determine the appropriate sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 As submitted by the respondent, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>had transposed the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework applicable to rape offences to the offence of digital penetration by lowering the range of starting sentences for each band to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [159]). It is clear that the framework in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>was intended to capture the full range of seriousness in offending, including cases where there were no offence-specific aggravating factors or where these factors were present to a limited extent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I make a brief comment in respect of the appellant’s contentions that the lower bound of Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>sentencing framework should not start at about one-third of the statutory maximum sentence. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>had commented on the lower bound of ten years’ imprisonment in Band 1 of the framework for rape offences, noting that it was the judicial benchmark sentence for rape of all forms, as established in <span class="font-italic">Chia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [49]). The lower bound in the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework would similarly amount to a benchmark sentence set for digital penetration offences (involving penetration using a finger), and there was nothing objectionable about the court setting such a benchmark sentence. As the respondent also pointed out, offences involving sexual assault by penetration are generally more egregious and invasive than offences of outrage of modesty, and there was therefore no reason to peg the starting point in the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework to that of <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran </span>or <span class="font-italic">GBR. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I also agreed with the respondent that the appellant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was misplaced. This case pre-dated the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework and the prosecution had not appealed against the sentence. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>had categorised the case, which had only one offence-specific aggravating factor, as a case which would have fallen within Band 1. The court noted that the global sentence imposed in that case was seven years’ imprisonment and was therefore still broadly “somewhat consistent” with the Band 1 sentencing range, but the individual sentences of two to three years would be “some distance” from the sentencing bands. The court then explicitly cautioned against relying on the case as a precedent for individual sentences (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [169]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The Court of Appeal also considered other precedent cases which it would categorise as falling within Bands 2 and 3, and noted that the actual sentences imposed in those cases were lower than the minimum sentences specified in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>for the respective sentencing bands. The court then stated that those cases “should not as a rule be relied upon”, and that a judge who was minded to give a similar sentence as that imposed in those cases must set out clear and coherent reasons for departing from the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>sentencing bands (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [170]). It is clear that the sentences for cases decided pre-<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>have to be viewed with circumspection, and that the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>should apply barring exceptional facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The DJ found only one offence-specific aggravating factor – abuse of trust. She formed the opinion that there was at best limited abuse of trust, and properly considered that the assault was momentary and not persistent. I agreed with her characterisation of this case as falling within the low end of Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework. I saw no reason to treat this as such an exceptional case as to fall completely outside the framework.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The court in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>had suggested the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton</span>”) as an example of a case which might call for a departure from the prescribed sentencing bands for rape offences (at [49]). In <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton, </span>the parties were in love, and had engaged in intimate and consensual sexual activities close in time to the rape and even after the rape itself, which pointed to the incident as one which was wholly unplanned and unforeseen (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton</span> at [119]). Given that similar offence-specific aggravating factors that apply to rape offences would also apply to offences involving sexual assault by penetration, it is conceivable that a case with exceptional facts similar to those in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton </span>could warrant a departure from the prescribed sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Anddy Faizul bin Mohd Eskah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] SGCA 113 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Anddy</span>”), the offender pleaded guilty to and was convicted on nine charges, with 59 charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, all of which were sexual offences. The offender was a youthful offender who was approaching 16 years of age at the time of the earliest offence and was aged 18 years by the date of his last offence. The Court of Appeal stated that it had little reason to disagree with the High Court Judge’s ruling on the sentences for each charge as they were in line with the sentencing frameworks in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>and <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Ng</span>. I note that the court also upheld two of the individual sentences for sexual assault and rape which were below the lowest ends of the sentencing frameworks in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>and <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>respectively<span class="font-italic">. </span>The Court of Appeal stated that the mitigating factors and the totality principle had been given sufficient consideration by the High Court Judge, resulting in the comparatively low sentences. Pertinently, the court stated that it had “little doubt that had the [offender] been older, his sentence would have been more severe” (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Anddy </span>at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the present case, the victim and the appellant were strangers, and the appellant had opportunistically sexually assaulted the victim during a massage. The appellant was also not a young offender. There was nothing exceptional about the present facts such that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework should not apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I also did not think that the DJ had erred in comparing the present case to <span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pr</span><span class="font-italic">am Nair</span>, and in drawing her conclusion that the sentence in this case should be lower than that imposed in the two precedent cases. The DJ had correctly considered that the conduct of the offenders in those cases was more culpable, and categorised the present case as one falling within the lower end of Band 1 in the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The appellant was a first-time offender, but he had claimed trial and was thus not entitled to any sentencing discount. I was unable to find any substantial mitigating factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the circumstances, I was of the view that the DJ’s calibration of the sentence was appropriate. The sentence was not manifestly excessive. While lower sentences may have been imposed in past cases on broadly similar facts, this is largely explicable on the basis that all the precedents cited on behalf of the appellant either pre-dated <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> and/or did not specifically concern offences under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the above reasons, the appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed. I was satisfied that there was no reason to differ from the DJ’s decision. She had not erred in law or in her findings of fact. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yu Kexin (Yu Law), Devathas Satianathan (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) and Poon Guokun Nicholas (Breakpoint LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kavitha Uthrapathy (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
