        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Ms Lim Jen Lin, is an experienced
                    lawyer and intelligent individual. She came to Singapore from Malaysia at the
                    age of 15 on an ASEAN scholarship awarded by Singapore’s Ministry of
                    Education and studied in two of Singapore’s top schools: Raffles
                    Girls’ School and Hwa Chong Junior College. She later read law in
                    university, graduating with a bachelor degree from the University of Kent in
                    1988 and a master of law from the University of Cambridge in 1990. The plaintiff
                    was later called to the Singapore Bar in 1991 and practised law in law firms in
                    Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong for some seven years. She started in Drew
                    &amp; Napier LLP (as it then was) in Singapore, before moving to Rashid &amp;
                    Lee, a Malaysia law firm for a year and spent another year in Freshfields in
                    Hong Kong. She returned to Drew &amp; Napier as a salaried partner in January
                    1996 before leaving it in April 1998 to work as an in-house legal counsel in oil
                    and gas companies. The first is Edison Mission Energy Asia Pte Ltd (Singapore),
                    where she worked as Deputy Regional General Counsel (Asia) and a “key
                    member of its senior management team” in Asia from May 1998 to March
                    2001. In the second, ChevronTexaco, the plaintiff worked as Corporate Counsel
                    (Asia, Middle East, Central &amp; South Asia) from June 2001 to early 2004. In
                    ChevronTexaco, the plaintiff was “responsible for all legal advisory and
                    activities related to its substantial financing, trading and marketing global
                    business units”. She then resigned to join the defendant, Energy Market
                    Company Pte Ltd as its Company Secretary and General Counsel from 1 March
                    2004 to 1 December 2005, when she resigned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 5 January 2011, almost six years after
                    the plaintiff left the defendant’s employ, she commenced Suit No 4 of 2011
                    against it for a variety of alleged unpaid remuneration and bonuses. The
                    plaintiff’s claim for unpaid remuneration and bonuses is based on
                    misrepresentation and breach of her contract of employment. The plaintiff avers
                    that the defendant promised to pay her at least $302,000 a year. She says that
                    she would not have left ChevronTexaco for the defendant but for this agreement.
                    She says she was earning $304,577.50 yearly in ChevronTexaco and was not
                    prepared to suffer a large pay cut. The defendant disputes this on the ground
                    that the employment contract specified her pay as $220,000 per annum. The
                    employment contract was in the form of a letter of appointment dated
                    28 November 2003 and signed by the plaintiff on 1 December 2003. The
                    complete terms will be the subject of trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff has gone through four sets of
                    lawyers since commencing Suit No 4 of 2011. When the plaintiff took out Summons
                    No 6503 of 2012 on 19 December 2012 for specific discovery of documents,
                    she was represented by Braddell Brothers LLP. By the time the summons for
                    specific discovery was heard by the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) on
                    3 March 2014, she was represented by Peter Low LLC. The AR heard and
                    dismissed the application. Dissatisfied, the plaintiff appeals. This
                    registrar’s appeal arises from that dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I first heard the registrar’s appeal on
                    21 April 2014. This hearing was adjourned as the plaintiff, who was to
                    appear in person (as she discharged her lawyers from Peter Low LLC on
                    17 March 2014), was absent. I informed the defendant’s lawyers who
                    were present to notify the plaintiff that if she fails to attend the hearing
                    again, her appeal would be dismissed. The appeal was then fixed for hearing on
                    30 June 2014. The plaintiff wrote to say that she was not present for the
                    hearing as she was in the Supreme Court library photocopying documents for her
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the meantime, the plaintiff sought two
                    extensions of time on account of ill health. The first was made by way of a
                    series of letters dated 23, 25 and 27 June 2014 by the plaintiff to the
                    Supreme Court Registry (“Registry”). The plaintiff says she is
                    suffering from anaemia and that as a result, she suffered a “dramatic
                    drop in [her] blood levels”. In this regard, she submits letters from
                    three doctors in Malaysia in support of her request. The third letter from the
                    doctor sent on 27 June 2014 states that the plaintiff was unfit to attend court.
                    I granted the plaintiff’s request for adjournment. The hearing was
                    adjourned to 18 August 2014. On 11 August 2014, the plaintiff wrote
                    yet again requesting that the hearing on 18 August 2014 be adjourned to a
                    date in October 2014 on account of ill health. In support, the plaintiff
                    attached a letter from a Malaysian doctor who states that she “continues
                    to remain lethargic and has developed symptoms of headache, nausea and
                    vertigo”. The doctor goes on to state that the plaintiff is “not
                    medically fit to attend court”. The defendant’s lawyers from Rodyk
                    &amp; Davidson LLP responded to the plaintiff’s letter within the day
                    objecting to the plaintiff’s request on the ground of “inordinate
                    delay” in the hearing of the registrar’s appeal. As the
                    registrar’s appeal was delayed for a considerable period of time, I was
                    not prepared to grant the plaintiff a further extension.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I heard the registrar’s appeal on
                    18 August 2014. The plaintiff (who represented herself) was present. I
                    found the plaintiff’s submissions (both written and oral) to be rambling
                    and repetitious. The plaintiff also filed and served further submissions and a
                    several stacks of documents purporting to be her reply submissions out of time.
                    These added no further merit to her case. The plaintiff’s present
                    application for specific discovery is for a total of 15 classes of documents.
                    Even though the plaintiff seeks a total of 15 classes of documents, they can be
                    classified into just six main groups:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first (Classes 1, 2, 11 and 12)
                        pertains to wide-ranging internal documents and communications of the
                        defendant. The plaintiff claims that these are needed as they relate to her
                        hiring, the terms on which she was hired and the representations made to her
                        prior to her employment by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second group pertains to two classes of
                        documents (Classes 3 and 4) that are ‘relevant to the letter of
                        2 March 2004’. This letter, the plaintiff alleges, is a second
                        contact document from the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third group (Classes 5 and 6)
                        relate to the plaintiff’s performance as an employee with the
                        defendant. The plaintiff says that these documents are relevant to help her
                        show that the performance bonus which the defendant paid to her was in fact
                        not a true performance bonus, but paid pursuant to the alleged promise which
                        the defendant had made to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     The fourth group (Classes 7 and 8) pertains to documents
                        relating to her alleged termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     The fifth group (Classes 9 and 10) are documents
                        ‘relevant to the remuneration and/or intended remuneration of the
                        plaintiff as an employee of the [d]efendant’. The plaintiff claims
                        that these documents are relevant because they go towards proving whether
                        there are further terms agreed between the defendant and
                    herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_f"></a>(f)     The sixth
                        group (Classes 13 to 15) relate to documents and records taken by the
                        defendant’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) in
                        the course of their audit of the defendant. The plaintiff says in her
                        affidavit filed on 23 January 2013 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]he notes that PWC made or took during the course of its audit would
                            therefore be relevant because they would tend to show that (i) I have
                            all along maintained by position as to what the [d]efendant had said to
                            me prior to my agreeing to take up employment with the [d]efendant and
                            (ii) what PWC itself found, in relation to whether my assertions were
                            true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s case for specific
                    discovery was considered by the AR. He rejected the plaintiff’s
                    application for specific discovery in all but one (the sixth group, or Classes
                    13 to 15) of the above groups. I need concern myself only with the first five
                    groups of documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I start with the first group of documents the
                    plaintiff is seeking to discover (Classes 1, 2, 11 and 12). The
                    plaintiff’s own pleaded claim is one for breach of contract, or
                    misrepresentation in the alternative. These causes of action are founded on
                    contractual documents and communications between the plaintiff and the
                    defendant. The allegations do not concern the defendant’s own internal
                    communications. As such, the documents in this group are of no relevance to the
                    plaintiff’s claim, and should not be disclosed. In any event, I note that
                    the defendant has already disclosed a substantial amount of documents to the
                    plaintiff relating to the interviewing, selection, salary negotiations with and
                    recruitment of the plaintiff. These include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Initial Reference Report of the
                        plaintiff by a recruitment firm (Heidrick &amp; Struggles) submitted to the
                        defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Confidential Candidate Appraisal by Heidrick &amp; Struggles relating to the
                        plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Approval paper submitted by the defendant’s Chief Executive Officer
                        (CEO), Mr Allan Dawson to the defendant’s Remuneration &amp;
                        Appointments (“R &amp; A”) committee for approval to hire the
                        plaintiff and to negotiate a salary within the range of $220,000 to
                        $260,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Draft

                        and her remuneration was considered, discussed and
                    approved;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_f"></a>(f)     Email
                        correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant on the discussion,

                        employment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_g"></a>(g)     Finalised terms of employment signed by the plaintiff and the defendant;
                        and</p>

                        the plaintiff’s appointment.</p>

                        other things, the terms on which the plaintiff was to be
                    remunerated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_g"></a>(g)     Communications showing the plaintiff pressing for certain further benefits
                        and improvements on the terms of employment, and replies from the defendant
                        showing that some were acceded to and some were not; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_h"></a>(h)     The finalised terms of the
                        plaintiff’s employment, agreed to and signed by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In contrast, the plaintiff has not been able
                    to point to a shred of evidence that substantiates her assertion that there was
                    a promise made by the defendant to pay her $302,000 a year. There is no
                    justifiable basis on which I can or should grant the plaintiff’s
                    application for specific discovery of these documents. Her attempt at specific
                    discovery seems to be not only speculative but oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I also deny the plaintiff’s application
                    for specific discovery of the second group of documents, <em>ie</em> those in Classes 3 and 4. These documents, the plaintiff
                    says, is ‘relevant to the letter of 2 March 2004’. The letter
                    of 2 March 2004, the plaintiff alleges, is a second contact document from
                    the defendant to the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s application for this group
                    of documents is not specific enough – it merely states that the defendant
                    must disclose documents that are ‘relevant’ to the letter of
                    2 March 2014 without providing details of the exact documents she is
                    seeking. It is neither clear if this second group of documents exists. I am also
                    of the view that it is both pointless and unnecessary to order specific
                    discovery of this group of documents - the 2 March 2014 letter merely
                    reproduces the pre-contract terms set out in an email to the plaintiff on
                    27 November 2003 and was given only because the plaintiff requested for it
                    as she wanted the pre-contract terms set out in a formal letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff’s application for specific
                    discovery of the third group of documents (those in Classes 5 and 6) is also
                    unmeritorious. Her argument that the documents are relevant to help her show
                    that the performance bonus which the defendant paid to her was in fact not a
                    true performance bonus, but paid pursuant to the alleged promise which the
                    defendant had made to her contradicts her own pleaded case. The
                    plaintiff’s statement of claim states that the second tranche of her
                    performance bonus in 2004 (amounting to $23,693) was never paid to her. Yet, her
                    affidavit filed in support of her application for specific discovery states that
                    she was paid, but this payment was pursuant to the alleged
                promise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The fourth group (Classes 7 and 8) of
                    documents are that the plaintiff say relate to her alleged termination of
                    employment. The plaintiff’s application for specific discovery fails for
                    two reasons. First, the plaintiff’s employment was not terminated. It is
                    her own pleaded case that she resigned. Second, even if the plaintiff’s
                    employment was terminated and there are documents relating to her alleged
                    termination of employment, these documents are completely irrelevant to the
                    issues in the suit. Her claim is not for wrongful termination. Instead, the
                    claim is for breach of contract and misrepresentation on the part of the
                    defendant in failing to pay her $302,000 per annum and bonuses (and not just
                    $220,000 per annum).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The fifth group of documents (Classes 9 and
                    10) are documents which the plaintiff says has to be disclosed to find out
                    whether she was paid under the written agreement or under an oral contract. This
                    is an irrelevant issue and I therefore do not grant the plaintiff’s
                    application for specific discovery of this group of documents. There is no
                    dispute that the plaintiff was paid under written terms and not an oral
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Email and internal documents may be ordered to
                    be disclosed if they are relevant. The plaintiff has not made out any clear
                    argument as to why she is seeking the documents in her present application in
                    spite of the voluminous documents submitted by her for this appeal. Even her
                    submissions contradict her case as pleaded. In her reply submissions she
                    referred to the letter of appointment only as a ‘collateral
                    contract’ and that the main contract was the oral contract. Her claim in
                    this action is for breach of contract in not having been paid according to the
                    contract of employment. She has a problem because the contract does not support
                    any of her claims and is thus compelled to rely on oral terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     So far as her allegations of an oral contract
                    are concerned, she realises that those claims would require corroboration; which
                    she is unable to provide. I therefore agree with Mr Pan that the
                    plaintiff’s application for further discovery here is nothing more than a
                    speculative exercise. It appears to me that the plaintiff has no clear idea what
                    documents exist, and thus has no idea what she wants. For the reasons given, I
                    am of the view that the AR had rightly dismissed the application. This appeal is
                    dismissed with costs to the defendant in any event. I will hear parties on the
                    quantum of costs if they are unable to agree.</p>
