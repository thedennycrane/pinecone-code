        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by the applicant, Mah
                    Kiat Seng, (“MKS”) , who appeared in person, for leave to refer a
                    series of some 26 questions to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 397 of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“s 397 CPC 2010”).
                    As this application to court was made out of the prescribed time, MKS also
                    prayed for an extension of time to make the application. In anticipation that
                    his questions might not have been formulated correctly, he further asked that
                    the court, if it thought it fit, to reframe those questions
                    appropriately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The present application arose from MKS’
                    conviction in the District Court of two charges under the Registration of
                    Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RCA”). These charges were,
                    respectively, for his refusal to provide a blood sample (contrary to s 13E(5)(a)
                    of the RCA), and to have his finger impressions and photograph taken (contrary
                    to s 13(2)(a) of the same Act). The District Judge’s (“DJ”)
                    decision can be found at <em>PP v Mah Kiat Seng</em> [2010]
                    SGDC 315 (“<em>PP v MKS
                (DC)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       MKS appealed against the DJ’s decision to
                    the High Court in Magistrate’s Appeal No 184 of 2010 (“MA
                    184/2010”). The appeal was partially allowed; Choo Han Teck J
                    (“the Judge”) allowed MKS’ appeal in respect of his
                    conviction vis-a-vis the failure to provide a blood sample but dismissed his
                    appeal in respect of the refusal to have his finger impressions and photograph
                    taken. The Judge’s decision in MA 184/2010 can be found at <em>Mah Kiat Seng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] SGHC 320
                        (“<em>MKS v PP (MA)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       MKS then applied to the High Court in Criminal
                    Motion No 42 of 2010 (“CM 42/2010”) to reserve 22 questions of law
                    of public interest to the Court of Appeal under s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“s 60 SCJA”). The Judge
                    dismissed this application. Section 60 SCJA has since been repealed w.e.f. 1
                    January 2011 and replaced by s 397 CPC 2010. The Judge’s decision in CM
                    42/2010 can be found at <em>Mah Kiat Seng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2011] SGHC 47 (“<em>MKS v PP
                        (CM)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Dissatisfied with the Judge’s decision not
                    to reserve those questions of law which he contended were questions of public
                    interest, MKS brought the present Motion (“the Motion”) to obtain
                    what he failed to obtain from the Judge. In the Motion, he listed 26 questions,
                    of which 22 were <em>identical</em> to those which he
                    raised before the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Judge found the 22 questions raised by MKS
                    to be “rambling, repetitious” and was of the view that
                    “many concerned not questions of law but fact”. He summarised the
                    nature of MSK’s complaint to involve two aspects. The first was factual,
                        <em>viz</em>, whether the police had requested that MKS
                    provide his finger impressions and photograph. To this extent, the Judge was of
                    the view that the long list of questions which MKS enunciated were in fact
                    questions of fact and not questions of law of public interest, as MKS claimed
                    that they were. The second aspect of MKS’s complaint involved a question
                    of law, which was whether the RCA “applied to compel a suspect as opposed
                    to a convicted criminal”. On this aspect, the Judge was of the view that
                    s 8(a) of the RCA provided a clear and unequivocal answer to this question of
                    law. Under s 8(a) of the RCA, “[a]ny authorised officer may take or cause
                    to be taken the finger impressions and photographs of “any person under
                    arrest” who is accused of any crime”. As s 8(a) of the RCA
                    expressly states that it applies to “any person under arrest”, the
                    Judge had little problem in answering the question of law posed to him in the
                    affirmative. Accordingly, he found that there was no basis to reserve any
                    questions to this Court for its determination and thus dismissed CM
                    42/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Main issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On the basis of the prayers set out in the
                    Motion, the main issues which were presented to this court were, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether an extension of time to refer
                        new and further questions of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal
                        under s 397 CPC 2010 can and should be granted, given that the High Court
                        had rejected an earlier application filed within time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether, should an extension of time to
                        file an application under s 397 CPC 2010 be granted, leave to refer the
                        questions as framed by MKS to this Court ought to be
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether,
                        should leave to refer the questions as framed by MKS not be granted, there
                        are nonetheless issues of law of public interest such that the Court of
                        Appeal should reframe the questions tendered by MKS to reflect those
                        issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the conclusion of the oral hearing before us,
                    as MKS had not shown that there were in fact questions of law of public interest
                    which ought to be reserved for the consideration of this Court, we dismissed the
                    application. We now give our reasons for doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The critical question of the application in the
                    Motion relates to the issue as to whether, of the 26 questions listed, any of
                    them are questions of law of public interest which ought to be reserved for the
                    consideration of this Court. In his oral submission to us, we asked MKS to focus
                    on this critical question. In these grounds, we do not wish to elaborate on the
                    first issue listed at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above, as even if
                    an extension of time was granted, MKS’s application for leave to appeal
                    would still not have succeeded in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       We thus turn to the second issue (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), on which we would make these
                    observations. It would be noted that MKS made this application pursuant to s 397
                    CPC 2010 which came into force on 1 January 2011 and superseded s 60 SCJA. While
                    the substantive clause of s 397 CPC 2010 is largely similar to that of s 60
                    SCJA, an important difference between them is that under s 397 CPC 2010, it is
                    the Court of Appeal, and not the High Court (as it was under s 60 of the SCJA),
                    which assesses the question/s that the applicant seeks to refer to the Court of
                    Appeal. In other words, previously such an application had to be made to the
                    High Court which decision would be final. Now the application would have to be
                    made directly to the Court of Appeal, which will decide whether there is such a
                    question of law of public interest which it should address. However, we would
                    underscore the fact that as the operative clause of the two provisions are
                    identical (both visualised the reference to the Court of Appeal of only
                    “any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter
                    and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the
                        case”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> we see no reason why the principles
                    established by case law under s 60 SCJA, as to how the court should exercise its
                    discretion in granting leave, should not be of relevance to an application under
                    the current s 397 CPC 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     MKS’s application in CM 42/2010, made on
                    15 November 2010, under s 60 SCJA which was then in force, was turned down by
                    the Judge on 10 February 2011. In the meantime, on 2 January 2011, s 397
                    CPC 2010 came into force and replaced s 60 SCJA. This Motion was his second
                    attempt to have the alleged questions of law referred to the Court of Appeal.
                    Was MKS entitled to do so? It seems to us that MKS was not entitled to make this
                    application under s 397 CPC 2010 for two reasons. First, it would amount to an
                    abuse of process, even though this application contains four more questions than
                    the first. He should not be allowed a second bite of the cherry. Second, and
                    more importantly, regulation 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Transitional
                    Provisions – Further Proceedings and Joint Trials) Regulations 2011
                    (“CPC Transitional Regulations”) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an accused has been charged for any offence before 2nd January 2011,
                        any proceeding (which includes any pre-trial proceeding, trial, criminal
                        motion, criminal appeal, criminal revision or criminal reference) in
                        relation to that offence may be taken or continued, as the case may be,
                        after that date and everything in relation thereto may be done in all
                        respects on or after that date as if the Act had not been enacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The CPC Transitional Regulations were deemed under regulation 1 of the
                    same to have come into operation on 2 January 2011. Thus, regulation 2, and in
                    turn s 397 CPC 2010, would apply to anyone charged with an offence on and after
                    2 January 2011. In the present case, MKS was charged and convicted of the
                    offence while s 60 SCJA was still in force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, notwithstanding our views on this
                    procedural point, our decision to dismiss the application was also based on the
                    critical issue that MKS had not shown that there was any legal question
                        <em>of public interest</em> which ought to be referred
                    to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on reference of questions of law of public interest to the
                Court of Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We now turn to consider the substantive issues
                    of MKS’s application. Section 397(1) CPC 2010 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court in the
                        exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction, and a party to the
                        proceedings wishes to refer any question of law of public interest which has
                        arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the Judge has
                        affected the case, that party may apply to the Court of Appeal for leave to
                        refer the question to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Like s 60 SCJA, s 397(1) CPC prescribes four distinct requirements
                    which must be satisfied before this Court may grant leave to refer any questions
                    of law of public interest for its further consideration. The four requirements,
                    as confirmed and applied in <em>Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2010] 1 SLR 966 (“<em>BMS</em>”) at [29], are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    there must be a question of <em>law</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the question of law must be <em>one
                                of public interest</em> and not of mere personal importance to
                            the parties alone;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the question must have arisen in the matter dealt
                            with by the High Court in the <em>exercise of its
                                appellate or revisionary jurisdiction</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the determination of the question by the High
                            Court must have <em>affected the outcome</em> of
                            the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In considering these four requirements and
                    deciding whether to grant leave to refer questions of law of public interest to
                    the Court of Appeal under s 60 of the SCJA, the position has always been that
                    the court’s discretion in this respect would be exercised sparingly (see
                        <em>BMS</em>, at [32], approving <em>Ng
                        Ai Tiong v PP</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 490 at [10]). Further, <em>BMS</em> reiterated the
                    position that the High Court judge hearing the s 60 application has the
                    discretion to refuse to refer a question of law of public interest stated by the
                    applicant, even if all the conditions thereof were satisfied (unless the
                    question was raised by the Public Prosecutor). However, strong and cogent
                    grounds had to exist before the High Court could refuse to refer a matter to the
                    Court of Appeal if all the conditions were satisfied. There is nothing in the
                    enactment of s 397 CPC 2010 which indicates that these approaches taken in
                    relation to s 60 SCJA should not continue to apply <em>vis-a-vis</em> s 397 CPC 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application of the law to the Motion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We do not propose to set out all the 26
                    questions which MKS had identified. Many of the questions are repetitive in
                    nature and merely restate identical or similar points. Some concerned
                    sufficiency of evidence to convict under the RCA, and others were based on
                    erroneous facts or a misunderstanding of the law. One question even queried if
                    he could be convicted of his refusal to provide finger impressions or allow
                    photographs to be taken when he was acquitted of the charge of failing to
                    provide a blood sample. Obviously this query was stated only to be rejected.
                    These aside, the other seeming questions of law may be grouped under three main
                    sets: (a) questions 1 to 3 and 14; (b) questions 4 to 6, 19, and 20; and
                    (c) questions 25 and 26. However, the threshold which MKS had failed to meet was
                    the element of public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The questions in set (a), <em>viz</em>, questions 1 to 3 and 14, concern the question of law which
                    the Judge considered in CM 42/2010. This was “whether the Registration of
                    Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) applied to compel a suspect as opposed to a
                    convicted criminal” (<em>MKS v PP (CM)</em>, at
                        [5]). This question is easily
                    answered, as the RCA provides a clear and unequivocal answer. Section 8, read
                    with s 13 of the RCA, explicitly provides that the Act not only obliges a
                    convicted person, but also a “person under arrest who is accused of a
                    crime”, to surrender his finger impressions and photographs when asked to
                    do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The questions in set (b), <em>viz</em>, questions 4 to 6, 19 and 20, concern a construction of the
                    words “finger impressions and photographs” (in s 8 RCA),
                    “his photograph and his finger impressions” (in s 13 RCA) and/or
                    any other such combination as used in the RCA. MKS appeared to be raising a
                    question as to what photographs or finger impressions must be given before a
                    person to whom the RCA applies may be regarded as having discharged his duty
                    under s  13 (read with s 8) of the RCA. In particular, he seemed to be
                    asking whether the provision of a single thumb print and a single frontal
                    photograph would suffice to discharge one’s duty under that Act. While on
                    the face of it, this set of questions does pose a question of law, its answer
                    should be apparent from the objective of the RCA, which is to institute a
                    registration system of criminals and related persons. Section 2 RCA defines
                    “finger impression” to include “thumb impression and palmar
                    impression”. “Photograph” is also defined in the same
                    section to include, in relation to a person, “the photograph of any
                    distinguishing feature or mark on the body of that person”. In s 2 of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), it is stated that “words in the
                    singular included the plural” and vice versa. In the light of these
                    definitions, a police officer would be acting within his power to request MKS to
                    allow photographs be taken of him and to obtain his finger impressions (which
                    would include palmer impression). It is clear from the wording of s 8 read with
                    s 13 RCA that persons who are under arrest and accused of a crime registrable
                    under the RCA are under a duty to submit to the taking of their finger
                    impressions and photographs when called upon do so. Police officers are
                    empowered to take such number of photographs and finger impressions as are
                    necessary for the criminal registration process. In this regard, we noted the
                    safeguard prescribed in s 10 RCA, which requires the destruction of finger
                    impressions and photographs of persons who are later acquitted or discharged of
                    the crime alleged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In relation to the facts of the case, the DJ
                    found, as a matter of fact, that initially, MKS did consent to the taking of a
                        <em>frontal view photograph of himself</em>, and also
                    did not object to the taking of his <em>thumb
                        impressions</em> (see <em>PP v MKS (DC)</em>, at
                        [6] and [8]). However, these were taken for the purposes of verifying
                    MKS’s identity (see <em>PP v MKS (DC)</em>, at [40]).
                    Later MKS was asked to have photographs taken of not only his frontal view but
                    also his left and right profiles, as well as to have all of his finger
                    impressions taken (not only his thumbs) including his palms and sides. He
                    refused in spite of explanations by the police officers that the finger
                    impressions and photographs were required as part of the criminal registration
                    process under the RCA, with repeated warnings of the consequences of
                    non-compliance. MKS’s argument was that as he had already agreed to the
                    taking of one frontal view photograph and provided his thumb impressions, that
                    should constitute partial discharge of his statutory duty to provide finger
                    impressions and photographs under ss 8 and 13 RCA. Accordingly, it was argued
                    that he could not be found guilty of the offence of non-cooperation under those
                    provisions. However, this assertion must be viewed in light of the evidence of
                    the police officers who said that they had informed MKS that the initial thumb
                    impressions and photograph had been procured for a different purpose to that in
                    respect of which he had refused to cooperate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     However, while we recognise that construction
                    of a statutory provision is a question of law, it does not follow that every
                    such question of statutory construction is necessarily a question of law of
                        <em>public interest</em>. If the construction that
                    could be placed on a statutory provision is clear, it would not be in the public
                    interest to reserve this legal question for the Court of Appeal as it would be a
                    waste of the court’s time: see <em>Ragunathan v Pendakwa
                        Raya</em> [1982] 1 MLJ 139 at 141-142. In the context of the present
                    case, the answer to the question raised is quite clear having regard to the
                    express previsions as well as the objects of the RCA, <em>ie</em>, to institute a registration system of criminals and related
                    persons. It is clearly not of such complexity as to warrant a reference to this
                    court. By way of information, it is to be noted that the established police
                    practice is to require finger impressions from “each and every finger of
                    both hands including thumb, palm and side impressions”, as well as
                    photographs of “frontal, left and right profiles” (see <em>PP v MKS (DC)</em>, at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Turning finally to the last set of questions,
                        <em>viz</em>, questions 25 to 26, both questions
                    concern issues which are settled and which could be answered by the application
                    or extension of established principles of law and the application of statutory
                    provisions which have been authoritatively construed by the court. <em>BMS</em> makes it clear at [37] that the “the mere
                    construction of words in statutory provisions in their application to the facts
                    of a case does not satisfy the requirement of public interest”. At the
                    same paragraph, it was also said that s 60 of the SCJA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... ought not be used to route to the Court of Appeal questions
                        “which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the
                        application or extension of established principles of law or the application
                        of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher
                        courts”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The fact that a question relates to a
                    particular provision which has not been interpreted judicially does not, without
                    more, render it to be of public interest; a new or novel question is not
                    invariably a difficult or contentious question and will not always satisfy the
                    public interest threshold (see <em>BMS</em> at [37],
                        <em>Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP</em> [1990] 1
                    SLR(R) 198 at [30] and <em>Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1037 at [78]). We would further add
                    that a question of law does not become one of public interest just because an
                    applicant is vociferous in raising related issues on that question. To construe
                    “public interest” in the manner in which MKS would like us to
                    adopt, namely, in every case where a point of interpretation of a statutory
                    provision arises, is to cast the net too wide. It would mean, more often than
                    not, that there would be a second tier of appeal by way of reservation of
                    questions of law. This would undoubtedly defeat the legislative purpose of s 60
                    SCJA that there should only be one level of appeal. Where an accused person is
                    tried before a subordinate court, he has a right of appeal only to the High
                    Court. He has no further right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. The process
                    provided in s 60 SCJA, and now s 397 CPC 2010, is an exceptional measure to be
                    resorted to only where a question of law of public interest arises. In this
                    context, public interest must therefore mean more than just questions of law or
                    questions of statutory interpretation. The legislature has in its wisdom
                    refrained from defining it. Conflict of judicial decisions on the point would be
                    such a case. At the very least, the point of law should be one of considerable
                    difficulty or complexity, the determination of which affects the public interest
                    rather than the narrow personal interest of an applicant who has been convicted
                    of an offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In conclusion, we would state that while some
                    of the questions raised may be questions of law, they are certainly not
                    questions of law of public interest. MKS was in effect seeking, by the
                    back-door, an appeal against the decision of the Judge. This we could not allow.
                    Accordingly, we dismissed the Motion.</p>
