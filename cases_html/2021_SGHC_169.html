However, the cross-appeal before me involves a charge amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC. <br/>Section 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC provides that for such amalgamated charges, the court may sentence the accused to twice the punishment which the accused would have been liable to (“the Maximum Enhanced Sentence”) for the offences being amalgamated (“the base offence”). Among other issues, this cross-appeal raises a novel question of whether the three-year imprisonment threshold in <br/>s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC takes reference from the maximum term of imprisonment in the base offence only, or the Maximum Enhanced Sentence of the amalgamated charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the material time, the accused was a Digital Marketing Manager at AAM Advisory (“the Company”).

Dr Lim elaborated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     The accused’s OCPD was previously undiagnosed and it affected his good judgement and contributed to the commitment of the offences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     The OCPD could <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">account for</span> some of his peculiar behaviour such as purchasing many similar items for example shoes for his wife, frequenting the same shop frequently and using the card repeatedly even though this increased his risk of being caught. He had rules about buying only things he could afford and not splurging on luxurious items. His intention of buying gifts for his parents was to his ease their pain and suffering. Hence he continued his obsessive buying even though his family had asked him to stop.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     His offences were a cry for help. His use of the credit card in a “repeated, persistent and careless” way was akin to depressed patients who shoplifted repeatedly until they were caught.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40  In his second report Dr Lim said that the OCPD had affected the accused’s good judgement and “There is indeed a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">causal link</span> between the disease (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) the accused is suffering from and his conduct (the use of credit cards and lapses in his judgment).”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41     In Dr Goh’s forensic psychiatric report dated 3 March 2020, Dr Goh diagnosed the accused as having OCPD and also suffering from a major depressive episode around the time of the offence. In his follow-up report dated 30 April 2020, Dr Goh further explained and elaborated on how both mental conditions had contributed to his commission of the offences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42  I reproduce both Dr Goh’s reports:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">3 March 2020</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24. I am of the opinion that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a)    He has obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). He also has <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">major depressive episode</span> around the time of the offences and he continues to have depressive symptoms now. His major depressive episode had occurred in the midst of a series of life events, such as his parents’ illnesses and his wife moving out just one year after they got married.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b)    The characteristics of his obsessive compulsive personality disorder (preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, control and being inflexible) and his depressive symptoms made it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">harder for him to cope</span> with the changes in his life then. His Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder and major depressive episode are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contributory factors</span> to his offences, in that his offence are part of his dysfunctional way of coping during this very stressful period.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c)    He was not of unsound mind at and around the material time of the offences, in that he was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">aware</span> of the nature and quality of his actions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">d)    He is currently fit to plead in a Court of Law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">e)    He appreciated the consequences of such wrongful acts on himself and his family and is now keen for treatment.

I refer to your request for clarification, specifically on whether the psychiatric conditions he is suffering from contributed to his conduct (use of credit card etc and lapse in judgement).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.    In my opinion, this major depressive episode and obsessive compulsive personality disorder <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contributed</span> to his conduct of the alleged offences in that both these conditions made it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">harder for him to cope</span> with the stressors in his life then. He had poor sleep and problems with his appetite and concentration, and lethargy from his depression, and together with his obsessive compulsive personality disorder (with his preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism and control, and being inflexible), these caused him to have difficulty in dealing with his problems effectively and impaired his judgement with regards to the criminal acts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.    His acts were his dysfunctional ways of coping and dealing with his stress and his depressive mood. He told me during his assessments that when he got the credit card and he was able to use the card without anybody stopping him, he thought it was a “godsend” and “so coincidental” even though he felt bad about it, and he rationalised to himself that he was “not harming anyone”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in underline; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Having considered these reports, the DJ held that although the accused “remained culpable for his acts as he was of sound mind and aware of the nature and quality of his acts, … his culpability had been lowered by his mental disorders as both had operated to <span class="font-italic">contribute</span> to the commission of the offences” [emphasis added].

In relation to s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>), she observed more generally that the legislative purpose of s 337(1) is to exclude certain offence-specific and offender-specific instances from the community sentencing regime, as Parliament has decided as a matter of policy that the community-based regime and rationale should not apply.

</div> In relation to ss 124(2) and 124(4) CPC, the DJ held that their legislative purpose “is to permit the framing of amalgamated charges against an accused when certain conditions are met to ensure that the accused is not prejudiced and has sufficient notice of the offences he is facing, without requiring prosecution to specify the time place date person or thing of each offence.”

</div> Accordingly, the threshold under s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) must take reference from the Maximum Enhanced Sentence for the Amalgamated Cheating Charge. It claims to find support for this reading in ss 337(5), 337(6) and 337(9) CPC: the “sentence of imprisonment” which a community sentence is in lieu of by virtue of s 337(5), and which may be suspended under s 337(6) and resurrected by s 337(9), must, where amalgamated charges are concerned, refer to the sentence imposed by virtue of the base offence read with <br/>s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii).

Each of these provisions empowers the court, in the event of a breach of an accused’s statutory obligations under a certain community order or the commission of a further offence, to “impose any sentence that is prescribed for the offence in respect of which the community order has been made”.

The base offence in the Amalgamated Cheating Charge is s 417 of the Penal Code. The maximum imprisonment term the accused is liable to under s 417 of the Penal Code and s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC is 3 years and 6 years respectively. In other words, if the DJ and accused are right that the word “offence” in <br/>s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC refers to the base offence, the whole range of community orders under Part XVII of the CPC is available. Conversely, if the Prosecution and Mr Leong are right, no community orders (including MTOs) are available to the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Evidently, this issue concerns a matter of statutory interpretation of <br/>s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC.

However, courts should never examine the provision in question in isolation.

Section 2(1) of the CPC defines “offence” to mean “an act or omission punishable by <span class="font-italic">any</span> written law” [emphasis added].

The accused’s course of conduct, which under s 124(4) CPC comprises “2 or more incidents of the commission of the same offence”, is the “act or omission” which is punishable. Section 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) then stipulates the punishment – 2 times the amount of punishment to which the accused would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged separately with the base offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, the foregoing begs the question: is the amalgamated offence in s 124(4) of the CPC <span class="font-italic">an </span>offence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a single offence)? The plain wording of the definition of “offence” in s 2(1) of the CPC covers a <span class="font-italic">single</span> act or omission. On the other hand, an amalgamated offence constituted under s 124(4) of the CPC comprises <span class="font-italic">multiple</span> acts or omissions, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “2 or more incidents of the commission of the same offence by the accused … [which] … taken together amount to a course of conduct (having regard to the time, place or purpose of each alleged incident)”. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, I am satisfied that an amalgamated offence constituted under s 124(4) of the CPC is a single offence in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, s 124(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC provides that the charge framed under <br/>s 124(4) is “deemed to be a charge of <span class="font-italic">one</span> offence” [emphasis added]. This deeming provision overcomes the tension in the plain wording of the definition of “offence” in s 2(1) CPC, and the fact that an amalgamated offence consists of multiple incidents of the same base offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, the following contextual clues are consistent with the deeming provision in s 124(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

</div> Section 132(1) provides the general rule that every distinct offence must be framed in a separate charge and every charge must be tried separately. If an amalgamated charge in s 124(4) were indeed a collection of discrete offences, this would violate <br/>s 132(1).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Section 132(2) of the CPC sets out the following exceptions to the general rule in s 132(1):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in the cases mentioned in sections 133 to 136, 138, 143, 144 and 145; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to charges to which the accused pleads guilty; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to charges which the accused and the prosecutor consent to be taken into consideration under section 148.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Of particular relevance are ss 133 and 134 of the CPC. Notwithstanding s 132(1), an accused person charged with more than one offence may be tried at the <span class="font-italic">same trial</span> for all of those offences if: (a) the offences form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character (s 133 CPC); or (b) if the offences comprise of one series of acts connected so as to form the same transaction (s 134 CPC). Reading ss 132(2), 133 and 134 together, the implication is that even when the latter two provisions are invoked, the accused’s multiple offences remain distinct in law. In contrast, s 132(2) CPC does not list s 124(4) as an exception to s 132(1). This is despite Parliament being aware of the interplay between these two provisions, as s 124(4) expressly begins with “[d]espite … section 132 …”. As such, the omission to list <br/>s 124(4) as an exception under s 132(2) indicates that such an amalgamated offence is a single offence in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The distinction between ss 133 and 132 is further underscored by <span class="font-italic">Mahender Singh Kadian v State of Haryana </span>(28 November 2008, High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh) (India). In that case, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana’s observations on s 219 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (Act 2 of 1974) (“ICCP”) are particularly illuminating for our purposes. Section 219(1) of the ICCP reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">219. Three offences of same kind within year may be charged together.</span>—(<span class="font-italic">1</span>) When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics and bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Section 219 of the ICCP is similar to s 133 of Singapore’s CPC as the former allows three offences of the “same kind” committed by the accused to be tried at a single trial. Crucially, the Indian High Court noted that the effect of s 219 ICCP “is not to make three offences which are tried together under its provision as one offence. The offences continue to be separate though there is only one trial for all of them.” In the same vein, s 133 of Singapore’s CPC does not deem offences of “the same or a similar character” to be a single offence. In contrast, the express language in s 124(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) CPC and the fact that s 124(4) CPC is not an exception to the rule under s 132(1) CPC leaves no doubt that such an amalgamated offence is deemed to be <span class="font-italic">one</span> offence, including for the purposes of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other contextual clues relevant to the meaning of “offence” in s 337(1)(i) CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Thus far, I have addressed the plain meaning of the word “offence” in <br/>s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) and examined whether a charge amalgamated under s 124(4) CPC falls within said meaning. I now turn to discuss contextual clues which indicate that the Broad View is the correct understanding of the plain meaning of “offence” when the proceeded charge is one amalgamated under s 124(4) CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I accept the Prosecution’s submission that ss 337(5), 337(6), 337(9), 352(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 354(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 354(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC demonstrate that the “term of imprisonment” which must not exceed 3 years under s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC refers to the Maximum Enhanced Sentence in s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC. It follows then that “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC should refer to the amalgamated offence if the proceeded charge is one amalgamated under s 124(4) CPC.

This flows logically from the fact that the sentencing jurisdiction of a court, which convicts an accused person in respect of an amalgamated charge, is no longer confined to the maximum sentence in the base offence. The court’s sentencing jurisdiction is augmented under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In a similar vein, the sentence of imprisonment which the court may impose on an accused person prior to the passing of a community sentence <br/>(s 337(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) CPC) or which may be suspended when any community order comes into force (s 337(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) CPC) must refer to the sentence imposed under the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction in s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). This reading of <br/>s 337(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) also entails that the sentence of imprisonment, which is originally suspended, but resurrected under s 337(9) when the community order is revoked, refers to the sentence imposed in light of s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Likewise, the sentence which may be imposed following the revocation of: (a) certain community orders for a breach of the accused’s statutory obligations (s 352(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) CPC); or (b) community orders in general, following the accused’s commission of and conviction for further offences while the community order is in force (ss 354(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 354(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)), takes reference from the sentencing court’s jurisdiction under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC. I find it implausible that Parliament would give the accused, who has his/her community order revoked under ss 352(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 354(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or 354(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), a sentencing discount by confining the court’s sentencing jurisdiction to that under the base offence (assuming that the charge the accused is convicted of is an amalgamated charge). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 All this is to say that the references to the sentence of imprisonment, in lieu of which a community order is imposed or which is subsequently resurrected for various reasons stipulated in the foregoing CPC provisions, must refer to that imposed in light of s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). Bearing this in mind, I see no reason for the “term of imprisonment” referred to in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) to then refer to the court’s sentencing jurisdiction under the <span class="font-italic">base offence</span>, rather than <br/>s 124(8)(a)(<span class="font-italic">ii</span>). It follows that “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) must refer to the amalgamated offence if the proceeded charge is one amalgamated under <br/>s 124(4) CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Finally, for completeness, I also agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the wording of ss 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the CPC is neutral to the issue of whether “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) refers to the base or amalgamated offence. I am unable to glean any guidance from these provisions and fail to see the force of the DJ’s reference to them in support of her decision.

These sentencing options enable the courts to deliver the correct mix of deterrence, prevention, retribution and rehabilitation on the specific facts of each case. Undergirding this regime of community sentences was the realisation that “[n]ot every offender should be put in prison”. In some cases, it is appropriate to allow the offender to remain gainfully employed and for his/her family to benefit from focused treatment (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 May 2010), vol 87 (“Second Reading of the CPC Bill 2010”) at col 422 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Crucially, Mr Shanmugam highlighted that community sentences target offences and offenders “traditionally viewed by the Courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum” such as “regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions” (Second Reading of the CPC Bill 2010 at col 422). At the Second Reading of the CJR Bill 2018, Ms Indranee Rajah reiterated that “community sentences can give those who commit <span class="font-italic">minor</span> offences a good chance at <span class="font-italic">rehabilitation</span> without unnecessary disruption to their lives” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 March 2018), vol 94 (Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law) (“Second Reading of the CJR Bill 2018”)). Further, as See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) stated in <span class="font-italic">Sim Wen Yi Ernest v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2016] 5 SLR 207 at [41], the framework of community sentences is:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… to enable offenders of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">less serious crimes</span> to be dealt with in ways other than by imposing fines or imprisonment to enhance their chances of rehabilitation without diluting the deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardising the public’s sense of safety (<span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Volume 1</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013)… at p 77)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Given this context, I now examine the specific purpose of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC. To give effect to the aims of community sentences (see [63]–[64] above), clause 337 of the CPC 2010 Bill “sets up the circumstances that prevent the making of a community order” (Second Reading of the CPC Bill 2010 at col 423). Clause 337 is the predecessor of s 337 in today’s CPC. s 337 is therefore intended to prevent offences or offenders which fall <span class="font-italic">outside</span> of the rehabilitation end of the spectrum from accessing the regime of community orders. s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC filters out offences punishable with more than three years imprisonment. Such offences, in Parliament’s view, are not at the rehabilitation end of the spectrum and engage the other three sentencing considerations of deterrence, prevention and retribution more strongly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Besides revealing the legislative purposes of Part XVII and s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC, the extraneous materials are useful in another respect. Namely, it is apparent from the CJR Bill 2018 that Parliament did not amend s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC when ss 124(4) and 124(8) were introduced in this bill. The former provision was introduced in its present form in the CPC Bill 2010. What is significant is that the CJR Bill 2018 contained amendments to other limbs of s 337(1), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, <br/>ss 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), (<span class="font-italic">d</span>), (<span class="font-italic">e</span>), (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">h</span>) (Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018 (Act 19 of 2018) (“CJRA 2018”) s 91). I agree with Mr Leong that at the very least, these amendments to s 337(1) suggest that Parliament chose not to amend <br/>s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>).

</div> Therefore, while there is no explicit cross-reference between ss 124 and 337, the fact that Parliament did not see a need to expressly clarify the relationship between these two sets of provisions must mean that their purposive meanings are harmonious. This is borne out in my analysis of the two provisions when the Broad View is adopted (see [43]–[52] above, [84]–[90] below). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sections 124(4) and 124(8)(a)(ii) CPC   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 However, the purpose behind s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC does not completely answer the question as to whether “offence” refers to the base or amalgamated offence. To put the issue into focus, let us recall that if the accused had been charged individually with each s 417 Penal Code base offence, under which the maximum imprisonment term is three years, he would qualify for a community sentence. In contrast, if the Broad View is correct, and the accused is sentenced under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC in respect of the Amalgamated Cheating Charge, he is precluded from a community sentence as the court’s sentencing jurisdiction is doubled. The question is whether there is a substantive difference between charging a person with individual base offences and an amalgamated offence, such as to justify precluding community sentences in the latter situation only. Answering this question calls for a close examination of the purpose of the device of amalgamation in s 124(4) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The starting point is Menon CJ’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2014] 4 SLR 892 (“<span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60] that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence. Therefore, it must be significant that the court’s sentencing jurisdiction is doubled under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC where <br/>s 124(4) amalgamated charges are concerned. In line with Menon CJ’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat</span>, ss 124(4) and 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC collectively signal the serious view Parliament takes of courses of criminal conduct which form the basis of an amalgamated offence in s 124(4). In a similar vein, Parliament has, in the past, enhanced the permitted sentencing range of certain classes of criminal action which were regarded as deserving of harsher punishment (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v BDB </span>[2018] 1 SLR 127 at [139]–[141]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, the device of amalgamation under s 124(4) CPC is not merely administrative or procedural in nature. Instead, amalgamation may be used to signal the higher<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">criminality</span> of the accused and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct. I find support for this view from the plain wording of <br/>s 124(4), as understood in the context of established sentencing principles, and English authorities discussing a similar amalgamation procedure in the UK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 First, the fact that an accused person committed a string of base offences, which incidentally constitute a “course of conduct” under s 124(4), is traditionally an aggravating factor. For instance, an individual who commits multiple acts of offending that result in the same outcome in terms of loss to third parties should, <span class="font-italic">ceteris paribus</span>, be treated more harshly than one who commits a one-off act entailing the same outcome. In the context of credit card cheating offences, V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Fernando Payagala </span>stated as follows (at [48]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The nexus between the number of offences and quantum involved was also discussed in [Lee Teck Leng in “Sentencing in Cheating Offences”, <span class="font-italic">Law Gazette</span>, August 2000 at 23]. Lee Teck Leng observed:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Amalgamating both perspectives, it would appear that the total sentence imposed on the serial cheat would probably be slightly higher than the sentence imposed on an offender convicted of a single cheating offence, if the total quantum is identical in both instances</span>. [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To this, I would add that sentences meted out in serial cheating cases should not be only “slightly higher” as compared to that assigned to a single offender for the same quantum. The sentence could in the appropriate circumstances be <span class="font-italic">significantly higher</span>. <span class="font-italic">A serial offender would be hard put to credibly submit that his conduct was the result of a momentary indiscretion</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Such serial offending heightens the culpability of the accused and shows his/her total disregard for the law (<span class="font-italic">Chua Whye Woon v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] SGHC 189 at [3(b)]). As a result, the consideration of deterrence is more forcefully engaged than if the same outcome was inflicted by a single offence, all other things being equal. From this perspective, it is fair for an accused convicted of an amalgamated offence causing a certain outcome to be precluded from community orders, even if these would have been available if he/she had inflicted the same outcome by a single offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 These observations may hold true even when we compare an accused person facing <span class="font-italic">X </span>number of charges of a base offence, and another facing an amalgamated charge consisting of <span class="font-italic">X </span>number of incidents involving the same base offence. Mr Leong highlights that to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged incidents amount to “a course of conduct”, the Prosecution must establish one or more of the factors in s 124(5) CPC: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) where the offence is one that has an identifiable victim, the victim in each alleged incident is the same person or belongs to the same class of persons;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) all of the alleged incidents involve the employment of the same method or similar methods;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) all of the alleged incidents occurred in the same place, in similar places, or in places that are located near to each other;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) all of the alleged incidents occurred within a defined period that does not exceed 12 months.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to Mr Leong, the requirement of establishing a course of conduct distinguishes the overall criminality of an accused facing an amalgamated charge.

</div>  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In some situations, I see the force of Mr Leong’s argument. Consider an accused facing five distinct simple theft charges alongside another who faces an amalgamated charge comprising five incidents of simple theft. In the former situation, the accused stole a pair of shoes from his/her neighbour on one occasion, some cash from a co-worker on another, and miscellaneous items from different retail outlets in different locations on the remaining three occasions. More than 12 months separates each offence. In the latter situation, on all five occasions, the accused stole vehicles parts from vehicles in a carpark in his office building during office hours. He used the same set of tools on each occasion and committed all five thefts within a month. In the latter situation, because the accused employed the same <span class="font-italic">modus operandi </span>(s 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)), targeted cars at the same carpark (ss 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)), and offended five times within the short span of a month (s 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)), the inference of premeditation is stronger and specific deterrence would feature more heavily in the sentencing equation. The amalgamated charge reflects the greater overall criminality of the accused in the latter situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 However, I will not go so far as to say that in <span class="font-italic">all</span> situations, the overall criminality of an accused facing an amalgamated charge comprising <span class="font-italic">X</span> number of incidents of the base offence is higher than the overall criminality of an accused facing <span class="font-italic">X</span> number of separate charges for the same base offence. The Prosecution and Mr Leong appear to accept as much.

</div>
</div> Everything will turn on the particular circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Nevertheless, this conceptual untidiness does not detract from my view – that the effect of amalgamation is more than procedural. This is because amalgamation incontrovertibly exerts a substantive effect on the court’s sentencing jurisdiction in s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC. I have difficulty accepting that the doubling of the maximum imprisonment term under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) should then be completely disregarded when determining the availability of community sentences under s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 What this means is that the Prosecution must take extreme care when framing amalgamated charges so as not to inadvertently preclude a deserving offender from receiving a community sentence. As Yong Pung How CJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Sim Gek Yong v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at [15], “[t]he onus lies on the Prosecution in the first place to assess the seriousness of an accused’s conduct and to frame an appropriate charge in the light of the evidence available.” That the exercise of prosecutorial discretion can affect the court’s sentencing options should come as no surprise. Even before this judgment, the Prosecution’s charging decision may preclude an offender from community orders. For instance, if the offender committed a single theft of component parts of a motor vehicle, the full gamut of community orders is available should the Prosecution charge him/her under s 379 of the Penal Code (maximum of 3 years’ imprisonment). In contrast, if the offender were charged with the aggravated variant of theft in s 379A (maximum of 7 years’ imprisonment), only an MTO is available by virtue of s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC. As always, the Prosecution’s exercise of its discretion is open to challenge on the grounds of bad faith and unconstitutionality (<span class="font-italic">Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney-General </span>[2012] 2 SLR 49 at [17]). These considerations address the DJ’s concern at [16(c)] above that an amalgamated charge concerning a base offence with a maximum prescribed punishment exceeding 18 months’ imprisonment is automatically excluded from a community sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Second, English authorities discussing a provision analogous to <br/>s 124(4) CPC also take the view that the role of amalgamation is to more accurately capture the criminality of the accused. Rule 10.2(2) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020 (SI 2020 No 759) (UK) (“UK CPR 2020”) allows the Prosecution to frame “multiple-count offences” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, amalgamated offences):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">More than one incident of the commission of the offence may be included in a count if those incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct having regard to the time, place or purpose of commission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In turn, Rule 10A.11 of the UK Criminal Practice Directions 2015 sets out the circumstances (non-exhaustive) in which a single count may allege more than one incident of the commission of an offence: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the victim on each occasion was the same, or there was no identifiable individual victim as, for example, in a case of the unlawful importation of controlled drugs or of money laundering;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the alleged incidents involved a marked degree of repetition in the method employed or in their location, or both;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the alleged incidents took place over a clearly defined period, typically (but not necessarily) no more than about a year;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) in any event, the defence is such as to apply to every alleged incident. Where what is in issue differs in relation to different incidents, a single “multiple incidents” count will not be appropriate (though it may be appropriate to use two or more such counts according to the circumstances and to the issues raised by the defence).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The English Court of Appeal’s statement in<span class="font-italic"> R v A </span>[2015] EWCA Crim 177 on the purpose of Rule 10.2(2) of the UK CPR 2020 (then Rule 14.2(2)) is highly instructive. The English court observed as follows (at [47]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he purpose underpinning multiple counts … is to enable the prosecution to <span class="font-italic">reflect the defendant's alleged criminality</span> when the offences are so similar and numerous that it is inappropriate to indict each occasion, or a large number of different occasions, in separate charges. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is immediately apparent from the foregoing extract that the ability to frame multiple-count offences is not simply a tool of convenience. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span class="font-italic">R v Cunningham (Christopher) </span>[2018] EWCA Crim 2704 (“<span class="font-italic">R v CC</span>”) further crystallises the role of multiple-count offences. In that case, the appellant was charged with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, four separate counts of rape, comprising two pairs of vaginal and oral rape which occurred on two separate occasions (at [14], [50]). The Prosecution had not framed a multiple-offence charge against the appellant. However, the Prosecution opened the case to the jury in these terms: “[t]he counts on the indictment do not relate to specific instances. They are designed to reflect the <span class="font-italic">repeated nature</span> of the allegations of rape” [emphasis added] (at [13]). The English Court of Appeal observed that this was “not an accurate description of the counts of rape” (at [14]). Each count charged a single event and the Prosecution had chosen not to charge the appellant for multiple-incident offences under Rule 10.2(2) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 (SI 2015 No 1490) (UK) (which is identical to Rule 10.2(2) of the UK CPR 2020) (at [14], [15]). Because of the way the charges were drawn, the court held that it had to sentence the appellant “simply for the specific offences of rape of which he had been convicted” and that it was “unable to reflect in his sentence the repeated nature of the offences of rape” (at [39], [40]). This was one reason, among others, that the court reduced the appellant’s sentence for the rape charges from 16 to 14 years’ imprisonment (at [2], [55]). Most telling is the court remark that “had the judge been in a position to sentence for the course of conduct and had [it] been in a position to assess the propriety of that sentence on the same basis, the result may well have been very different” (at [56]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 To be clear, I am not endorsing the proposition in <span class="font-italic">R v CC</span> that courts can never reflect the repeated nature of the offences in the sentence when discrete charges are preferred. On this point, Menon CJ’s observations in connection with the totality principle in <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2019] 4 SLR 838 at [20]–[23] remain authoritative. However, what is abundantly clear from the English authorities is that the option of framing multiple-count offences allows the Prosecution to better reflect the criminality of an accused when multiple offences are committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In the final analysis, I am satisfied that the English authorities reinforce my understanding of the substantive implications of ss 124(4) and 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) in the court’s sentencing analysis (see [69] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Choosing an interpretation that promotes the purpose of the underlying written law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 To recapitulate, I have found that: (a) the purpose of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC is to preclude offences which fall outside of the rehabilitation end of the spectrum from being susceptible to community orders (see [65] above); and (b) that a purpose of the device of amalgamation in s 124(4) is to allow the Prosecution to signal the higher<span class="font-italic"> </span>criminality of the accused and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In my view, the Broad View advanced by the Prosecution and Mr Leong better promotes Parliamentary intention behind ss 124(4), 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC. If the court’s sentencing jurisdiction under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC exceeds three years’ imprisonment, Parliament has deemed – by virtue of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC – that such amalgamated offences are too serious for a community order. In these cases, courts must give effect to Parliamentary intention by denying recourse to community orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In contrast, the Narrow View advanced by the accused would violate Parliamentary intention in the following ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 First, the Narrow View allows serious offences to access the community sentencing regime. Under the Narrow View, an amalgamated offence attracting a maximum imprisonment term of six years under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, base offence has maximum imprisonment term of three years) will be susceptible to a community sentence. However, a base offence with a maximum imprisonment term of six years is precluded from a community sentence (save for prescribed offences under s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC which remain liable to an MTO). It is therefore wholly inconsistent for the amalgamated offence to be able to be punished with a community sentence. This result would fly in the face of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)’s purpose, which is to ring-fence the regime of community orders from serious offences which primarily engage considerations of deterrence, retribution and/or prevention. Evidently, adopting the Narrow View may inadvertently expand the ambit of Part XVII of the CPC to include serious amalgamated offences which fall outside of the rehabilitation end of the spectrum. Notably, the Narrow View also involves <span class="font-italic">ignoring</span> the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction in <br/>s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC altogether. I find it difficult to accept that these effects were intended by Parliament.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Second, the Narrow View undermines the ability of the device of amalgamation to more accurately reflect the accused’s overall criminality. This contravenes the purpose of s 124(4). The point is best understood when considering an amalgamated charge which concerns any base offence with a maximum imprisonment term of more than 18 months but up to three years. Under the Narrow View, as “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC refers to the base offence, the full suite of community orders is available. Under the Broad View, where the Maximum Enhanced Sentence of the amalgamated offence becomes the benchmark under s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>), at best, only an MTO is available if the offence is a prescribed one (see s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC). In situations where an amalgamated charge is appropriately framed to reflect the accused’s greater overall criminality, the Narrow View may result in a community sentence which is disproportionately low. Any greater criminality signalled by the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction in s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC is disregarded under the Narrow View. s 124(4) CPC is thereby be stripped of its <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> role for the purposes of determining the availability of a community sentence for such amalgamated offences. I see no reason to circumscribe the role of s 124(4) CPC by adopting the Narrow View.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89  However, I have accepted that not in all cases will the overall criminality of an accused facing an amalgamated charge comprising <span class="font-italic">X</span> number of incidents be higher than the overall criminality of an accused facing <span class="font-italic">X</span> number of discrete charges for the same base offence (see [74] above). Put another way, it is conceptually possible for someone facing an amalgamated offence to still be deserving of a community sentence. However, in my judgment, the solution is not to read down the meaning of “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC, but to stress to the Prosecution that charging decisions should be made bearing in mind the impact this will have on the court’s sentencing options. Ideally, such a difficulty should never present itself before the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 For these reasons, I find that the Broad View advanced by the Prosecution and Mr Leong better furthers the purpose of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Addressing the remaining concerns highlighted by the DJ</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In this section, I will briefly address the DJ’s concerns with the Broad View which I have not yet covered (see [16] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 First, the DJ found it anomalous that mentally disordered offenders facing amalgamated charges for offences carrying a maximum prescribed punishment of more than 18 months’ and up to three years’ imprisonment will not be eligible for any sort of community orders at all, while mentally disordered offenders in similar circumstances committing more serious offences carrying maximum prescribed punishments above three years’ and up to seven years’ imprisonment are eligible for MTOs under s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC. However, for reasons explained at [73] above, if the offender is guilty of a course of conduct satisfying one or more of the factors in s 124(5), this may represent a higher degree of criminality than the commission of the same number of more serious offences which <span class="font-italic">do not </span>constitute a course of conduct under s 124(4) CPC. In such situations, the anomaly referred to by the DJ does not arise. Of course, where the converse is true, then an amalgamated charge should not be framed by the Prosecution in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, the DJ found it anomalous that a mentally disordered accused facing an amalgamated charge for simple theft is excluded from community orders, whereas a similarly mentally disordered accused facing an amalgamated charge for aggravated theft under ss 379A or 380 of the Penal Code would be eligible for an MTO as these aggravated forms of theft have been prescribed under s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC. However, I agree with the Prosecution that this anomaly will not arise because the Broad View of “offence” will apply equally to <br/>s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC (see [98] below). As a result, due to the doubling effect under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC, an offender facing an amalgamated charge for aggravated theft will exceed the seven years’ maximum imprisonment term threshold in <br/>s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and be precluded from MTOs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, the DJ was concerned that the Broad View did not align with the general legislative intent articulated in the Second Reading of the CJR Bill 2018 that community orders in general and also MTOs should be made available to a larger pool of offences and offenders. The DJ referred in particular to the addition of s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC in s 91(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) CJRA 2018.

</div> Ms Indranee Rajah’s caution, in the Second Reading of the CJR Bill 2018, that increasing the availability of community sentences will have to be done in a “controlled manner, to strike the right balance with deterring crime.” In this spirit, I do not think that expanding the availability of MTOs in s 337(2) discloses Parliament’s intention to adopt the Narrow View in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>), which will inevitably make community orders available for more amalgamated offences. This is a leap of logic that is unsupported by the text and context of the relevant provisions and the extraneous materials. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As such, my view on Issue 1 remains unchanged after considering these concerns highlighted by the DJ.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On a purposive reading of ss 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC, where an accused person is convicted of a charge amalgamated under s 124(4), the word “offence” refers to the amalgamated offence, rather than the base offence. Therefore, if the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC exceeds three years’ imprisonment, the court is statutorily precluded by s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) from imposing community sentences under Part XVII of the CPC even if each base offence of the amalgamated charge is punishable with an imprisonment term of three years or less.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 A corollary of the above is that the word “offence” in s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC must be interpreted in the same manner as s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC. There is nothing to suggest that the position is otherwise. To recapitulate, under s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), where an offence is punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, the offence must be identified in the Prescribed Offences Regulations in order for an MTO to be available. Since an amalgamated offence is distinct in law from its base offences, and the Prescribed Offences Regulations does not include offences amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC, amalgamated offences falling within this particular sentencing range are necessarily precluded from MTOs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In this case, the maximum imprisonment term under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC in respect of the Amalgamated Cheating Charge is six years. This exceeds the three year threshold in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC, thus precluding the accused from a community sentence. Given the Maximum Enhanced Sentence is up to six years’ imprisonment, the accused is also ineligible for an MTO as offences amalgamated under s 124(4) are not prescribed offences for the purposes of <br/>s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: what is the appropriate sentence?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Given my conclusion on Issue 1, it follows that the accused’s cross-appeal must fail. A SDO is not statutorily available and neither is an MTO. The remaining question is what the appropriate sentence should be. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Amalgamated Cheating Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What is the dominant sentencing consideration? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It is uncontroversial that as a starting point, deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration for cheating offences involving credit cards.

</div> The primacy of both general and specific deterrence is established in <span class="font-italic">Fernando Payagala</span> by V K Rajah J (at [49], [88]). The reasons for this include the fact that credit card fraud involves the deception of financial institutions and business establishments which is easy to commit but difficult to detect (at [19]), tarnishes Singapore’s standing as an international financial, commercial and transit hub and/or a preferred destination for tourism, trade and investment (at [20]) and inflicts intangible damage (on top of the actual amount involved in the credit card fraud) in the form of inconvenience, embarrassment, loss of reputation, and time and costs expended in investigations and to enhance security measures (at [49]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn </span>Menon CJ at [48], citing <span class="font-italic">Fernando Payagala</span> at [88], held that where the offence entails the misuse of a financial instrument or facility which threatens the conduct of legitimate commerce, general deterrence would take centre stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 However, the DJ eventually concluded that rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration, largely due to the contributory link between the accused’s two mental disorders and the offences.

Rather, in light of the insubstantial contributory link of the mental disorders in the circumstances of this case, and the fact that the accused’s offences involve the misuse of a financial facility which undermines the reliability of credit cards as a mode of payment, the need for general deterrence remains paramount. However, I subsequently mention (see [134] below) the relevance of the accused undertaking such IMH treatment to the issue of remorse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The six points above also distinguish the cases relied on by the accused to challenge the Prosecution’s appeal.

</div> Having considered the guidance in <span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn</span>, I agree with the Prosecution’s position. The Amalgamated Cheating Charge involves a sum of $20,642.48.

It is trite that planned and premeditated offences are more alarming, insidious and malignant, thus warranting more serious treatment.

This extended period of deception and repeated engagement in criminal activity evidences a disregard for the law. I am also giving effect to the court’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Fernando Payagala</span> that the sentence meted out to a serial cheater could be significantly higher than that imposed on a single offender for the same quantum (see [70] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In connection with level of harm in this case, it bears repeating that the accused’s offences involve the misuse of a financial facility which undermines the reliability of credit cards as a mode of payment and Singapore’s reputation as an internationally respected financial, commercial and investment hub. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Further, while the accused made full restitution voluntarily, thereby reducing the economic harm inflicted, I am unable to ascribe this significant mitigating weight.

</div> Even further still, the following email that the accused sent to Diners Club on 6 April 2020 undermines any suggestion that restitution was made out of genuine remorse. In this email, which post-dates the making of restitution, the accused informs Diners Club that the “mistake to [it] … has been fixed” and that if Diners Club “drop[ped] the case against [him] … [he] can continue contributing to society in a meaningful way …”.

</div> This was a clear attempt to lobby Diners Club to drop the charges against him in the misguided belief that it had the legal power to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 For these reasons, I agree that at least 12 months’ imprisonment is appropriate before considering the mitigating value of the accused’s mental disorders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 However, as the Prosecution accepts, the sentence imposed must account for the contributory link between the accused’s mental disorders and the commission of the offences in the proceeded charges. Dr Goh reasoned that the accused’s OCPD and major depressive episode made it harder for him to cope with the changes in his life then, including his parents’ illnesses and his wife moving out just a year after they got married.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> While I earlier found that the impact of these mental disorders does not displace deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration, it is not wholly devoid of mitigating value. For the reasons described in Dr Goh and Dr Lim’s psychiatric reports, the presence of the two mental disorders reduces the culpability of the accused. Therefore, lowering the sentence to eight months’ imprisonment is a fair and just outcome.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Further downward adjustment on account of offender-specific factors?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I now consider the relevance (if any) of certain offender-specific mitigating factors raised by the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 First, the accused argues that hardship to himself and his family is mitigating. In particular, he points to the fact that he needs to support his family (including his parents) and that he took “quite some time” to find a new job. However, it is trite that hardship to the offender’s family or himself/herself is not mitigating, save in exceptional circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Lim Bee Ngan Karen v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1120 at [71]–[72]; <span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2017] 5 SLR 755 (“<span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [110]). I am not satisfied that such exceptional circumstances arise in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Second, the accused highlights his charitable works, including donating blood before his arrest and supporting environmental causes, presumably to demonstrate his good character. However, Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin</span> [2017] 5 SLR 671 (“<span class="font-italic">Alvin Lim</span>”) at [23] (citing his earlier judgment in <span class="font-italic">Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter</span> [2017] SGHC 143 at [100]–[101]) explained that alleged charitable or other good works cannot be regarded as mitigating on some form of social accounting that balances the past good works of the offender with his/her offences. The only basis on which limited weight might be given to such works is if they are sufficient to demonstrate that the offence in question is a one-off aberration, which might then displace the need for specific deterrence. However, the modest mitigatory weight attached to evidence of good character and/or public service can be displaced where other sentencing objectives assume greater importance (<span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester</span> at [102(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In view of the principles in <span class="font-italic">Alvin Lim </span>and <span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester</span>, I dismiss the accused’s submission on this point for two reasons. First, I do not think the examples of charitable work and public service cited are so compelling as to establish that the Amalgamated Cheating Offence (or the dishonest misappropriation offence) is a one-off aberration. My view remains unchanged even when considering the accused’s academic record (see [31(b)(ii)] above). Second, even if I am wrong, the public interest in generally deterring credit card-related cheating offences displaces the modest mitigatory weight which attaches to the accused’s record of charitable work and public service.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Third the accused argues that he has a positive employment record, even with the Company. However, an accused’s employment record is only mitigating if there is a “rational relationship” between the accused’s contributions as an exemplary employee and the seriousness of the offence committed against the employer (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Charan Singh</span> [2013] SGHC 115 (“<span class="font-italic">Charan Singh</span>”) at [35]). In <span class="font-italic">Charan Singh</span>, the offender’s contributions to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) as an employee were mitigating. This was because LTA was the <span class="font-italic">victim</span> of the offence under s 6(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed). The accused had knowingly used a materially false receipt intended by him to mislead LTA (see [35]). In contrast, in the present case, the Company is not the victim in any of the proceeded charges. The victims in the Amalgamated Cheating Offence are the Employees of the various retailers deceived by the accused into believing that he was the rightful holder of the Diners Card. The victim in the Dishonest Misappropriation Charge is the complainant. Consequently, I am unable to ascribe the accused’s good employment record any mitigating weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Fourth, I am not minded to further reduce the sentence imposed on account of the accused’s remorse. I note that the DJ found that “the accused was deeply remorseful – he had pleaded guilty, made full restitution and written to the victims to apologise”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 With regards the accused’s early plea of guilt, I have already taken this into account when arriving at the starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment above. I applied a four-month uplift from the range of four to eight months’ imprisonment set out in <span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn</span> by balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case with <span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn </span>itself, <span class="font-italic">Willie Tan v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> MA 359/93/01 and <span class="font-italic">Chew Im v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>MA 308/2000/01 (the latter two are unreported cases cited at [47] of <span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn</span>; see <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at pp 839 and 843). All these three cases involved offenders who pleaded guilty to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, s 417 Penal Code charges. In other words, by using these cases as benchmarks, I have already accounted for the mitigating value of the accused’s plea of guilt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 With regards the accused’s voluntary restitution, for reasons explained at [124] above, the 6 April 2020 email deprives it of substantial mitigating value. The same email also undermines the accused’s argument that his apology letters to the victims evidence genuine remorse. Whatever remorse is disclosed in these apologies or, for that matter, his voluntary undertaking of IMH treatment, is sufficiently reflected in the four-month downward adjustment from the starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Finally, the accused’s argument that he did not attempt to conceal himself and that the police found him easily is difficult to believe. After the Diners Card was declined at Cedele in HillV2, Singapore, the accused was careful enough to discard it.

</div> One possible inference is that the accused was cautious to avoid using the Diners Card to make payments which were easily traceable back to him. Further, while the complainant lodged a police report on 12 June 2019, the accused was only arrested and brought in for investigation on 2 July 2019.

In place, it imposes eight months’ imprisonment in respect of an amalgamated charge involving 103 incidents of cheating using a dishonestly misappropriated credit card. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-underline">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">•  An offence amalgamated under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) is a single offence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]–[52]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">•  On a purposive reading of ss 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC, where an accused person is convicted of a charge amalgamated under s 124(4), the word “offence” refers to the amalgamated offence, rather than the offences being amalgamated (“the base offence”). Therefore, if the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC exceeds three years’ imprisonment, the court is statutorily precluded by s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) from imposing community sentences under Part XVII of the CPC even if each base offence of the amalgamated charge is punishable with an imprisonment term of three years or less (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">97]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">•  The word “offence” in s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC must be interpreted in the same manner as s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC. Under s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), where an offence is punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, the offence must be identified in the Criminal Procedure Code (Prescribed Offences for Mandatory Treatment Orders) Regulations 2018 (S 747/2018) (“Prescribed Offences Regulations”) in order for a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) to be available. Since an amalgamated offence is distinct in law from its base offences, and the Prescribed Offences Regulations does not include offences amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC, amalgamated offences with a maximum imprisonment term exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC, are necessarily precluded from MTOs (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">98]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">•  The Prosecution must take extreme care when exercising their prosecutorial discretion to frame amalgamated charges so as not to inadvertently preclude a deserving offender from receiving a community sentence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">1 At the material time, the accused was a Digital Marketing Manager at AAM Advisory (“the Company”). The complainant was the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The complainant is the rightful holder of the Diners Club credit card (“the Diners Card”) involved in the offences committed by the accused.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 Sometime in May 2019, the accused chanced upon the Diners Card on the floor of a meeting room in the Company’s office. He dishonestly misappropriated the Diners Card despite knowing that it belonged to the complainant. This forms the basis of the s 403 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) offence in the first proceeded charge (“the Dishonest Misappropriation Charge”). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">3 Subsequently, from 4 May 2019 to 27 June 2019, the accused used the Diners Card to make purchases for himself, his wife and his family members. He presented the Diners Club to employees working at various sales outlets on 103 occasions (“the Employees”) to pay for a range of items including shoes, apparel, sunglasses and wellness packages (“the Items”). By doing so, the accused deceived the Employees into believing that he was the rightful holder of the Diners Card and induced the Employees to accept the Diners Card as payment for the Items. The Prosecution framed an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the CPC (“the Amalgamated Cheating Charge”). The Items have a total value of $20,642.48.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 Dr Lionel Lim Chee Chong (“Dr Lim”) and Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”) diagnosed the accused with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (“OCPD”) at the time of the offences. Dr Goh further diagnosed the accused as having suffered from a major depressive episode around the time of the offences. Dr Lim’s first report, and both of Dr Goh’s reports concluded that the accused’s mental disorder(s) contributed to the conduct of the offences.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 In the court below, the accused pleaded guilty to the Dishonest Misappropriation Charge and Amalgamated Cheating Charge. Two additional charges, an amalgamated cheating charge and an amalgamated attempted cheating charge, were taken-into-consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The District Judge (“DJ”) sentenced the accused to a community sentence comprising a short detention order (“SDO”) of ten days and an MTO for 24 months.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 The Prosecution filed an appeal on the grounds that the DJ erred in law by ruling that s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC did not preclude the imposition of community orders in respect of the Amalgamated Cheating Charge given that the offence therein is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds three years by virtue of s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC. Further, given that community orders were unavailable as a sentencing option, the DJ erred in law and in fact in concluding that a custodial sentence of imprisonment was not warranted. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 The accused subsequently filed a cross-appeal against the SDO on the grounds that its imposition was wrong in law and manifestly excessive. He took the view that the global sentence should only comprise the MTO. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 The High Court allowed the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. It imposed eight months’ imprisonment for the Amalgamated Cheating Charge, two months’ imprisonment for the Dishonest Misappropriation Charge and ordered both sentences to run concurrently. Accordingly, the accused’s cross-appeal was dismissed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Community sentences were not available in light of the Amalgamated Cheating Charge</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 Under the first step of purposive statutory interpretation, the plain meaning of “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC was wide enough to encompass an amalgamated offence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[44]</span>). This was because s 124(4), read with s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC, fulfilled the definition of “offence” in s 2(1) of the CPC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[45]</span>). It was also clear, from s 124(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 132 CPC, that an offence amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC was a single offence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[47]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[48]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 Other contextual clues indicated that “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC should refer to the amalgamated offence under s 124(4) CPC when such an amalgamated charge was framed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53]</span>). The references to the sentence of imprisonment in lieu of which a community order is imposed or which is subsequently resurrected for various reasons stipulated in ss 337(5), 337(6), 337(9), 352(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 354(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 354(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC, must refer to that imposed in light of s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">58]</span>). Bearing this in mind, the court saw no reason for the “term of imprisonment” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) to then refer to the court’s sentencing jurisdiction under the base offence, rather than s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). It followed that “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) must refer to the amalgamated offence if the proceeded charge is one amalgamated under <br>s 124(4) CPC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[58]</span>).</br></div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 Under the second step of purposive statutory interpretation, the court examined the legislative purposes of Part XVII and s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC. Community sentences in Part XVII of the CPC targeted offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[64]</span>). They enabled the courts to deliver the correct mix of deterrence, prevention, retribution and rehabilitation on the specific facts of each case (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[63]</span>). s 337, in turn, was intended to prevent offences or offenders which fell outside of the rehabilitation end of the spectrum from accessing the regime of community orders. s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC filtered out offences punishable with more than three years imprisonment. Such offences, in Parliament’s view, were not at the rehabilitation end of the spectrum and engaged the other three sentencing considerations of deterrence, prevention and retribution more strongly (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 With regards the legislative purpose of the device of amalgamation in s 124(4) of the CPC, the court held that s 124(4) CPC was not merely procedural in nature. Instead, amalgamation may be used to signal the higher criminality of the accused and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[69]</span>). This view was supported by the plain wording of s 124(4), as understood in the context of established sentencing principles (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[70]–[7</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>), and English authorities discussing a similar amalgamation procedure in the UK (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[77]–[82]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 The Prosecution must take extreme care when exercising their prosecutorial discretion to frame amalgamated charges so as not to inadvertently preclude a deserving offender from receiving a community sentence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>). This is because not in all cases will the overall criminality of an accused facing an amalgamated charge comprising X number of incidents be higher than the overall criminality of an accused facing X number of discrete charges for the same base offence. Put another way, it was conceptually possible for someone facing an amalgamated offence to still be deserving of a community sentence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[89]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">14 At the third step of purposive statutory interpretation, the court held that Parliamentary intention behind ss 124(4), 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC was best promoted by interpreting “offence” in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC as referring to the amalgamated offence, when the accused faced a s 124(4) CPC amalgamated charge (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[85]</span>). Therefore, if the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC exceeded three years’ imprisonment, the court was statutorily precluded by s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) from imposing community sentences under Part XVII of the CPC even if each base offence of the amalgamated charge was punishable with an imprisonment term of three years or less (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[97]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">15 The word “offence” in s 337(2)(c) CPC must be interpreted in the same manner as s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC. There was nothing to suggest that the position is otherwise. Under s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), where an offence was punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, the offence must be identified in the Prescribed Offences Regulations in order for an MTO to be available. Since an amalgamated offence was distinct in law from its base offences, and the Prescribed Offences Regulations did not include offences amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC, amalgamated offences with a maximum imprisonment term exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC, were necessarily precluded from MTOs (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[98]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">16 In this case, the maximum imprisonment term under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) CPC in respect of the Amalgamated Cheating Charge was six years. This exceeded the three year threshold in s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CPC, thus precluding the accused from a community sentence. The accused was also ineligible for an MTO as offences amalgamated under s 124(4) were not prescribed offences for the purposes of s 337(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) CPC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[99]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate sentence in this case</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">17 Given the court’s interpretation of s 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CPC, the accused’s cross-appeal failed as both an SDO and MTO were unavailable (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[100]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">18 With regards the sentence for the Amalgamated Cheating Charge, despite the contributory role of the accused’s two mental disorders, general and specific deterrence remained the dominant considerations (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[105]</span>). This was because, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the offence in the Amalgamated Cheating Charge was premeditated (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[107]</span>), the accused understood the legal and moral wrongfulness of his actions (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[110]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[112]</span>) and the accused offended for personal gain (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[113]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">19 Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Idya </span><span class="font-italic">Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2014] 1 SLR 756 (“<span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn</span>”) at [47] observed that custodial sentences of between four and eight months’ imprisonment were imposed for s 417 Penal Code offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000. Applying the guidance <span class="font-italic">Idya Nurhazlyn</span>, and having regard to the relevant circumstances in this case (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[122]–[124]</span>), at least 12 months’ imprisonment was justified before the mitigating impact of the accused’s mental disorders was considered (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">121]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> [125]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">20 From the initial position of 12 months’ imprisonment, the court adjusted the custodial sentence for the Amalgamated Cheating Charge downwards by four months to account for the contributory link between the accused’s mental disorders and the commission of the offence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[126]</span>). Finally, the court was not persuaded to reduce the custodial sentence any further in light of the offender-specific mitigating factors raised by the accused (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[127]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[137]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">21 With regards the Dishonest Misappropriation Charge, the court imposed two months’ imprisonment and ordered this to run concurrently with the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the Amalgamated Cheating Charge (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[138]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[139]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">22 For the reasons above, a global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was imposed.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
