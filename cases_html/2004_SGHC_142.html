</p>
<p class="Judg-Author" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">MPH Rubin J:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1          This registrar’s appeal concerns discovery of documents in an action commenced by the management corporation of a condominium against a developer. The background facts which surround the dispute between the parties are as follows.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2          The plaintiff, a management corporation constituted under the provisions of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed), represents 390 homeowners of a condominium known as Seasons Park. The defendant is the developer of Seasons Park and was responsible for its proper construction. The development of the project began in or around 1996 and the certificate of statutory completion was issued in or around 28 February 1998. In so far as is material under cl 9(1) of the sale and purchase agreement between the defendant and the purchasers of the units at Seasons Park, it was agreed by the defendant, as the developer/vendor, as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The Vendor shall as soon as possible build the unit together with all the common property of the Building and the Housing Project in a good and workmanlike manner according to the Specifications and the plans approved by the Building Authority and other authorities.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3          The plaintiff was duly constituted on or around 27 May 1999. The plaintiff’s first annual general meeting was convened on 24 June 2001 when the plaintiff took over from the defendant the control, management and administration of the common property of Seasons Park, for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4          Since or around the year 2000, several subsidiary proprietors had been complaining to the defendant of water ingress in the rooftops of the residential units and defects in elevators, windows, the car park, lift lobbies, the clubhouse, swimming pools, floors, walls, tennis courts and other areas of the common property. The defendant reportedly attempted to effect repairs to the property but the complaints persisted.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5          The plaintiff then commissioned a firm of building surveyors to study and review the problems at the development. The report submitted by the said surveyors concluded that the common property at the development had several defects and that the defendant’s various attempts at rectifying the defects in the rooftops and the elevators had been unsuccessful. A further report by the surveyors also said that there was rainwater ingress in a substantial number of the residential units.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6          Consequently, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant for breach of duty as well as for breach of the sale and purchase agreement and breach of an implied contract.</span><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">The main complaint of the plaintiff, as set out in the statement of claim, is as follows:</span><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[2]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">38.        From the very beginning, the Plaintiffs have not enjoyed the benefit of having and/or enjoying properly plastered and painted elevations and leak-free buildings. The stained elevations are an eyesore and diminished the value of the Development. The Defendants are not keen to find a permanent solution to all the problems, and are only prepared to do cheap short-terms patch repairs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">39.        The Defendants are and were in breach of their duty owed to the Plaintiffs to construct and deliver the Development in a good workmanlike manner, which breach caused damage and will cause loss to the Plaintiffs.</span></p>

The Defendants aver that they did not undertake the design and construction of the Development. The design of the Development and supervision of construction works were undertaken by professional independent consultants engaged by the Defendants while an independent Main Contractor engaged by the Defendants undertook the construction and building works of the Development.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19.        Further, the Defendants aver that, even if paragraph 29 of the Statement of Claim is true (which is denied), the Defendants aver that they had delegated the construction of the Development to Poh Lian Construction Pte Ltd (“the Main Contractor”) who are an independent contractor. In the circumstances, the Defendants are not vicariously liable for the defaults of the Main Contractor (if any) and/or have discharged their duty of care by delegation to a reasonably competent independent contractor.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20.        Further and/or alternatively, the Defendants aver that even if paragraph 29 of the Statement of Claim is true (which is denied), Architects 61 (“the Architects”) were the firm of architects appointed by the Defendants for the Development and that the Architects accepted such employment as architects to design and/or supervise the construction works on the Development. In the circumstances, the Defendants are not vicariously liable for the defaults of the Architects (if any) and/or have discharged their duty of care by delegation of the design and/or supervision for the construction of the Development to a reasonably competent independent consultant.</span></p>

<p align="center" class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(1)        The Defendants did not design the Development nor did the Defendants supervise the construction works for the Development. The Defendants engaged professional consultants to undertake the design of the Development and the supervision of the construction of the Development in accordance with the sales specifications and the approved building plans and in compliance with statutory requirements.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2)        The Defendants did not carry out the construction works for the Development. The Defendants engaged a reputable Main Contractor to carry out the construction of the Development.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25.        Further or in the alternative, the Defendants aver that they had relied on the Architects to provide a proper design for the Development and to provide proper supervision of the construction works and had relied on the Main Contractor to provide good workmanship in carrying out the building and construction works. If there is any duty owed to the Plaintiff in respect of design and construction, such duty had been delegated to an independent consultant and independent contractor respectively, and the Defendants are not liable for any damage and/or loss caused or occasioned by a breach of duty on the part of the independent consultant and independent contractor respectively.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8          There ensued the discovery process and in the event, there was an order by the assistant registrar on 15 March 2004 granting discovery of some ten items including architectural, structural, and mechanical and electrical (M&amp;E) drawings (“contract drawings”) and original specifications of the contracts relating to the construction of the development (“contract specification”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9          The defendant appealed against the said order in relation to most of the discovery items. I heard the appeal on 21 April 2004. While the appeal was in train, the court was informed that the parties had come to an amicable arrangement in respect of a number of items forming the subject matter of the notice of appeal. Only the contract drawings and contract specifications were left for determination. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the defendant’s appeal on the grounds that the said documents appeared relevant to the proper determination of the issues at hand. On 28 April 2004, the defendant wrote to the court requesting further arguments to be presented and these arguments were heard by me on 28 June 2004.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10        The main thrust of the defendant’s arguments appear in the defendant’s solicitors’ letter dated 28 April 2004. The relevant parts read as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4.         The Respondents have founded their action in Suit No. 827 of 2003/B in contract and in tort.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.         In contract, the Respondents have relied on Clause 9(1) of the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement and/or implied contract of the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement. Alternatively, the Respondents have alleged that there was an implied contract between the Appellants and themselves arising out of the acknowledgement by the Appellants of the obligation to undertake appropriate repairs to the Development and that the Appellants effected such repairs on diverse dates in or around 2000 or thereabouts in consideration of forbearance to sue.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6.         The Appellants submit that in the local case of <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd and another appeal</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 113</nobr> where there was an argument raised by the MCST on whether they could find an action in contract, the MCST relied similarly on the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement and no other main contract or other documents. The Appellants submit that the Respondents are similarly pursuing the claim in contract based on the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement and should likewise be confined to the same. What is glaringly obvious from the case of <i>RSP Architects</i> is the omission of reference to the main contract drawings and specifications in the trial.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7.         Further, the Respondents have alleged that the Appellants have been negligent in the construction of the Development in tort. The Respondents are relying on the breaches of normal industry standards and/or the Singapore Construction Industry Development Board’s Quality Assessment System (“CONQUAS”) and/or British Standards.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8.         The Appellants contend that based on the Respondents’ own pleaded case above, the contract documents and drawings are irrelevant in advancing the Respondents’ case. Further, the Appellants submit that it is clear from and accepted in the <i>Ocean Front</i> case and the case of <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers (Raglan Squire &amp; Partners FE) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1075</i> <i>and Another</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 449</nobr> (“<i>Eastern Lagoon II</i>”) that in determining whether there is negligence on the part of developer in respect of alleged building defects, the benchmark for deciding liability would be the acceptable practices in the industry and whether the relevant codes of practice or standards have been observed. In this regard, the Appellants refer to paragraph 49 of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Eastern Lagoon II</i> where it was stated that: “<i>It was common ground before the learned judge that the building industry follows the British Codes of Practice</i> …”. The Court of Appeal and the Judge below had gone on to consider the non-compliance with the codes in determining negligence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9.         Further, the standards and specifications relied on by the Respondents in pursuing the case against the Appellants are clearly set out in the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement, which the Respondents are relying on in their pleadings. The Appellants contend and submit that the First Schedule of the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement contains the specifications of the buildings in the Development, and also sets out the required building standards. Further, clause 14 of the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement contemplates changes from specifications and plans, if any.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11        The principles as regards discovery were redefined by the Court of Appeal in <i>Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2002] 3 SLR 345</nobr> where Chao Hick Tin JA, in delivering the opinion of the court, said at [15] to [19]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The criteria adopted by the new rules are more specific. They are set out in O 24 r 1(2):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The documents which a party to a cause or matter may be ordered to discover under paragraph (1) are as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)        the documents on which the party relies or will rely; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)        the documents which could —</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i)         adversely affect his own case;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)        adversely affect another party’s case; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(iii)       support another party’s case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">There is, in addition, an overriding principle prescribed in r 7, which is, that the discovery must be “necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Documents which are now discoverable, other than those on which a party relies or will rely (r 1(2)(a)), will be those which could (1) adversely affect the party’s own case; (2) adversely affect another party’s case; or (3) support another party’s case. It should be noted that the word there is “could” not “would”. So a document which has the “potential of affecting” the party from whom the document is requested, is obliged to discover the same.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Thus caution must be exercised when considering decisions which were made under the previous rules because, in the words of Jeffrey Pinsler on <i>Singapore Court Practice</i> O 24, “a document is no longer discoverable merely because there is some connection (irrespective of the nature of the link) between it and the issue in the case”. Documents which were required to be discovered under the concept of “train of inquiry” are no longer discoverable under the present O 24 r 1. However, this is not to say that the concept of “train of inquiry” has been removed from the Rules. It has reappeared in r 5 which relates to discovery of specific documents.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">However, it must not thereby be taken that cases decided under the previous rules are no longer pertinent. As was the position under the previous rules, one of the essential preconditions to be satisfied before discovery will be ordered is that of “relevance”. Whether a document would affect that party’s claim, or adversely affect another party’s case, or support another party’s case, must depend on the issues pleaded in the action. The cases that shed light on “relevancy” are just as useful today.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Some of the principles on “relevancy” established by the cases are the following. In [<i>Thorpe v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police</i> [1989] 2 All ER 827] it was decided that a document was not discoverable if it was to be used only for the purpose of cross-examination to establish credibility of witnesses. A discovered document can also be blanked out in part if the blanked out portion is irrelevant to the issues of the action: <i>GE Capital Corporate Finance Group v Bankers Trust Co</i> [1995] 2 All ER 993; <nobr>[1995] 1 WLR 172</nobr>. The discovery process should not be allowed to “fish” a cause of action: see <i>Wright Norman v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 710</nobr>. Where an allegation is not pleaded, seeking discovery of a document to back up such an allegation constitutes fishing: <i>Marks &amp; Spencer plc v Granada TV</i> (unreported, 8 April 1997).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12        Returning to the issues before the court, the defendant’s contention was that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the test of relevancy as regards the contract drawings and contract specifications. In a nutshell, what the defendant seemed to be contending was that (a) in relation to the plaintiff’s claim based on contract, it should confine itself only to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement and (b) in relation to the claim founded on tort, it should restrict itself to breaches of normal industry standards and/or the Singapore Construction Industry Development Board’s Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) and/or British Standards.</span><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[4]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13        The plaintiff’s claim based on breach of duty bespeaks many alleged lapses.</span><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[5]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">The said lapses include, amongst other things, (a) failure to issue the necessary instructions or directions to the contractor or sub-contractor or architects on the matters in relation to or affecting the development</span><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[6]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">; (b) failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in relation to the design and supervision of the construction of the development so as to avoid loss and damage</span><a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[7]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">and (c) failure to superintend the construction of the said works properly or at all.</span><a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[8]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14        Relevant evidence simply means such evidence as bears directly upon the point or fact in issue. Relevancy is that which conduces to the proof of a pertinent hypothesis. A fact or document is said to be relevant when it is so connected directly or indirectly with a fact in issue in an action that evidence given respecting it, may reasonably be expected to assist in proving or disproving the fact in issue (see <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> (6th Ed, 1990) pp 1290–1291 and Earl Jowitt, <i>The Dictionary of English Law</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd, 1959)).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15        Order 24 r 1(2) employs the auxiliary verb “could” before the words “adversely affect another party’s case”. In <i>Webster’s New World Dictionary of the English Language</i> (2nd College Ed, 1980), the word “could” is defined as:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">… generally equivalent to <i>can</i> in meaning and use, expressing especially a shadow of doubt or a smaller degree of ability or possibility … and suggesting politely less certainty than <i>can</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In my opinion, the use of the word “could” connotes that the court, in arriving at a decision whether a particular document is relevant or not, need not at this stage of the trial process enter upon an in-depth analysis as to the exact degree of relevance apropos the documents. What is required of the court at this stage of the trial is only to form an informed view as to whether the documents in question may reasonably be expected to assist in proving or disproving the fact in issue.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16        In returning to the appeal before me, the defendant’s contention that contract drawings and contract specifications do not relate to or bear directly upon the issue of the alleged breach of duty as well as implied obligations, is an over-simplification of the facts in issue. The defendant’s counsel contended before the assistant registrar</span><a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[9]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">that the documents under reference had no relevance to the plaintiff’s pleaded case and if at all, these concerned an issue between the architects’ main contractor and the defendant. This position also features in the defence filed by the defendant.</span><a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[10]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">If what the defendant contends was accurate, then those documents, perforce, become relevant for the very purpose of the defendant’s averments. Having pleaded that its architects designed the development and its contractors carried out the specifications, it does not now lie in the mouth of the defendant to claim that contract drawings and contract specifications are irrelevant to the issues to be determined at the trial. I must at this juncture, hasten to add a rider that my determination as to the relevancy of the documents in question does not touch upon the issue as to admissibility of the said documents at the trial.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17        In my view, the contract drawings as well as the contract specifications appear <i>prima facie</i> relevant to the determination of the issues at hand. As I said earlier, the court at this stage is not required to undertake a full scale inquiry into the area of relevancy. So long as the applying party satisfies the court that the documents requested may reasonably affect another party’s case adversely, it should not be prevented from discovering those documents.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18        As I was satisfied that the documents requested are relevant within the ambit of O 24 r 1(2), I dismissed the defendant’s appeal with costs and reaffirmed the decision of the assistant registrar.</span></p>
