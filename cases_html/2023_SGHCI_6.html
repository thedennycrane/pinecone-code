by a software licencing agreement. Subsequently, the two co-owners and the licensee executed a supplementary agreement by which the second co-owner was added as a co-licensor under the software licensing agreement. The first co-owner thereafter acted on behalf of the second co-owner. In time, the second co-owner had concerns about the licensee’s conduct and commenced an arbitration under the arbitration clause in that agreement. Shortly after it did so, the first co-owner, who by then was a subsidiary of the licensee, entered into an extension agreement to extend the term of the licence with the licensee, purportedly acting under the same source of authority originally granted by the second co-owner so as to bind it. In addition to extending the term of the licence, the extension agreement provided for a different seat and different institution for any arbitration. Both the licensee and the first co-owner thereafter objected to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal on the ground that the parties’ entry into the new arbitration agreement by the extension agreement had put an end to its jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal rejected this objection on the basis that the new arbitration agreement had been made in breach of the first co-owner’s fiduciary duty to the second co-owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Upon challenge of the award to this court, our task is to determine for ourselves whether the arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction. This task involves considering whether the first co-owner’s authority is governed by Korean law or by Singapore law and, depending on the governing law, what duties if any the first co-owner owed to the second co-owner when purportedly agreeing on its behalf to change the arbitral seat and institution after the latter had commenced arbitration against the licensee at the originally agreed seat and institution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This consolidated set of originating summonses comprises applications to set aside the partial award on liability (the “First Partial Award” and the award on costs arising from the findings made in the First Partial Award, the “Second Partial Award”, collectively with the First Partial Award, the “Partial Awards”) issued by a three-member arbitral tribunal in an arbitration commenced under the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) Arbitration Rules 2017 (“ICC Rules”) and seated in Singapore in ICC Arbitration Case No. 22820/PTA/HTG (the “Present Arbitration”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The asserted ground for setting aside is that the tribunal in the Present Arbitration (the “Tribunal”) lacked jurisdiction over the entire dispute because the ICC Clause (see [22] below) pursuant to which the Present Arbitration had been commenced was superseded on 30 June 2017 by the Shanghai International Arbitration Centre (“SHIAC”) Clause in the 2017 Extension Agreement (see [43] below), thus terminating the mandate of the Tribunal. The Tribunal rejected this argument on the basis that the entry into the 2017 Extension Agreement by CNA had happened in breach of fiduciary duty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In SIC/OS 2/2022 and SIC/OS 5/2022, the plaintiff bringing the setting aside applications against the Partial Awards is CNA.

</div> Under the SLA, CNE was granted the sole and exclusive licence to “use, promote, distribute, market, adapt or modify, and convert the Chinese-language version of the [computer game [X2] delivered in CD-ROM and internet and related documentation, images and films, published specifications and trademark, logo and artwork related to the game series]”. The licence was valid for a minimum of two years and would automatically extend for a further term of one year unless either party sent a written notice to the other stating that it did not want to renew the SLA within 60 days prior to its expiration. In return, CNE agreed to pay a non-refundable licensing fee of US$300,000 upon signing the SLA and a monthly royalty fee in the amount of 27% of the revenue from sales of the game [X2]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Clause 8.04 of the SLA contained a Singapore-law governing law clause and provided for an ICC arbitration in Singapore (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">ICC Clause</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement shall be governed and construed by in accordance with the laws of Singapore.

The arbitration shall be held in Singapore in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Following the SLA, the Chinese-language version of the game [X2] was launched around late 2001 in the PRC to resounding success. By 2002, the game [X2] accounted for 60% of the online game market in the PRC. It remains one of the most popular MMORPG in the PRC.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">2002 Supplementary Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Following the success of the game [X2], in or around December 2001, bugs and cheating programs started to interfere with its operation. CNE approached CNA to seek assistance to resolve the technical issues pursuant to cl 5.04 of the SLA, which provided that throughout the term of the SLA, the “Licensor” was responsible for providing technical services in connection with the installation and on-site maintenance of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the computer game [X2].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, CNA was unable to assist as it relied on CNB to resolve technical issues pursuant to the cooperative arrangements between CNA and CNB where CNB was responsible for the day-to-day servicing of the game [X2]. CNB was not a signatory to the SLA. CNE was displeased to learn that while it was contractually entitled to technical support from the “Licensor” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CNA under the SLA), CNA relied on CNB to fulfil this obligation. CNE also alleged that CNA had materially misrepresented its status as the sole owner of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the computer game [X2], licensed under the SLA. In light of this development, discussions ensued between the parties concerning how to resolve the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On 14 July 2002, CNA, CNB and CNE entered into a Supplementary Agreement to the SLA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 2002 Supplementary Agreement), which detailed CNB’s obligation, as co-licensor, to CNE to resolve technical problems that might affect the servicing and normal operation of the computer game [X2] in the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the preamble to the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, it was provided that the SLA would remain effective until 28 September 2003 and CNB would “perform relevant obligations in respect of the technical support”. It further stated that “[CNA] and [CNE] have agreed to accept [CNB] as [the game [X2]]’s co-Licensor, and [CNB] will entrust [CNA] with the exercise of all its rights as co-Licensor, and the entrustment is irrevocable during the term of the [SLA] and [the 2002] Supplementary Agreement” (the “Entrustment Recitation”). The Supplementary Agreement therefore introduced CNB as a co-licensor to provide technical support for the computer game [X2], but its rights as co-licensor were to be entrusted to CNA so that CNE could continue dealing only with CNA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The terms of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement related to CNE’s rights to the upgraded version of the game [X2], CNE’s payment of the royalties it had withheld, and CNB’s obligations to CNE to solve technical problems that may affect the otherwise normal operation of the game in an active manner in accordance with the SLA and the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. Clause 8 of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement stated that the conclusion of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement did not in any way affect the validity of any clause in the SLA nor the lawful acquisition of any rights that the parties to the SLA were entitled to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The disputes between CNA, CNB and CNE continued despite the signing of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. These included concerns about persistent bugs and cheating programs which affected the operation of the game [X2], and the leak of the source code of the game [X2]. Consequently, CNE elected to stop paying royalties. In turn, CNA sent notice of termination of the SLA and the 2002 Supplementary Agreement to CNE on the basis of non-payment of royalties. CNE denied the effectiveness of the termination. CNB, on the other hand, wrote to CNA, stating that it did not have any intention to maintain the SLA and the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. CNB also informed CNA that it should not withdraw its notice of termination or renew the SLA. This precipitated an arbitration commenced by CNE against CNA and CNB pursuant to the ICC Clause in the SLA (the “2003 ICC Arbitration”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">2004 Settlement Record </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Between 2003 and 2004, multiple proceedings in the Korean courts were brought by CNA and CNB against each other.

On the back of the change in market trends, the parties began negotiating an arrangement to exploit the mobile version of the game [X2].

Instead, these authorisation letters were used to grant “sub-licences” for the game [X2] PC-client, web and mobile games. This was in breach of CNE’s limited licence under the SLA, which CND / CNE acknowledged in early 2015 to mid-2016. Pursuant to the concession, CND / CNE agreed to inform CNB of all the “sub-licences” which had been granted, and to remit the profits made to CNB and CNC.

Unfortunately, the concessionary promises made by CND / CNE were not kept. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 CNA and CNB diverged in their responses to this. In or around August 2016, CNA issued an authorisation letter for CND and CNE covering the period of 29 September 2015 to 28 September 2017 (the “2016 Authorisation Letter”). The 2016 Authorisation Letter purported to give CND and CNE the rights to “compile and permit use by third party” and “transfer and sub-authorize all rights under this contract to a third party”. This departed from the content of the previous authorisation letters, which had been to facilitate the prosecution of infringing activities. Conversely, in light of these alleged transgressions, over the period of January to April 2017, CNB had expressed its unhappiness to CNA through letters detailing CND and CNE’s breaches of the SLA and its continued failure to take any corrective actions. CNA either remained silent in the face of the correspondence or requested CNB to produce evidence of these alleged breaches by CND or CNE. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 CNB commenced the Present Arbitration on 18 May 2017 against CND and CNE for their breaches of the SLA.

The tribunal held that the 2002 Supplementary Agreement primarily regulated “the licensing arrangements by both [CNA] and [CNB] (as one interest bloc) with [CNE]” (at [123]).

The gist of the case mounted by the respondents in the Present Arbitration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CNA, CND and CNE) was that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the SLA was breached because the ICC Clause, which formed the basis of its jurisdiction, had been terminated, replaced and/or superseded by the SHIAC Clause in the 2017 Extension Agreement. In defence of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, CNB / CNC argued that the 2017 Extension Agreement was void or invalid because it was executed by CNA in breach of its fiduciary duties owed to CNB / CNC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As to liability on the merits, CNB / CNC claimed that CND and CNE breached the SLA by authorising and/or facilitating third parties to develop and exploit unauthorised web, mobile and PC-client versions of the game [X2]. This claim was premised on the limited scope of the SLA, which conferred on CND only the right to use, promote or distribute the game [X2] in PC-client format and to sub-license to six permitted sub-licensees. Against CNA, CNB / CNC alleged that it had procured or induced and/or actively assisted CND and CNE in their breaches of the SLA. CNB / CNC also claimed that CNA, CND and CNE conspired to injure by unlawful means in amending the dispute resolution and governing law clause via the 2017 Extension Agreement and by procuring the SHIAC award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Tribunal’s decision in the Present Arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 On 8 June 2020, the Tribunal issued the First Partial Award on liability. The findings in the First Partial Award are summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 2017 Extension Agreement was invalid. As the source of CNA’s authority to renew or extend the SLA arose from the Entrustment Recitation in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement which was governed by Singapore law, CNA was an agent of CNB/CNC and owed fiduciary duties to them in the exercise of their rights as co-licensors to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, act in the joint interests of itself and CNB/CNC and act in good faith and with due diligence (at [181]). The Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine if CNA owed and breached fiduciary duties and/or the duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record because there was a close connection to the SLA and the ICC Clause ought to be interpreted widely (at [196]). CNA breached its fiduciary duties and its duty to consult (at [215]–[218] and [230]–[232]). Thus, CNB / CNC were not bound by CNA’s renewal of the SLA and the 2017 Extension Agreement was voidable (at [239]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The scope of the SLA covered only the PC-client version of the game [X2], and CND and CNE had breached the SLA (at [355]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) CNA had procured, induced or assisted CND and CNE in their breaches of the SLA by unilaterally issuing the authorisation letters in 2016 and 2017, and colluding with them with respect to the execution of the 2017 Extension Agreement (at [551]–[564]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) CNA, CND and CNE were also found liable for unlawfully conspiring to injure CNB / CNC by amending the dispute resolution and governing law clause via the 2017 Extension Agreement (at [565]–[596]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On 31 July 2021, the Tribunal issued the Second Partial Award. CNB / CNC was awarded US$2.79m for legal costs and expenses in the liability phase and US$381,622 for the interim relief applications. These proceedings are presently at the quantum phase.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history of these proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">SIC/OS 2/2022 and SIC/OS 5/2022</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 On 18 December 2020, CNA filed HC/OS 1293/2020 (later SIC/OS 2/2022) (“OS 2”).

This finding concerned a matter that had been disputed and subsequently settled in the PRC courts, meaning that there was no longer any dispute as to whether the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2], and in any event that matter would be governed by the separate settlement agreement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine the allegations against CND and CNE relating to mobile games (as opposed to other formats such as PC-client or web games). Those were disputes arising out of or relating to separate licensing agreements that were specific to mobile games and contained their own arbitration clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for the Second Partial Award, if the First Partial Award is set aside in its entirety, CND and CNE submit that it follows that the Second Partial Award be set aside in its entirety. In the event the First Partial Award is partially set aside, then similarly the Second Partial Award should be set aside in part because an award based on illegitimate considerations is flawed and cannot in fairness stand.

</div>
</div> In respect of the argument that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine the claims filed after the 2017 Extension Agreement was concluded, CNB and CNC contend that this is circular reasoning. The more fundamental question, in their opinion, is whether the Tribunal’s jurisdiction could be ousted by the 2017 Extension Agreement after the Present Arbitration had commenced. As for whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the allegations that the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2], CNB and CNC argue that the settlement agreement in the PRC Courts in 2007 did not have the effect of preventing this determination and that this finding was made because of CND and CNE’s defence that the games CNB / CNC sought to assert its IP rights over were based on the game [Y]. The rebuttal to the allegation that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to determine issues relating to mobile games is that the SLA contained an implied term that CND and CNE would not exceed the scope of their licence, which is the game [X2] PC-client game.

</div> At the time, the existing SLA was due to expire on 28 September 2017. Yet, the process to negotiate and conclude the 2017 Extension Agreement between CNA and CND / CNE was prompted by CNB and CNC’s application for an injunction to prohibit the extension of the SLA in the Seoul Central District Court on 27 June 2017. On 30 June 2017, Mr M of CND and CNE sent CNA a draft of the 2017 Extension Agreement that adopted the same structure as the 2008 Extension Agreement.

</div> In contradistinction, the defendants allude to there being impropriety in the manner in which CNA renewed the SLA – in breach of its fiduciary duties and its duty to consult the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In our view, CNA entered into the 2017 Extension Agreement knowing full well that CNB did not want it renewed, at least not until its concerns about past breaches and the scope of the licence were resolved, as demonstrated by CNB’s application for an injunction which CNA, CND and CNE knew of. CNA chose not to consult CNB on the terms of the renewal precisely because CNA knew of CNB’s concerns and objections to the renewal. This knowledge and motivation are apparent from the contemporaneous documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Moreover, on a balance of probabilities, we draw inferences that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  CND and CNE requested the change in the arbitration agreement during the extension it had obtained to file its Answer so that it could include that change in its Answer as the basis for objecting to jurisdiction.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) CNA agreed to this request not because of any objective assessment that SHIAC arbitration in the PRC was preferable to ICC arbitration in Singapore but because this was what CND and CNE wanted in order to object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) CNA was prepared to take into account CND / CNE’s interests, rather than only those of the co-licensors. The drawing of this inference is fortified by the fact that CNA was by this time a subsidiary of CNE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 CNA used its power to alter CNB’s legal relations with CND / CNE to benefit CND / CNE and did so knowing this was against CNB’s wishes and for that reason did not consult CNB before agreeing to the alteration. That it requested and obtained a substantial increase in the licensing fees as the price of this change in governing law, seat and arbitral institution shows that CNA understood that the change was no mere formality but something that CND / CNE very much desired and wanted urgently. It is also a reasonable inference to draw on a balance of probabilities that CNA understood that the detriment of this change would fall on CNB, which was in dispute with CND / CNE, rather than itself, as its conduct thus far showed that it had no appetite for a dispute with CND / CNE over alleged breaches of the SLA and because, by this time, CNE was the (indirect) owner of 51.06% of the shares in CNA.

</div> CNB’s allegation that the 2017 Extension Agreement was invalid must be heard by a tribunal appointed under its dispute resolution clause, namely by the SHIAC. Flowing from the principle of separability, CND and CNE contend that unless the arbitration agreement itself is independently void or invalid, the parties will be presumed to have intended the question of whether there was a concluded main agreement to be decided by arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement contained therein.

In <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span>, Lord Hoffmann explained that the arbitration agreement must be treated as a “distinct agreement” which is void or voidable only on grounds which relate directly to the arbitration agreement, and if the allegation is that the agent exceeded his authority by entering into a main agreement in terms which were not authorised or for improper reasons, that is not necessarily an attack on the arbitration agreement – rather, it must be shown that irrespective of the terms in the main agreement or the reasons for which the agent concluded it, he would have no authority to enter into an arbitration agreement (at [17]–[19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The defendants on the other hand argue that the entirety of the 2017 Extension Agreement, <span class="font-italic">including</span> the SHIAC Clause, is invalid.

The defendants posit that where there is a dispute over whether an agreement or a clause in it has been validly terminated or amended by a variation agreement entered into by one party on behalf of both itself and the other party, the original dispute resolution clause must govern this dispute. Otherwise, the party who purports to vary a contract relying on what it anticipates will be a contested authority will be encouraged to include in the attempted variation agreement a dispute resolution clause that is more favourable to it (regardless of the validity of the variation agreement) in order to displace an existing and valid dispute resolution clause.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 At the hearing before us, counsel for the plaintiffs contended that it was up to parties to exercise their choice of forum and governing law as arbitration is built on consent and party autonomy. We noted that this perhaps begged the question of whose consent and whose autonomy, given that the governing law and forum were purportedly changed after an arbitration was filed under the original dispute resolution clause and knowing that CNB objected to any extension and would undoubtedly object to the change to the dispute resolution clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Moreover, while CNB contends that the entire 2017 Extension Agreement is invalid or voidable, it also proffers separate and distinct reasons to show that the change in the dispute resolution clause was made for CND / CNE’s benefit, namely to put an end to the Present Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 This brings the discussion to the more fundamental reason why the doctrine of separability does not have the effect contended for by CND / CNE. This is that the issue before the Tribunal (and before this court) is whether CND / CNE had by entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement effectively terminated the mandate of the Tribunal notwithstanding that the Present Arbitration was validly commenced pursuant to the ICC Clause. CND / CNE contended that the Tribunal’s mandate had come to an end even though the party who had invoked arbitration pursuant to the ICC Clause (namely CNB) contended otherwise and wanted the arbitration to proceed. It is helpful to reproduce the jurisdictional objection made:

The answer to the question of which document conferred on CNA its authority to act on behalf of CNB affects the applicable law that determines whether CNA had the authority to execute the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB and consequently, whether it is valid and binding on CNB.

On a proper understanding of the Korean text of the Overseas Agreement, the translation “commission for sales entrustment” was not an accurate translation. Consequently, the translations provided by CNA in the present proceedings should be disregarded as inaccurate and belated. In the context of the history of agreements, the entrustment of CNB’s rights as co-licensor in the SLA only arose in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. Further, assuming that there were any entrustment under the Overseas Agreement, this would have been superseded by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement.

There were two translations proffered at the 2003 ICC Arbitration, the first translation and another one (see [19]), but it does not appear that this was the second translation as the title recorded at [121] of the Award is different even though the wording of the translation of Article 11 at [98] is consistent.

</div> We therefore prefer the language used in the first translation certified on 20 October 2003.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Accordingly, in the next section, we turn to the substance of the parties’ contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Analysis of the contractual agreements between parties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Locating the source of CNA’s authority requires examining the contractual agreements against the backdrop of the relationship between CNA and CNB as co-owners of the copyright. Based on the submissions on Korean law by the plaintiffs’ Korean law experts and the defendant’s Korean law expert in these proceedings, we find that the Korean law experts agree, in principle, to the extent of the following:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Article 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) adopts the unanimous agreement system and requires all joint copyright owners’ agreement for exercising the economic rights in a jointly-owned copyright (such as extending a licence to use a jointly-owned copyright to a third party).  If any one of the joint owners does not grant such agreement, it is not legally possible for any one of the joint owners to exercise the economic rights in the subject jointly-owned copyright.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) This unanimous agreement system does not require all joint owners to jointly exercise (either directly as a principal or through an agent) the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright, whereby all joint owners become parties to a contract exercising such economic rights (such as, for example, becoming co-licensors under a licence agreement with a third party), but it requires each joint owner’s consent with respect to any other co-licensor exercising such economic rights.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Accordingly, under this unanimous agreement system, in order for one of the joint owners to execute a contract exercising the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright, it is not necessary or required for the other joint owners to entrust the other joint owner with the authority to execute such contracts on behalf of the other joint owners, but consent to exercising the economic rights in the subject jointly-owned copyright is required to be granted by every joint owner. Conceptually, a mere consent in this sense does not mean, in and of itself, entrustment.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) If all joint owners grant their respective consent, any one of the joint owners is legally able to exercise the economic right in the jointly-owned copyright independently and unilaterally from the other joint owners under the unanimous agreement system.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) In practice, it is possible for all joint owners to enter into a contract agreeing on the terms and conditions on how to exercise the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright, and if such contract is entered into, the terms and conditions of such contract shall supersede Art 48(1).  It is legally possible for the joint owners to agree in such a contract that each joint owner gives its consent to exercising the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright subject to the agreed specific terms and conditions on how to exercise the economic rights.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127  Turning to the Overseas Agreement (as clarified by the later agreement defining the terms therein), based on the submissions before us, we find that the Korean law experts agree at least to the extent that the Overseas Agreement and other related agreements provide for the terms and conditions on how to exercise the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright over the game [X2]. Further, we find that the intention underlying the Oversees Agreement was that CNA and CNB consented to the other having the right independently to extend licences to third parties in respect of the territory outside of Korea, subject to the terms and conditions in the Overseas Agreement. The text of the Overseas Agreement does not support the interpretation put forth by CNA that it provides for the entrustment of CNA with the authority to execute licence agreements with third parties outside of Korea on behalf of CNB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Following the execution of the Overseas Agreement, CNA granted a licence to CNE and a third party under the SLA, with implicit consent from CNB. Based on our review of the contents of the Overseas Agreement as well as the surrounding context, we noted that (a) the Overseas Agreement does not contain any text indicating that CNB entrusted CNA the authority to execute licensing agreements with third parties; and (b) the licensing agreements executed by either CNA or CNB following the Overseas Agreement were executed unilaterally by CNA or CNB, as the case may be, and independently from the other. It can be reasonably inferred that the implicit consent granted by either CNA or CNB under the Overseas Agreement to the other could not, on its own, elevate the party granting such consent to a contractual party to the licence agreement executed by either CNB or CNA pursuant to the Overseas Agreement.  Based on the foregoing, we find that the Overseas Agreement and other related agreements should be interpreted to reflect a mutual consent to either CNA or CNB proceeding separately to grant licences, on its own, outside Korea independently and unilaterally from the other, and where either CNA or CNB had granted consent under the Overseas Agreement, the grantor of the consent is not bound by the licence agreement executed by the grantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The facts leading up to the execution of the SLA and the subsequent execution of the tripartite 2002 Supplementary Agreement further reinforce this finding. Under the SLA, CNA owes a contractual obligation to CNE to provide certain technical assistance, such as technical services in connection with installation and maintenance and programming services to correct defects. As it turned out, CNE became aware that CNA was not capable of performing such technical obligations by itself, and requested CNA to resolve this problem. This prompted the introduction of the tripartite 2002 Supplementary Agreement, where CNB was added as a party to the SLA with such technical obligations owed directly to CNE. The 2002 Supplementary Agreement’s recital on this point reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whereas [CNE] is entitled to have relevant technical support in the course of the [SLA], and [CNA] proposed to engage [CNB], and [CNB] is willing to accept the proposed engagement, to perform relevant obligations in respect of the technical support. [CNA] and [CNE] have agreed to accept [CNB] as [the game [X]]’s co-Licensor, and [CNB] will entrust [CNA] with the exercise of all its rights as co-Licensor, and the entrustment is irrevocable during the term of the [SLA] and this Supplementary Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 On its face, the recital indicates that the purpose of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement is twofold, namely, (a) to impose on CNB, as a party to the SLA as amended by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, the contractual obligation thereunder to provide technical support to CNE, with this obligation being one that is owed directly to CNE; and (b) to effect CNB’s entrustment of its rights as co-licensor to CNA. The operative provisions in the body of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement include specific clauses concerning the carrying out of the desired technical support by CNB but there is no further mention of entrustment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It is worth recalling that the 2002 Supplementary Agreement is written in the Chinese language. It was drafted by the in-house lawyer of CNE. When approaching the interpretation of an agreement, the formality of the agreement as well as the frame of reference of the draftsman are relevant. In this case, the fact that it was not written in the English language by a common lawyer may be material to answering the question of why the entrustment appeared only in the recital and not in the body of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 With this in mind, we return to the contentions of the plaintiffs. They contend that as CNA and CNB are Korean parties, they would define their relationship in Korean agreements (later, the 2004 Settlement Record) governed by Korean law. Further, the plaintiffs contend that a recital is not ordinarily to be treated as imposing substantive rights and obligations. As a matter of drafting practice, such substantive rights and obligations should appear in the body of the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The first difficulty with the plaintiffs’ contentions is that neither the Korean agreements nor the 2004 Settlement Record contain any language of entrustment of co-licensor’s rights. The word “weeim” is not used. Whilst the English word “entrustment” is used in the second translation of the Domestic and Overseas Agreements, we cannot accept on the evidence that this is a proper translation of the Korean word “daehaeng”. In context, as we have found in [127] above, the Overseas Agreement concerns parties’ mutual consent to the other entering into licensing agreements in respect of overseas markets without binding the other party to perform any obligations in relation to such licensing agreements. Further the 2004 Settlement Record does not purport to alter or extinguish the irrevocable entrustment established by the 2002 Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The second difficulty is that the recital itself is couched in the present and future tense, suggesting that the “entrustment” is not something in the past but something that is being achieved by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. While a careful common lawyer drafting an agreement would not put a provision intended to establish an obligation on the parties in the recital only, this is certainly not an invariable rule of drafting and the court’s task is to make sense of the agreement as a whole. In this regard, it is to be noted that the Seoul High Court judgment rendered on 28 January 2021 quoted the relevant part of the recital of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement as consisting of its “principal terms”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The third difficulty is that all parties apparently considered it necessary to have a tripartite agreement. CNB undertook technical obligations, and it would certainly be commercially sensible that any dispute that might arise concerning not only the performance of such obligations between CNB and CND / CNE but also the performance of any obligations of co-licensors or the licensee under the SLA should be resolved in arbitral proceedings to which they all could be parties, and under the same governing law. The same logic applies to potential disputes involving CND / CNE about extensions and amendments that CNA might agree to, based on the irrevocable entrustment. We therefore do not accept CND / CNE’s contention that we should presume that CNA and CNB intended that their relationship be governed only by bipartite agreements governed by Korean law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The fourth difficulty is that when CNA and CND had the opportunity to identify the source of CNA’s authority for the purpose of the 2017 Extension Agreement, they identified it as the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. The description given to the 2002 Supplementary Agreement in the second recital to the 2017 Extension Agreement was that it “amended the [SLA] to add [CNB] as a co-Licensor… and [CNB] irrevocably entrusted [CNA] to exercise all rights as a co-licensor on behalf of [CNB]”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The plaintiffs explain this reference in the 2017 Extension Agreement on the basis that it concerns CNA’s apparent authority rather than its actual authority. That is an unconvincing and strained explanation. The recital clearly states that it was by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement that CNB entrusted CNA. A simpler reading is that as of 2017, CNA and CND considered that the tripartite 2002 Supplementary Agreement was the source of CNA’s authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 With all of these considerations in mind, we find that the entrustment of CNB’s rights as co-licensor to CNA took place in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, is subject to the ICC Clause, and is governed by Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 5: If the source of CNA’s authority is the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, whether CNA breached any duties owed to CNB / CNC under Singapore law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether CNA breached its fiduciary duties to CNB / CNC</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Does CNA owe CNB / CNC fiduciary duties?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The plaintiffs contend that CNA did not owe any fiduciary duties to CNB / CNC under Singapore law.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Co-owners do not owe fiduciary duties to each other at common law simply by virtue of their co-ownership. Each is free to exploit the co-owned property. However, the relationship between CNA and CNB did not remain merely one of co-ownership. Upon CNB’s entrustment of its rights as co-licensor, CNA was empowered on CNB’s behalf to alter CNB’s legal relationship with CND / CNE by making amendments of or extensions to the SLA. Thus, CNA acquired the power to bind CNB to terms agreed by CNA with CND / CNE concerning CNB’s performance of positive obligations, such as the provision of technical support. Such terms included governing law and dispute resolution clauses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Thus, from the 2002 Supplementary Agreement onwards, in respect of amendments of or extensions to the SLA, CNA was CNB’s agent. The agency relationship is one of the established categories of fiduciary relationship. However, whether that fiduciary relationship does in fact give rise to fiduciary duties depends on the facts and context of the particular case: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [210]. In the same paragraph, the Court of Appeal suggests but does not definitively conclude that “there is a <span class="font-italic">presumption</span> that an established fiduciary <span class="font-italic">relationship</span> does give rise to fiduciary <span class="font-italic">duties</span>, which presumption may be rebutted on the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">facts and context</span> of the particular case.”  [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In this particular case, the facts and context support the conclusion that CNA owed fiduciary duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 First, it is important to note that as the agency related to co-owned property, any fiduciary duty imposed would be to act in the joint interest of both co-owners, rather than in the sole interest of either of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 As part of acting in their joint interest, CNA was certainly entitled to have its own view on what that joint interest was. This exercise would necessarily entail considering its own commercial interest when deciding on amendments of and extensions to the SLA. However, this is not inconsistent with a fiduciary duty to the joint interest. In this connection it is helpful to refer to the English case of <span class="font-italic">Elton</span><span class="font-italic"> John v Richard Leon James</span> [1991] FSR 397. There, the publisher was assigned the copyright in certain musical works authored by the artist. The publisher had full control over how that copyright was to be exploited, but this was not for its benefit alone but for the joint benefit of publisher and artist. In holding that the publisher was subject to fiduciary duties, the English High Court, at 433–434, noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not think that the publisher’s freedom to consult its own commercial interest in balancing expense and risk against prospects of success is inconsistent with the existence of fiduciary duties such as I have stated. The object sought to be achieved by exploitation was maximising the pool of royalties received by the publisher and in which the writers would share. In seeking to attain that object, in which the parties had a joint interest, the publisher would exercise its own commercial skill and judgement; but in doing so the publisher would not be free to pursue its own commercial interests (as distinct from the joint interest).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We therefore reject the contention that CNA’s freedom to consult its own interest meant that it bore no fiduciary duty to the joint interest of CNA and CNB. The scope and content of fiduciary duties may vary according to the circumstances of each case. A limited fiduciary duty to another or to a joint interest with another may co-exist with the right to consider and refer to one’s own interests as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> v American Express Bank Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 cited with approval at [41] Mason J’s identification of the critical feature of fiduciary relationships in his dissent in the High Court of Australia’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Hospital Products Ltd v United Sta</span><span class="font-italic">tes Surgical Corporation and others </span>(1984) 55 ALR 417.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Mason J said at 454:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The critical feature … is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Mason J in his dissent noted at 454–455 that “contractual and fiduciary relationships may co-exist between the same parties”, and that “[t]he fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them.” Mason J went on to make the point, with which we agree, that while the “capacity to make decisions and take action in some matters by reference to its own interests is inconsistent with the existence of a general fiduciary relationship … it does not exclude the existence of a more limited fiduciary relationship”. Mason J further elaborated (at 456):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But entitlement to act in one’s own interests is not an answer to the existence of a fiduciary relationship, if there be an obligation to act in the interests of another. It is that obligation which is the foundation of the fiduciary relationship, even if it be subject to qualifications including the qualification that in some respects the fiduciary is entitled to act by reference to his own interests. The fiduciary duty must then accommodate itself to the relationship between the parties created by their contractual arrangements. And entitlement under the contract to act in a relevant matter solely by reference to one’s own interests will constitute an answer to an alleged breach of the fiduciary duty. The difficulty of deciding under the contract when the fiduciary is entitled to act in his own interests is not in itself a reason for rejecting the existence of a fiduciary relationship, though it may be an element in arriving at the conclusion that the person asserting the relationship has not established that there is any obligation to act in the interests of another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Thus, while the entirety of a relationship between two parties may not be fiduciary in nature, some activities undertaken within the overall relationship may have a fiduciary character. The exercise of power on behalf of another party may be an activity that has a fiduciary character even when the relationship as a whole is a commercial one. That is the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 One contention made is that the relationship between CNA and CNB has been defined in the 2004 Settlement Record, governed by Korean law, and that consequently no question of a fiduciary relationship under Singapore law can arise. We do not agree. The example given is that the 2004 Settlement Record imposed a duty on CNA to consult CNB. In equity, a fiduciary’s duty is not to consult the other but to act in the other’s interest. However, if such a duty to consult is imposed by contract, our view is that this does not necessarily displace the fiduciary duty. It is complementary and not substitutive. Accordingly, we would not agree that the imposition of a duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record displaced CNA’s duty of loyalty to their joint interest, which entailed not preferring the interest of CND and CNE, the counterparty to the SLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Thus, we hold that CNA in the exercise of its powers under the entrustment to extend or amend the SLA was subject to the fiduciary duty to act in the joint interest, which encompassed the equitable duty to exercise those powers in good faith and for proper purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In support of this formulation of the equitable duty constraining CNA’s exercise of its powers, we have referred to and relied on the discussion in an article cited by CNB, namely Sarah Worthington, “Fiduciaries Then and Now” (2021) 80(S1) <span class="font-italic">Cambridge Law Journal</span> s154. In particular, Worthington, after discussing exercises of power by a fiduciary, suggests that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The crucial lesson in all of this is that it is essential to distinguish between situations where the defaulting fiduciary’s self-interested gain is in the sightlines and the remedy sought is disgorgement, and situations where improper use of discretionary powers is in the sightlines. When the focus is the latter, on abuse of power and not fiduciary gains, the goal is typically to set aside the exercise of power, and, if necessary, either recover from the third party any assets that had been improperly transferred or, more likely, seek compensation from the power-holder for their unauthorised loss. These remedies apply not only where powers are exercised in bad faith or for improper purposes, but also where the power is exercised beyond its scope (i.e. where the power-holder has no authority to exercise the power, rather than merely acts within authority but improperly). [footnotes omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 This article was discussed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai </span>[2022] 2 SLR 1250<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [74]–[76] in the context of the question of where and when a director may owe concurrent fiduciary duties both to a third party and his principal company. In that case, the fiduciary relationship with the third party did not arise from an established category of fiduciary relationships but was an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> one. At [76], the Court of Appeal made the following observation concerning the objective nature of the analysis:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Indeed, as Prof Worthington goes on to observe in her article, a distinction which Prof Sealy drew between fiduciaries on one hand, and, on the other, persons not typically considered fiduciaries but possessing some discretion which needs to be exercised in good faith and for proper purposes (eg, holders of contractual discretions, mortgagees with a power of sale), is that Prof Sealy required a fiduciary (<span class="font-italic">Worthington</span> at s170): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if he acts at all, to act in accordance with the undertaking he <span class="font-italic">is seen to have given</span> not to act in his own interests. This is the legal constraint which addresses the moral hazard of having … fiduciaries in control of the principal’s property or in control of acting for and on behalf of the principal. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If it is sufficient that the putative fiduciary is <span class="font-italic">seen</span> to have given such an undertaking, that necessarily requires some degree of <span class="font-italic">objectivity</span> in the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The Court of Appeal then went on at [84]–[86] to consider and reject the argument advanced on behalf of the putative fiduciary that a director of a company to which he owes fiduciary obligations may not voluntarily undertake a role <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> a third party giving rise to fiduciary obligations, because a director owes a duty of single-minded loyalty to his principal company, and thus, had to place the interests of the company above all others including his own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 That the Court of Appeal held that the existence of a concurrent fiduciary duty to one person would not in law foreclose the possibility of a fiduciary duty arising concurrently in favour of another supports our holding in this case that CNA could in law (and on the facts did) owe fiduciary duties to the joint interest of CNA and CNB notwithstanding that CNA was entitled to consider its own interests before ultimately making any decision in the joint interest that altered its and CNB’s legal relations with CND and CNE.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Is CNA in breach of its fiduciary duties?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Assuming CNA owed fiduciary duties, the plaintiffs contend that it did not breach them. CNA had complied with its duty to consult, and extending the SLA by way of the 2017 Extension Agreement (including changing the ICC Clause and the governing law) cohered with commercial sense. In short, the plaintiffs’ case is that a sensible bargain was struck, or at the minimum, a deal that was not adverse to CNA and CNB / CNC had been made.

Under Korean law, a partner owes a duty of care to the partnership itself rather than to the other partners or to any particular partner pursuant to Art 681 of the Civil Code (Korea). The duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” must also be read together with Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea), and under the context of a partnership, CNA is only subject to the “Seonkwan Ei-mu” duty within the scope of the “good faith standard” stipulated under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) CNA fulfilled the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” by entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement, because it ensured that the partnership did not suffer lost revenues as well as other damages from terminating the SLA. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Even if CNA was in breach of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu”, the 2017 Extension Agreement is valid. The 2004 Settlement Record does not stipulate the consequences of a breach of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” or the duty to consult. Professor Kim opines that Korean courts will deal with such a breach by considering the parties’ motives and circumstances leading to the 2004 Settlement Record, as well as its purpose. Given the parties’ mutual understanding that the consent of the other party is not required to renew the existing licence agreements under the 2004 Settlement Record, it is unlikely that a court would find that any breach of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” or the duty to consult would invalidate the renewal of the SLA through the 2017 Extension Agreement.

However, the defendants disagree with CND and CNE’s description of CNB and CNA’s relationship as akin to that of a partnership. This is incorrect because a partnership is usually established in the form of a joint venture and the relationship between CNA and CNB does not rest on an agreement to “carry on a joint undertaking by making mutual contribution thereto” which is the definition of a partnership under Art 703 of the Civil Act (Korea). Rather, from the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, CNB had entrusted CNA with the exercise of its rights as co-licensor under the SLA, which falls within the definition of a mandate. Further, CND / CNE’s conclusion on the existence of a partnership is premised on CNB and CNA being joint holders, when in actual fact, they are joint authors.

</div> Where parties differ is the scope and extent of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” and the interaction of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” and Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea). CNA takes the position that the person entrusted may ignore the instructions of the person who entrusts that are against the interests of the person entrusted if disobeying the instructions is not fundamentally against the nature of the mandate. Further, CNA posits that the scope of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” does not include a common law duty of loyalty and it applies only to the extent that it is consistent with Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on the “good faith standard”). As for CND and CNE, their interpretation of the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” is that it is a duty owed by each partner to the partnership itself, and further that the duty not to prevent an agreement or refuse consent in bad faith under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) takes precedence over the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu”. On CNB’s interpretation of the “Seonkwan Ei-mu”, however, the duty of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” outweighs the duty under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) not to prevent the unanimous agreement between joint authors from being reached or refuse to consent in bad faith. The irreducible minimum of “Seonkwan Ei-mu”, as agreed upon by parties, is therefore a duty to act in good faith towards the partnership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In our view, the key question under Korean law is the nature and content of the duty to consult contained in the 2004 Settlement Record.

The first is that CNB’s objections concerned clarity of scope (which would impact pricing) and the lack of engagement on the issue of alleged past breaches by CND / CNE. Both of these objections appear to have been genuinely held, and a meaningful process of consultation could have potentially resolved them. The second is that, like the Tribunal,

If, in so acting in breach of its duty, the agent acted by compromising the principal’s interests in favour of his own or a third party’s or subordinated the principal’s interests either to its own or third party’s interest, and if the counterparty knew or could have known of such abuse of authority by the agent, then the principal would not be held liable for such action of the agent, and, accordingly, the agreement so executed by the agent would be deemed void between the principal and the counterparty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In this case, we would find that when CNA negotiated and executed the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB, CNA failed to consult CNB at all concerning the changes to governing law, seat and arbitral institution, and did not properly or genuinely consult CNB on the extension in general. In fact, it went along with CND’s / CNE’s desire to execute the extension quickly so that it could be raised in the latter’s Answer in the Present Arbitration. This was a breach of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” and based on our objective review of the facts and relevant circumstances presented to us, we find that CNA acted with an intent of breaching its duty in executing the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB, whereby it abused its authority in such manner as would compromise CNB’s interest in favour of the counterparty, CND / CNE, and subordinate CNB’s interests to those of CND / CNE. It is also clear that CND / CNE instigated this breach of duty in full knowledge that this would be a breach of CNA’s duty. In particular, with respect to the change in the arbitration institution as suggested by CND / CNE and included in the 2017 Extension Agreement, CND / CNE knew or ought to have recognised that CNA's act of agreeing thereto (and executing the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB) went against CNB’s interests, for the benefit of CND / CNE.

</div> The validity of the extension was in their submission within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. We understand their submission to be that the rest of the relief that was added amounted to consequential relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 We note that CND and CNE have not contended that events after commencement of an arbitration may not form part of the dispute referred to arbitration or found claims or relief within it. It is of course necessary that “[a]ny new claim or cause of action … must require … clear identification and admission by the arbitration tribunal” and that this “is particularly so with a claim only allegedly arising after commencement of an arbitration”: <span class="font-italic">per</span> <span class="font-italic">CBX and another v CBZ and others</span> [2022] 1 SLR 47 at [51].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The thrust of CND and CNE’s argument is not that the events relied on post-date commencement of the arbitration but that any disputes relating to them must fall under the SHIAC Clause.  We understand their submission to be that even if the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to consider whether its mandate was terminated by the 2017 Extension Agreement, including whether the extension was obtained in breach of fiduciary duty, it had no jurisdiction to consider new claims because such new claims are governed by the SHIAC Clause. Thus, even though the Tribunal held that the 2017 Extension Agreement was not valid in the course of rejecting the challenge to its mandate and even if the court agreed in its own <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> review that the Tribunal was correct to do so, this did not entitle the Tribunal to then determine on the merits claims that were governed by the SHIAC Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 We do not accept CND and CNE’s argument. In this case, there was an existing relationship between principal, agent and third party which was governed by the ICC Clause. The validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement was challenged on the basis that there was a breach of fiduciary duty that arose from that existing relationship. This distinguishes this case from situations where the only question is under which of two or more valid arbitration clauses a particular dispute arises. As the 2017 Extension Agreement (including the change to the arbitration clause) did not bind CNB, the operative arbitration agreement remained the ICC Clause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in ruling on whether CNA had breached the duty to consult</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 CND and CNE submit that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction when it determined that CNA breached the duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record by entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement. The parties to the SLA did not consent to arbitrate disputes arising under the 2004 Settlement Record under the ICC Clause in the SLA. The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider a dispute under the 2004 Settlement Record and parties had not submitted such a dispute to the Tribunal. Despite the common understanding between parties on the ambit of the ICC Clause, the Tribunal made findings in the First Partial Award that CNA owed CNB a duty to consult as to the renewal of the SLA.

It did so at CND / CNE’s instigation because CND / CNE wanted to rely on the change from the ICC Clause to the SHIAC Clause as a jurisdictional objection in the Present Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 This was a breach of CNA’s fiduciary duty and CNB was entitled to and did avoid the 2017 Extension Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Consequently, the ICC Clause remained operative and the Tribunal did not cease to have jurisdiction over the disputes referred to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 We dismiss both applications to set aside the First Partial Award in their entirety.

On the same basis, the plaintiffs applied also to set aside the award on costs arising from the findings made in the First Partial Award (the “Second Partial Award”, collectively with the First Partial Award, the “Partial Awards”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The issue central to the setting aside applications is whether the arbitration clause providing for a Singapore-law governing clause and an ICC arbitration in Singapore (the “ICC Clause”) pursuant to which the Present Arbitration had been commenced was superseded on 30 June 2017 by the arbitration clause providing for arbitration before the Shanghai International Arbitration Centre (“SHIAC”) seated in Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China(the “PRC”) (the “SHIAC Clause”) in the agreement which extended a software licensing agreement for an additional term of five years (the “2017 Extension Agreement”). The Tribunal rejected this argument on the basis that the entry into the 2017 Extension Agreement by CNA had happened in breach of its fiduciary duty.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 CNA is an entity whose principal business is the development of PC and mobile games. CND is the wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CNE. CND and CNE are part of a group which is a leading developer, operator and publisher of online games. The defendants are CNB and CNC. CNB is engaged in the business of developing and providing services related to Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (“MMORPG”) and mobile game software. CNC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNB.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 In 1997, the first iteration of the game [X] was developed. CNA was founded by the developers and an investor. Their relationship broke down in 1999, and CNB was established in early 2000. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 CNA and CNB entered into a series of agreements to regulate their relationship as co-owners of the copyright in the products in the game series, which includes the sequel game [X2]. The development of the game [X2] was completed around September 2000.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 On 18 February 2000, CNA and CNB entered into the Basic Agreement (the “Basic Agreement”), which provided that they would cooperate with each other regarding the joint development of the game [X] series and execute a separate joint development agreement.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 On 23 February 2000, CNA and CNB entered into the Domestic Agreement to regulate their respective roles in the development and dealership of the game [X].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 On 26 February 2021, CNA and CNB entered into the Overseas Agreement which set out terms pertaining to the joint development and overseas sales of the game series.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 On 29 June 2001, CNA, solely in its name, entered into the Software Licensing Agreement (the “SLA”) with the predecessors of CND and CNE. Under the SLA, CNE was granted the sole and exclusive distribution licence for the Chinese-language version of the [computer game [X2] delivered in formats including CD-ROM and <span class="font-italic">via</span> the internet. The SLA contained the ICC Clause. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Following the SLA, the Chinese-language version of the game [X2] was launched around late 2001 in the PRC to resounding success. After the success of the game [X2], in or around December 2001, bugs and cheating programs started to interfere with its operation. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 Eventually, on 14 July 2002, CNA, CNB and CNE entered into a Supplementary Agreement to the SLA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 2002 Supplementary Agreement), which detailed CNB’s obligation, as co-licensor, to CNE to resolve technical problems that might affect the servicing and normal operation of the computer game [X2] in the PRC.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Between 2003 and 2004, multiple proceedings in the Korean courts were brought by CNA and CNB against each other. There were over 20 lawsuits filed between the parties during that time.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 On 29 April 2004, CNA and CNB agreed to settle all pending litigation in the Korean courts by way of a settlement agreement reviewed, approved, recorded and sealed by the Seoul Central District Court (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 2004 Settlement Record). The 2004 Settlement Record contained terms on the allocation of sales and revenue recognition for overseas sales and agreements entered into by each party with respect to the game [X2] and the threequel, the game [X3], as well as each party’s right to separately execute licence agreements with third parties in relation to the game [X2] and the game [X3].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Subsequently, the SLA was assigned, amended and extended several more times over the years, by CNA entering into an agreement with CNE or their assignees. CNB was not a party to these agreements, save for the 2009 Supplementary Agreement that was made between CNA, CNB and CNE to set out the terms and conditions under which CNB would provide specified textual and/or graphical content pertaining to the game [X2] and technical support directly to CNE.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 From 2013, the demand for PC-client games began to shrink, while the demand for web and mobile games started to grow rapidly. On the back of the change in market trends, the parties began negotiating an arrangement to exploit the mobile version of the game [X2]. On 10 March 2015, CND entered into two separate mobile games licence agreements with CNB and CNA respectively to develop the mobile version of the game [X2].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 However, around that same period, CNB discovered that CND (acting on behalf of CNE) or CNE did not merely use the authorisation letters it previously provided to them to police the infringing activities in the PRC (which was the basis upon which the letters were sought). Instead, these authorisation letters were used to grant “sub-licences” for the game [X2] PC-client, web and mobile games. This was in breach of CNE’s limited licence under the SLA, which CND / CNE acknowledged in early 2015 to mid-2016. Pursuant to the concession, CND / CNE agreed to inform CNB of all the “sub-licences” which had been granted, and to remit the profits made to CNB and CNC.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 CNA and CNB diverged in their responses to this. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 In or around August 2016, CNA issued an authorisation letter for CND and CNE covering the period of 29 September 2015 to 28 September 2017 (the “2016 Authorisation Letter”). The 2016 Authorisation Letter purported to give CND and CNE the rights to “compile and permit use by third party” and “transfer and sub-authorize all rights under this contract to a third party”. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 CNB commenced the Present Arbitration on 18 May 2017 against CND and CNE for their breaches of the SLA. On 23 May 2017, CNC succeeded to all of CNB’s rights and obligations in respect of the game [X2], including the SLA, by way of a vertical spin-off.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 On 20 June 2017, CND / CNE requested a time extension from the ICC to enable them to consider CNB / CNC’s Request for Arbitration and to seek legal advice before filing their Answer. The ICC granted an extension of time until 18 August 2017. Between the request for the time extension and the deadline, CNA entered into the 2017 Extension Agreement with CND and CNE on 30 June 2017. Thereafter, CND and CNE filed their Answer, where they relied on the SHIAC Clause in the newly executed 2017 Extension Agreement to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 On 22 August 2017, CND commenced a parallel SHIAC arbitration against CNA seeking a declaration that the 2017 Extension Agreement was valid and effective. The tribunal in the SHIAC arbitration delivered its award on 23 January 2018, confirming the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 In the Present Arbitration, the Tribunal was constituted on 27 December 2017. Following the award from the SHIAC arbitration,  CNB / CNC applied to the Tribunal for interim relief including the restraining of the enforcement of the SHIAC award. On jurisdiction, the claimants in the Present Arbitration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CNB and CNC) argued that the ICC Clause applied such that the alleged breaches under the SLA fell within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The gist of the case mounted by the respondents in the Present Arbitration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CNA, CND and CNE) was that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the SLA was breached because the ICC Clause, which formed the basis of its jurisdiction, had been terminated, replaced and/or superseded by the SHIAC Clause in the 2017 Extension Agreement. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 On 8 June 2020, the Tribunal issued the First Partial Award. On 31 July 2021, the Tribunal issued the Second Partial Award.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 In Originating Applications Nos. 2 to 5 of 2022, the claimants seek to set aside the Partial Awards on the following main grounds:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. First, the entirety of the First Partial Award should be set aside on the basis that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the entire dispute because the ICC Clause pursuant to which the Arbitration was commenced was terminated and/or superseded on 30 June 2017 by the SHIAC Clause in the 2017 Extension Agreement.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. Further, and/or in any event, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. Alternatively, the First Partial Award ought to be partially set aside because it exceeded its jurisdiction in ruling on whether CNA had breached the duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record and it had no jurisdiction to make orders and/or declarations in favour of CNB.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. Consequently, the Second Partial Award should be set aside to the extent that the First Partial Award is set aside.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">25 The defendants rely on the following key arguments:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. First, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute because the Present Arbitration was commenced before the 2017 Extension Agreement was signed.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. Further, the Tribunal rightly exercised its jurisdiction under the ICC Clause because the 2017 Extension Agreement (containing the SHIAC Clause) is invalid. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. Even if the First Partial Award is partially set aside, there is no basis to set aside the Second Partial Award on costs. The costs awarded were based on the overall success on the jurisdictional and merits issues which would remain substantially the same even if CND and CNE succeeded on any of their alternative grounds.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">26 The standard of review applicable in the present case is a <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> review. Under the <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> standard of review, the court is unfettered by any principle limiting its fact-finding abilities. It is open to this court to place weight on the Tribunal’s primary findings of fact, if they are found to be useful, while coming to its own view on any secondary inferences, but the court is not bound to do so. In this case, there is basis for the Tribunal’s findings that CNA acted in haste and secrecy: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">79]–[84]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">27 In relation to the conduct of the plaintiffs, CNA entered into the 2017 Extension Agreement knowing full well that CNB did not want it renewed. CNA chose not to consult CNB on the terms of the renewal precisely because CNA knew of CNB’s concerns and objections to the renewal. This knowledge and motivation are apparent from the contemporaneous documents: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">94]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">28 On the applicability of the doctrine of separability, the doctrine does not have the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement in any event. Although parties may exercise their choice of forum and governing law as arbitration is built on consent and party autonomy, this begged the question of whose consent and whose autonomy given that the governing law and forum were purportedly changed after an arbitration was filed under the original dispute resolution clause, knowing that CNB objected to any extension and would undoubtedly object to the change to the dispute resolution clause: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">101] and [104]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">29 The source of CNA’s authority to amend or extend the SLA on behalf of CNB is the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. Neither the Korean agreements nor the 2004 Settlement Record contain any language of entrustment of co-licensor’s rights. The recital itself is couched in the present and future tense, suggesting that the “entrustment” is not something in the past but something that is being achieved by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. All parties considered it necessary to have a tripartite agreement. It is commercially sensible that any dispute that might arise concerning not only the performance of such obligations between CNB and CND / CNE but also the performance of any obligations of co-licensors or the licensee under the SLA should be resolved in arbitral proceedings to which they all could be parties, and under the same governing law. When CNA and CND had the opportunity to identify the source of CNA’s authority for the purpose of the 2017 Extension Agreement, they identified it as the 2002 Supplementary Agreement: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">133]–[138]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">30 There is no issue estoppel for the source of authority as the earlier interim award characterised the basis for the claims as being one between co-owners, with the Domestic and Overseas Agreements formulating and regulating their relationship concerning recognition of sales revenue, shares of commissions, royalties, development costs and other matters. In contrast, the Supplementary Agreement is primarily concerned with the licensing arrangements by both CNA and CNB (as one interest bloc) with CNE. The 2005 Interim Award does not contain any finding expressly or by necessary implication that CNA’s authority to act on CNB’s behalf in relation to CND was to be found in the Domestic or Overseas Agreement: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">117] and [118]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">31 If the source of CNA’s authority is the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, CNA breached duties owed to CNB / CNC under Singapore law. CNA owed a fiduciary duty to the joint interest of both co-owners, rather than in the sole interest of either of them. While the entirety of a relationship between two parties may not be fiduciary in nature, some activities undertaken within the overall relationship may have a fiduciary character. CNA in the exercise of its powers under the entrustment to extend or amend the SLA was subject to the fiduciary duty to act in the joint interest, which encompassed the equitable duty to exercise those powers in good faith and for proper purposes. Any good faith exercise of the power to extend or amend the SLA would entail consulting CNB. The express duty to consult under 2004 Settlement Record was not merely complementary to but reinforcing of the duty to act in good faith: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">143]–[145], [149], [151] and [166]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">32 In any event, even if the source of CNA’s authority is the 2004 Settlement Record, there was a breach of “Seonkwan Ei-mu” when CNA negotiated and executed the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB without consulting CNB at all concerning the changes to governing law, seat and arbitral institution, and did not properly or genuinely consult CNB on the extension in general: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">175]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">33 On the alternative case brought by the plaintiffs which concerns the scope of the jurisdiction conferred on the Tribunal by the ICC Clause, the Tribunal had jurisdiction to (a) decide on the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement; (b) determine the claims added by CNB and CNC after the 207 Extension Agreement was concluded; (c) ruling on whether CNA breached the duty to consult; (d) make orders and/or declarations in favour of CNB; (e) make the finding that the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2]; (f) determine the allegations against CND and CNE in respect of mobile games: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[182], [188]  [192], [195], [197] and [200]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">34 For these reasons, the claimants’ applications to set aside the Partial Awards on the basis that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction are dismissed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">205].</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
