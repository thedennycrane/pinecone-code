Fourth, I have assigned pseudonyms to each of the employees or directors of the respondents who feature in these grounds.

That limb provides that “[a]n arbitral award may be set aside … if the party making the application furnishes proof that … the arbitration agreement … is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it …”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On its face, the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) appears to be premised on an arbitration agreement that has been formed between the parties (as indicated by the use of the definite article in the phrase “<span class="font-italic">the</span> arbitration agreement” in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)) but which is subject to some internal or external factor which vitiates it or renders it unenforceable (as indicated by the words “is <span class="font-italic">not valid</span>” in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)). The second limb does not, on its face, appear apt to cover an argument that no arbitration agreement has ever existed between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This appears especially to be the case when the language of the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is contrasted with the language of Art 16(1) of the Model Law. Article 16(1) empowers the tribunal to decide whether an arbitration agreement <span class="font-italic">exists</span> or is valid. The second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), on the other hand, allows the court to set aside an award only if the arbitration agreement “is not valid”. The Model Law thereby appears to recognise a distinction between existence and validity as concepts and appears to have taken a conscious decision to rest the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) only on the concept of validity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is nevertheless well established that the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) extends to a challenge to an award on the grounds that no arbitration agreement between has ever existed between the parties (<span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</span> [2014] 1 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK</span>”) at [156]; <span class="font-italic">Jiangsu Overseas Group Co Ltd v Concord Energy Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1336 (“<span class="font-italic">Jiangsu Overseas</span>”) at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is equally well-established that a court hearing a challenge under the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is not only entitled but obliged to determine for itself, on the merits, whether an arbitration agreement exists and is valid. That is ultimately because arbitration is consensual. A tribunal can exercise no jurisdiction over any person unless that person has consented to the tribunal doing so. That consent is not subjective consent but is instead consent given in accordance with the law of contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the law in the applicable legal system that governs obligations voluntarily undertaken. Consent give in this way will bind the person giving it in accordance with that law. The arbitration agreement must also satisfy the statutory requirements of s 2A of the Act and Art 7 of the Model Law in order for it to come within the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 A court hearing a challenge under the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) must therefore determine for itself <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties and is valid (<span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [163]). Both the parties and the court are therefore free of any and all constraints arising from the manner in which the parties and the tribunal dealt with the same issue in the arbitration, whether any such constraint is said to arise from the arguments presented or not presented to the tribunal, from the evidence that the parties placed or did not place before the tribunal, or from the findings of fact and holdings of law that the tribunal made or did not make in arriving at its conclusions on this issue and on the ultimate issue of its own jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Jiangsu Overseas </span>at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The court approaches a challenge under the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> because it is properly the court’s role to determine whether an arbitration agreement exists and is valid. It is true that the Act and the Model Law give the tribunal jurisdiction to decide this issue (s 10(2) of the Act and Art 16(1) of the Model Law). And it is also true that a court will allow the tribunal to have the first opportunity to decide this issue even if only a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case is made out on this issue (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and another appeal</span> [2016] 1 SLR 373 at [67]). That is the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">kompetenz-kompetenz</span> as enacted under s 10(2) of the Act and as applied in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 But the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">kompetenz-kompetenz</span> rests on a legal fiction: that a tribunal whose jurisdiction rests on consent can itself determine whether that consent exists. The unalterable logical reality is that a tribunal cannot pull itself up by its own bootstraps. A determination whether that consent exists can only be made by the national courts of a state. Only those courts exercise a mandatory jurisdiction over the parties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a jurisdiction that does not rest on consent but instead on the coercive powers of the state. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The law adopts and applies the legal fiction of <span class="font-italic">kompetenz-kompetenz</span> for policy reasons, in order to advance arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution method. This legal fiction favours the risk of a false positive over a false negative. It is better for a tribunal to decide the issue of jurisdiction even if the tribunal does not in fact have jurisdiction than it is for the court to decide the issue when a tribunal does in fact have jurisdiction. This approach amounts in substance to a presumption in favour of existence and validity which arises upon establishing a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on that issue. This presumption serves to foster the adoption and growth of arbitration as a mode of alternative dispute resolution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The fact remains, however, that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">kompetenz-kompetenz</span> does not remove and vest in a tribunal the court’s original civil jurisdiction to decide with finality whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties and is valid. The doctrine merely postpones the exercise of the court’s original civil jurisdiction to determine that issue in order to allow a tribunal the first opportunity to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 When a party fails before a tribunal on this issue and places it before a court <span class="font-italic">via</span> a permissible avenue (s 10(3) of the Act and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law), the court therefore determines that issue in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. That is why a court does not approach an application under either of these avenues as a setting aside application or even as an appeal from the tribunal’s decision. In so far as the heading to s 10 of the Act suggests that an application under s 10(3) is an appeal, in my view it goes too far. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 What I have described thus far is the court’s conceptual approach to determining whether an arbitration exists and is valid. This must be kept separate from the court’s procedural approach to any such determination. The court determining a jurisdictional challenge <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> remains free to exercise its procedural discretion in the usual way. That discretion extends to what evidence it will receive, whether it is content to rely on the evidence presented to the tribunal or wishes to receive evidence anew and whether it receives the evidence on affidavit alone or<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">viva voce</span>, with or without cross-examination. Thus, the fact that the court’s conceptual approach to this issue is to treat the application as a hearing <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> does not give a party a right to insist on the court undertaking a full rehearing of the evidence led before the tribunal (<span class="font-italic">AQZ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ARA</span> [2015] 2 SLR 972 at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the exercise of this procedural discretion, I allowed each respondent, despite the claimant’s objections,

Thus, for example, I allowed the third respondent to adduce and rely on a substantial affidavit from a witness even though that witness did not give evidence in the arbitration. The affidavit goes into great detail into parties’ negotiations in March 2016 and the intentions of the parties during those negotiations. The fact that the respondents could have but did not place this evidence before the tribunal was no bar in itself to the respondents seeking to adduce that evidence on an application under the second limb of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law. In the exercise of my discretion, I considered that this evidence was of some conceivable relevance, would not delay the hearing of the substantive application and would not cause the claimant any prejudice for which it could not be compensated by costs.

This background includes the industry the parties are in, the character of the documents alleged to constitute the contract as well as the course of dealings between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In conducting this objective exercise, the court will consider the whole course of the parties’ negotiations to ascertain whether an agreement was reached at any given point in time (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [53]; <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">hina Coal Solution (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Avra Commodities Pte Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 984 at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In accordance with the objective approach, once both parties have, to all outward appearances, manifested their agreement on the same terms on the same subject-matter, one party generally cannot rely on some unexpressed qualification or reservation which it continued to hold to show that he did not in fact agree to the terms to which he appeared to agree. The subjective reservations of one party cannot prevent the formation of a contract (<span class="font-italic">Lim Koon Park and another v Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Jin Meng Bryan and another</span> [2013] 4 SLR 150 at [66], citing <span class="font-italic">Aircharter</span><span class="font-italic"> World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 440 at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) There is an identifiable agreement when the parties have reached a <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span>. This <span class="font-italic">consensus</span> is usually identified by reference to an offer made by the offeror which is then accepted by the offeree.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) An offer must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [47], citing M P Furmston, <span class="font-italic">Cheshire, </span><span class="font-italic">Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract</span> (Oxford University Press, 15th Ed, 2007) at p 40).  </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [47], citing Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span><span class="font-italic">: The Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) at para 2-015). Even if an offeree does not communicate express acceptance of the offer, the offeree’s positive, negative or even neutral conduct is capable of evincing an intention to accept the offer (<span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Italmatic Tyre &amp; Retreading Equipment (Asia) Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 4 SLR 883 at [20], citing <span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [50] and [52]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The parties’ subsequent conduct can be considered in determining whether a contract has been formed (<span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Jiacipto Jiaravanon </span>[2019] 1 SLR 696 at [78]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) It is possible for parties to form a contract on a set of essential terms at a given point in time, even if negotiations continue past that point on other terms of the contract which are non-essential. The fact that the non-essential terms are not agreed “does not prevent the contract based on the essential core terms from coming into existence” at the earlier point in time (<span class="font-italic">R1 International </span>at [52]). The crucial question is whether the parties, by their words and conduct, objectively ascertained, demonstrated that they intended to be bound by the essential terms from that point in time even though their negotiations on the non-essential terms continued (<span class="font-italic">Rudhra</span><span class="font-italic"> Minerals Pte Ltd v MRI Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1023 at [27]). If so, the contract is formed at that time and binds the parties, unless the continued negotiations show that the parties agreed to revoke the agreement (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Finally, and as an overarching point, a court does not analyse contract formation in a rigidly mechanical or dogmatic manner. Although the correct approach remains to examine the whole course of the parties’ negotiations to isolate and identify offer and acceptance, this must be done while having regard to the entire background and context (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I now turn to examine the negotiations in March 2016 to determine whether the claimant can establish its submission that a contract arose out of negotiations in March 2016 that incorporated a term obliging the claimant and the respondents to resolve disputes arising from that contract by arbitration (see [59] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The negotiations in March 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The negotiations in March 2016 involved a number of executives from the claimant and from the respondents.

</div> The term “Contractor” is left blank, to be filled in as necessary once negotiations with a particular supplier concluded in an agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 NDU-1 defines a number of material terms. The plural term “Parties” is defined as both the first respondent and the Contractor collectively; with the singular term “Party” defined as either one of them individually. The term “Company” is defined as the third respondent. The term “Payment Obligations” is defined as the second respondent’s payment obligations to the Contractor pursuant to unpaid invoices to be listed in an annex to NDU-1. The term “Invoices” is defined to mean the unpaid invoices listed in the annex. The term “Security Interest” is defined as a security interest of any kind over the shares in the third respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The recitals to NDU-1 record the following as the factual background leading up to it:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the third respondent is in the process of constructing the Project in Gondor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the first respondent holds 99.99% of the shares in the third respondent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the third respondent engaged the second respondent as its contractor for the Project; and the second respondent had “sub-contracted a part of the supply” for the Project to the Contractor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Invoices were pending payment from the second respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Notably, the recitals do not even mention the Rohan Group’s desire to maintain continuity of supply as part of the factual background to NDU-1, let alone impose it as an obligation on the Contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The contractual heart of NDU-1 is found in cll 2.1 to 2.3. These three clauses set out the first respondent’s undertaking to the Contractor to retain 24% of the shares in the third respondent until either the first respondent or the second respondent pays the sums due to the Contractor on the Invoices, subject only to the first respondent’s power to create a future Security Interest in favour of lenders to raise financing for the Project. Clause 2.1 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.1 Save for as set out herein or specifically permitted by the Contractor, [the first respondent] shall until the complete discharge of the Payment Obligations by [the second respondent], continue to legally and beneficially hold and retain at least 24% (Twenty Four per cent) of the equity in [the third respondent]… (“<span class="font-weight-bold">NDU Shares</span>”) free of any Security Interest, and shall not, without prior approval from the Contractor, until the full and complete discharge of the Payment Obligations, sell, transfer, assign, dispose of, pledge, charge or create any Security Interest on the NDU Shares in favour of any person…”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The reason NDU-1 covered only 24% of the shares in the third respondent was that, at the time Boromir drafted it, the first respondent had already pledged 76% of the shares in the third respondent to a consortium of lenders to secure project finance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Clause 2.2 of NDU-1 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2 Provided that the limitation set out in this Clause 2 shall not prevent [the first respondent] or shall require [the first respondent] from obtaining any consent from the Contractor for creating any Security Interest over all or part of the NDU Shares in favour of project finance lender(s), and upon such creation, the undertaking set out herein shall automatically get subordinated to the newly created Security Interest in favour of the project finance lenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Clause 2.3 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.3 All obligations under this Undertaking shall automatically terminate upon payment of the Invoices by [the second respondent] or [the first respondent].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the course of the negotiations, the respondents referred to NDU-1 as creating a “pledge”. That is obviously not correct. NDU-1 did not create a pledge of the first respondent’s shares in the claimant in favour of the Contractor in any sense of the word. It did not even claim to do so. NDU-1 was merely the first respondent’s undertaking not to dispose of 24% of the shares in the third respondent until the second respondent paid the Contractor in full all sums due on the Invoices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Clause 8 of NDU-1 provides that it is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Gondor. Clause 9 provides that disputes under NDU-1 which cannot be resolved amicably are to be submitted to arbitration in Gondor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The signature block of NDU-1 records that Boromir is to execute it as a deed for and on behalf of the first respondent. Notably, NDU-1 makes no provision whatsoever for the Contractor to execute it. That is no doubt because the contractual content of NDU-1 is entirely unilateral. NDU-1 does not even attempt to impose any obligation of any kind on the Contractor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">13 March 2016 – the claimant suspends delivery of Modules </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 On or around 13 March 2016, Legolas asked Samwise to convey to Aragon that the claimant would suspend all further deliveries of Modules for the Project until the claimant received payment for Modules already delivered.

He assured Legolas that the Rohan Group was committed to paying the sums due to the claimant for Modules delivered for the Project and that the Project was on track to achieve commercial operation if the remaining Modules were delivered without further delay. Achieving commercial operation would release the bank financing which the Rohan Group had already secured. Out of that financing, the claimant would be paid in full for all Modules sold and delivered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Legolas would not relent.

</div>
</div> 18 March 2016 was when Gimli released the Modules after Gandalf had spoken to Legolas (see [96] to [104] above). Legolas agreed to resume delivery of the Modules because he accepted Gandalf’s personal request not to require any of the changes to NDU-3 that Gimli had proposed in NDU-4 as a condition for resuming delivery. These communications on 18 March 2016 gave rise to a full terms contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 For the reasons which follow, I accept that a holistic assessment of the March 2016 negotiations shows that the parties did indeed conclude a contract on “basic or essential terms” on 17 March 2016 and a contract on full terms on 18 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Two observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In arriving at this conclusion, I bear in mind the following two observations about contract formation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 First, whether a contract has been formed is a question of law. And this question of law is to be determined on the usual objective approach applicable in the law of contract. A party’s subjective belief about contract formation is of no legal effect if that belief is not made manifest at the time. So too, a party’s subjective belief about whether a particular communication is an offer, a counteroffer, an acceptance of an offer or a rejection of an offer is of no legal effect if it is not made manifest at the time. Thus, it is perfectly possible for parties to have satisfied all the requirements to conclude a contract as a matter of law without realising it when it happens. They are nevertheless bound by that contract. That is so even if both parties have a subjective and privately held belief that they have not concluded a contract and therefore conduct themselves after that point in time as though they are continuing to negotiate a contract yet to be formed. The parties’ subjective and privately held beliefs cannot override the legal effect of their conduct in satisfying the requirements for contract formation at the earlier point in time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 There is therefore a need for extreme caution when receiving evidence as to the negotiating parties’ subjective and privately held beliefs during their negotiations. That is so when the evidence is contemporaneous, <span class="font-italic">e</span><span class="font-italic">g</span> communications while the negotiations are taking place, but which are internal to one party. That is especially so when the evidence is given after a dispute has arisen. Evidence of the former type is immaterial. Evidence of the latter type will be tainted by the inevitable conscious and subconscious incentives to give evidence of past beliefs self-servingly, with the benefit of hindsight and to fit neatly within the legal requirements of each party’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Second, although it is true that contract formation is an event rather than a process, it is not always easy to say exactly when that event occurs in a fast-paced commercial negotiation involving multiple participants (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [40]). It is often the case that commercial entities continue their negotiations even after agreeing what they consider to be the essential terms of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis of the parties’ negotiations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I start my analysis of the March 2016 negotiations by concentrating on the negotiations from 15 March 2016 to 17 March 2016 (see [81]–[95] above). I will then consider the negotiations on 18 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In my view, Aragon’s phone call (see [81] above) and follow up email (see [84] above) on 15 March 2015 amounted to an offer by the respondents to the claimant. The terms of this offer were as follows: in exchange for the claimant resuming delivery of the Modules, the respondents would give the claimant an undertaking in the form of NDU-1 and assure the claimant that full payment for all Modules would be made upon the Project achieving commercial operation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Legolas did not accept this offer. But he did not reject it either. He clearly saw Aragon’s offer as a starting point for further negotiation. Legolas therefore said, as an initial indication, that he would need “the executed undertaking document for releasing the first shipment of modules … [and] the full payment for the current two shipments [of the Modules]”.

</div>
</div>
</div> He then followed up on 17 March 2016 by sending NDU-2 to Frodo (see [89] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 NDU-2 was the claimant’s counteroffer. The respondents accepted the claimant’s counteroffer save only for one term. That term was Legolas’s request to increase the shares in the third respondent which were to be subject to the first respondent’s non-disposal undertaking from 24% to 57%. But Gimli withdrew this request after Samwise explained to him why it could not be accepted (see [91] above). The claimant’s position was that all other terms of the counteroffer should be accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I find that, at this point and on the objective approach, there was an agreement on the basic or essential terms of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The respondents submit that the parties reached no agreement whatsoever, not even on basic or essential terms, on 17 March 2016. The respondents’ submission proceed as follows. The respondent’s conduct in sending NDU-3 to the claimant on 17 March 2016 (see [94] above) and the claimant’s conduct in sending NDU-4 to the respondents on 18 March 2016 (see [98] above) shows that no agreement had been reached even on basic or essential terms on 18 March 2016, let alone on 17 March 2016. Further, even on 18 March 2016, the claimant’s email sending NDU-4 to the respondents amounts to a rejection of the respondents’ offer by way of NDU-3 on 17 March 2016. It destroyed the respondent’s offer and rendered it incapable of acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I do not accept the respondents’ submissions for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 First, as I have said (see [59(b)] above), whether a contract has been formed is determined on the objective approach. The respondent’s considered response to the claimant’s counteroffer of 17 March 2016 was to reject only the increase in the shares to be subject to the non-disposal undertaking from 24% to 57%. Implicit in this is the respondents’ acceptance of all of the other terms of the claimant’s counteroffer. The claimant agreed to withdraw that single term from its counteroffer on 17 March 2016. In doing so, the claimant insisted that the respondents must accept all the other terms of its counteroffer. In response, the respondents did not qualify in any way their earlier acceptance of those other terms of the claimant’s counteroffer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 At the moment of Gimli’s email to Samwise on 17 March 2016, therefore, the parties had, on the objective approach, reached <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> on the basic or essential terms of their contract (<span class="font-italic">Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 68 at [103]). Even if the respondents at that time had already formed an intention to resile from the acceptance or to alter other terms of the claimant’s counteroffer – as they arguably did the next day in NDU-3 – that does not detract from my finding. When the claimant sent its email on 17 March 2016, any such intention on the respondents’ part would at best relate only to a subjective and privately held qualification or reservation. That cannot affect my finding, on the objective approach, that a contract was formed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Second, I do not accept the respondents’ submission that they resiled from their acceptance of the claimant’s counteroffer by sending NDU-3 to the claimant. On my findings, the respondents could not resile from their acceptance because they were already bound by a contract on basic or essential terms. That is so even if they subjectively believed at that time that no contract had been formed and that they were continuing to negotiate a contract yet to be formed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Further, NDU-3 did not in fact qualify the basic or essential terms agreed. The law recognises (see [59(g)] above) that parties may agree a set of basic or essential terms, thereby forming a contract at the moment of that agreement. The fact that the parties go on to agree other terms after that moment does not dissolve the contract which was formed when the basic or essential terms were agreed. If they wish to dissolve that contract, they must do so in accordance with the law of contract. It is not suggested that the emails which the parties exchanged on 18 March 2016 amount to any such dissolution of the contract on basic or essential terms already formed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Third, I find that none of the terms from NDU-2 which the respondents failed to incorporate into NDU-3 relate to the basic or essential terms agreed on 17 March 2016. I examine first Gimli’s email of 18 March 2016. It is true that Gimli protests that NDU-3 “is NOT what we both agreed on the phone”. But the email is not framed as a dissolution of a contract already formed. It is not even framed as a non-contractual disavowal of everything that has gone before it. Instead, Gimli makes clear that his complaint is confined to two amendments in NDU-2 which the respondents failed to carry through into NDU-3: the amendments to cll 2.2 and 2.3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Neither cl 2.2 nor cl 2.3, as amended by the claimant, is a basic or essential term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The amended cl 2.2 is not a basic or essential term. The effect of the claimant’s amendment to cl 2.2 was to give the claimant priority of payment out of any funds which the first respondent may raise from project finance lenders. It is true that this amendment changed the substantive content of an existing obligation in NDU-2. It is also true that Gimli initially insisted on the amended cl 2.2 being incorporated into the parties’ agreement. But the claimant’s own conduct thereafter demonstrates that this amendment was not a basic or essential term. When the claimant sent NDU-4 to the respondents later that day, the claimant itself abandoned the amendment and reinstated cl 2.2 to the version found in NDU-2. I therefore accept the claimant’s submission that Gimli’s decision not to insist on the amended cl 2.2 in NDU-4 establishes that this term was not a basic or essential term to either party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The amended cl 2.3 is also not a basic or essential term. Clause 2.3 governs when the obligations under the non-disposal undertaking come to an end. I accept the claimant’s submission that its proposed amendment to clause 2.3 goes only to the form in which this contractual obligation is recorded and not to the substance of this obligation. In both NDU-2 and NDU-3, the parties’ obligations under the non-disposal undertaking terminate when the claimant receives full payment for its unpaid invoices from the first respondent or the second respondent. The substance of this obligation is therefore unchanged from NDU-2 to NDU-3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The claimant’s amendment in NDU-4 to include three invoices additional to those listed in the annex to NDU-3 is also not a basic or essential term. As with the amended cl 2.3, the inclusion of these invoices is a matter of form rather than substance, purely for the avoidance of doubt. The inclusion merely clarified that the scope of the assurance of payment to the claimant covered these invoices. Even without this amendment, all of the invoices issued by the claimant to the Procurement Company came within the substantive obligations in NDU-3 as they fell due for payment. That is so whether or not they were expressly listed in the annex to NDU-3. Including these three invoices does not in any way affect the substance of the basic or essential terms agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Finally, I accept that the claimant’s conduct in releasing the Modules for the Project on 18 March 2016 was causally connected to the contract which the parties had reached on basic or essential terms. Indeed, I go further and find that the release amount to both performance of the contract and the consideration for the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I do not accept the respondents’ submission that the release of the Modules was unconnected to the March 2016 negotiations and was merely the result of a commercial decision by the claimant to deepen its relationship with the Rohan Group in anticipation of future business. This submission is not supported by any contemporaneous evidence. This submission also runs counter to the inherent probabilities and the commercial expectations. If the claimant decided on 13 March 2016 to withhold delivery of Modules for the Project to reduce its exposure to the risk of the Procurement Company defaulting on its payment obligations under the MSA, it makes no commercial sense for the claimant to do an about-face just five days later and increase its exposure to the Rohan Group by delivering more Modules without having obtained any payment for invoices already due and overdue and without any assurance of payment in the future. It makes even less sense for the claimant to do this unilaterally, without asking for or securing any benefit in return.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I therefore accept that the claimant released the Modules on 18 March 2016 in performance of its obligations under and as consideration for the contract concluded on basic or essential terms on 17 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 For the foregoing reasons, I accept the claimant’s submission that the parties concluded a basic and essential terms contract on 17 March 2016 and then on full terms on 18 March 2016. This conclusion means that there is a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The contract I have found incorporates NDU-3. Clause 9 of NDU-3 contains an agreement to arbitrate disputes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Although this was not put in issue by the respondents, I also accept that this arbitration agreement fulfils the formalities set out in s 2A of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The arbitration agreement is in writing. It appears in cl 9 of NDU-3, the written component of the contract (see ss 2A(3) and 2A(4) of the Act). The fact that the MDA is partly in words and partly by conduct is therefore not to the point. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Further, since the MDA incorporates NDU-3, cl 9 is part of the MDA (see s 2A(7) of the Act).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The claimant’s alternative submission is that, even if no contract was formed on 17 March 2016, NDU-3 was the respondents’ offer to the claimant in the terms set out in NDU-3 and Legolas accepted this offer on 18 March 2016. Given my finding in favour of the claimant on its primary submission, I need not consider its alternative submission.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties to the contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I come now to the second point which the claimant must establish in order to show that there is an arbitration agreement between itself and each respondent. This is the point as to the parties to the contract that I have found was concluded on 17 March 2016. This point turns on the authority of each of the participants in the March 2016 negotiations to bind the respondents.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The claimant does not have to establish this second point as against the first respondent.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  COV’s Defence at para 31, at Boromir’s 1st Affidavit at VB-2 at HB/A/6/158 at ABD Tab 2.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> That is because it is common ground that Boromir had the first respondent’s authority to participate in the March 2016 negotiations and to bind the first respondent to any contract that may arise as a result. Boromir also signed NDU-3 expressly for and on behalf of the first respondent. The first respondent therefore accepts that, if I find that the March 2016 negotiations did give rise to a contract, as I have, the first respondent is a party to that contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The second and third respondents, on the other hand, each submit that no person who participated in the March 2016 negotiations had any authority whatsoever to negotiate with the claimant on each of their behalf or to bind either of them to any contract that may have arisen as a result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 It is clear on the face of NDU-3, of course, that neither the second respondent nor the third respondent are signatories to NDU-3. But I consider that feature to be a point of form rather than a point of substance. It is true that a person who signs a contract containing an arbitration agreement is, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> at least, a party to the arbitration agreement (Gary B Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span>(Wolters Kluwer 2nd Ed, 2014) at pp 1521–1522). That is merely the application of a general point of contract law to the specific case of an arbitration agreement.  But it does not follow that a party who has <span class="font-italic">not</span> signed a contract containing an arbitration agreement is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a party to an arbitration agreement incorporated into that contract: “[t]he sterile formality of a signature is not always necessary in law to breathe life into contractual undertakings” (<span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [55]). More importantly, given my findings on the parties’ contract, only part of the contract is found in NDU-3. Accordingly, the fact that the second and third respondents are not signatories to NDU-3 is not conclusive as to whether they are parties to the contract of which NDU-3 forms a part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Indeed, in the course of oral submissions before me, counsel for the third respondent candidly conceded that if I were to find that Aragon had the authority, actual or apparent, to represent the third respondent in the March 2016 negotiations with the claimant, and to find that a contract arose out of those negotiations, then the third respondent would be bound by the contract despite not being a signatory to NDU-3. This must be correct in principle. Although counsel for the second respondent did not expressly make the same concession, it must be equally correct for the second respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Everything therefore turns on the issue of authority. I begin by briefly restating the law on actual authority. In <span class="font-italic">Hely</span><span class="font-italic">-Hutchinson v Brayhead Ltd</span> [1968] 1 QB 549 (“<span class="font-italic">Hely</span><span class="font-italic">-Hutchinson</span>”), Lord Denning MR (at 583) said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]ctual authority may be express or implied. It is <span class="font-italic">express</span> where it is given by express words, such as when a board of directors pass a resolution which authorises two of their number to sign cheques. It is <span class="font-italic">implied</span> when it is inferred from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case, such as when the board of directors appoint one of their numbers to be managing director. They thereby impliedly authorise him to do all such things as fall within the usual scope of that office. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In other words, there are two varieties of actual authority. The first variety is express actual authority. This arises where the principal has expressly conferred authority on the agent either orally or in writing (Tan Cheng Han SC, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span>”) at para 03.014). The second variety is implied actual authority. Implied actual authority may arise from the parties’ conduct and the circumstances of a particular case (<span class="font-italic">Alphire</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Pte Ltd v Law Chau Loon and another matter</span> [2020] SGCA 50 at [7]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another suit</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 788, Belinda Ang J (as she then was) endorsed the following (at [42]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Professor Reynolds in <span class="font-italic">Bowstead</span><span class="font-italic"> and Reynolds</span> on Agency (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2006) (“<span class="font-italic">Bowstead</span>”) describes, usual authority (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, implied actual authority) at para 3-024 in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An agent who is authorised to conduct a particular trade or business or generally to act for his principal in matters of a particular nature, or to do a particular class of acts, has implied authority to do whatever is incidental to the ordinary conduct of such trade or business, or of matters of that nature, or is within the scope of that class of acts, and whatever is necessary for the proper and effective performance of his duties; but not to do anything that is outside the ordinary scope of his employment and duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 While implied actual authority may arise where it is necessary for, or ordinarily incidental to, the agent’s express authority, it may also arise where the circumstances clearly show that the agent is intended to have the implied actual authority necessary to fulfil his responsibilities despite the lack of express actual authority to do so (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at paras 03.031, 03.033 and 03.036). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Hence, in <span class="font-italic">Biggerstaffe</span><span class="font-italic"> v Rowatt’s Wharf, Limited</span> [1896] 2 Ch 93, the managing director of a company caused it to borrow money and to grant security to the lender over its assets for the loan. The validity of the security was challenged on the basis that the managing director did not have the authority to grant security for loans to the company. The company’s articles of association authorised its directors to delegate all their powers to a managing director. But there was no evidence of any such delegation for this transaction. Despite this, the court held that the managing director did have implied authority to grant the security because, in granting security, he was doing something reasonably incidental to his office as managing director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Returning to the facts of this case, I accept that Boromir and Frodo had implied actual authority from the second respondent and the third respondent respectively to participate in the March 2016 negotiations and to bind those companies to the contract. Boromir was a director of the third respondent in March 2016 in addition to being a director of the first respondent.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I also find that Aragon also had authority to bind the second respondent and the third respondent, even though he was not a director of either company in March 2016. The second respondent and the third respondent argue that Aragon lacked any authority to bind either the second respondent or the third respondent because neither company had passed a directors’ resolution specifically authorising Aragon to represent it in the March 2016 negotiations. I do not accept this submission. The lack of a directors’ resolution establishes only that Aragon did not have actual express authority from either the second respondent or the third respondent to participate in the March 2016 negotiations on their behalf and to bind them to the contract which resulted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The absence of a directors’ resolution conferring express actual authority on Aragon does not address Aragon’s implied actual authority. I find that Aragon had implied actual authority to participate in the March 2016 negotiations on behalf of the second respondent and the third respondent and to bind each of them to the contract it gave rise to. I say this for two reasons. First, Boromir and Frodo, as directors of the second respondent and the third respondent respectively, participated in the March 2016 negotiations and remained silent while Aragon took the lead in these negotiations speaking for both the second respondent and the third respondent. Second, Aragon held a senior position in the Rohan Group as a result of which both the second respondent and the third respondent conferred implied authority on Aragon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The starting point in the analysis is to appreciate Aragon’s position within the Rohan Group. His position is telling as to the ambit of his authority. He was hired to establish the Rohan Group’s business operations in Gondor and was given the title of “President” of the Rohan Group’s operations in Gondor.

</div> His senior managerial role meant that Aragon had overall responsibility for supervising the Rohan Group’s activities in Gondor. This extended to overall responsibility for the second respondent and the third respondent.  Indeed, a member of the Rohan Group’s in-house legal team accepts in his affidavit that Aragon was a “senior leader” who was “near the top of the chain of command”. Aragon was therefore the person to whom most employees in the Rohan Group’s business in Gondor reported by virtue of his position.

Indeed, this was something which Aragon himself pointed out to Legolas when they spoke on 15 March 2016. That was when Aragon assured Legolas that the second respondent would pay the claimant once the third respondent managed to draw down the loans from the project financers (see [84(c)] above). The successful completion of the Project, on time and within budget, was Aragon’s responsibility. This must extend to resolving difficulties standing in the way of completing the Project on time and within budget, such as the claimant’s suspension of delivery of Modules for the Project. I am satisfied that the second respondent and the third respondent gave Aragon their implied express authority to move each of them in directions that he thought were in the best interests of the Rohan Group in order to complete the Project on time and within budget.

</div> does not fall within the terms of the submission to arbitration, whether in the notice of arbitration, in the claimant’s pleadings, in the terms of reference or in the list of issues. Instead, the case which the claimant submitted to arbitration was that the contract between the parties <span class="font-italic">was</span> NDU-3, a contract <span class="font-italic">in writing</span> concluded on <span class="font-italic">1</span><span class="font-italic">7</span> March 2016. The claimant submitted this dispute to arbitration in all of the claimant’s filings in the arbitration right up to and including the evidential hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 It was only <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">fter</span> the evidential hearing on 7 August 2020, that the claimant changed its case. This was when the claimant circulated its draft of the agreed list of issues as directed by the tribunal. This was the first time the claimant advanced a case that the parties had concluded a contract including <span class="font-italic">but not limited</span> to NDU-3 by words <span class="font-italic">and conduct</span> between 15 March 2016 and <span class="font-italic">18 March 2016</span>. Then, in its closing submissions, the claimant advanced a case based on a contract on full terms concluded by words or conduct on or by 18 March 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The claimant changed its case in this fundamental way without ever seeking leave to amend its pleaded case. The tribunal’s finding in favour of the claimant on this changed case was beyond its jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The matters submitted to arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The starting point in determining whether an arbitral tribunal has decided a matter not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or a matter that that goes beyond the scope of submission to arbitration is, quite obviously, to ascertain the scope of the submission to arbitration. I therefore begin the analysis with the notice of arbitration and then turn to consider the terms of reference, the parties’ pleadings which include the statement of claim, the statement of defence and the reply, the list of issues and the parties’ closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Before moving to consider each source in turn, I make four observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The first observation I make is on the relationship between a challenge on grounds of jurisdiction under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law and a challenge on the grounds of inability to present a case under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) or a breach of natural justice under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. The former type of challenge raises a fundamental issue. It engages at a general level the scope of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate and at a more specific level the scope of the individual submission to arbitration. Although the tribunal has the power to determine its own jurisdiction, it has no power (absent the parties’ agreement) to cure a lack of jurisdiction. In other words, a tribunal cannot expand its jurisdiction, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> take jurisdiction over a matter if it has found that matter to be outside its jurisdiction. The latter type of challenge, in contrast, raises a purely a procedural issue. It relates only to the manner in which the tribunal has conducted the arbitration. More importantly, until it is <span class="font-italic">functus</span>, it is entirely within the tribunal’s power to cure the ground for this challenge. Until it is <span class="font-italic">functus</span>, the tribunal can extend any accommodation necessary to address the latter type of challenge, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by allowing an adjournment, reopening discovery of documents, reopening the evidential phase and recalling witnesses, allowing further oral or written submissions or awarding costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The second observation I make is that ascertaining the terms or scope of a submission to arbitration is a holistic exercise, not a narrow mechanical or technical exercise (<span class="font-italic">CJA v CIZ</span> [2022] 2 SLR 557 at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he question of what matters were within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration would be answerable by reference to five sources: the parties’ pleadings, the list(s) of issues, opening statements, evidence adduced, and closing submissions at the arbitration. This was an elaboration of the principle that in considering whether the jurisdiction has been exceeded, <span class="font-italic">the court must look at matters in the round to determine whether the issues in question were live issues in the arbitration</span>. In doing so, <span class="font-italic">it does not apply an unduly narrow view of what the issues were: rather, it is to have regard to the totality of what was presented to the tribunal whether by way of evidence, submissions, pleadings or otherwise and consider whether, in the light of all that, these points were live</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A court should therefore not take an “unduly narrow view” of the terms or the scope of the submission to arbitration. The answer is, in all cases, a matter of substance rather than form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The third observation I make is that, when ascertaining the terms or the scope of a submission to arbitration, the parties’ pleadings are a convenient reference point but are by no means conclusive. The true objective of the exercise is to ascertain the limits of the dispute referred to arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Prometheus Marin</span><span class="font-italic">e Pte Ltd v King, Ann Rita and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 1 (at [58])):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 Furthermore, while pleadings in arbitral proceedings can provide a convenient reference point to determine the scope of an arbitrator’s jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is by no means limited by the pleadings because a practical view has to be taken regarding the substance of the dispute being referred to arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Counsel for the third respondent cites the case of <span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 768 (“<span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro</span>”), an earlier decision of mine. In that case, I considered the role of pleadings in civil litigation with reference to, amongst others, the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in <span class="font-italic">Loveridge, Loveridge v Healey</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 173 (at [23]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is on the basis of the pleadings that the parties decide what evidence they will need to place before the court and what preparations are necessary before the trial. Where one party advances a case that is inconsistent with his pleadings, it often happens that the other party takes no point on this. Where the departure from the pleadings causes no prejudice, or where for some other reason it is obvious that the court, if asked, will give permission to amend the pleading, the other party may be sensible to take no pleading point.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>Where, however, departure from a pleading will cause prejudice, it is in the interests of justice that the other party should be entitled to insist that this is not permitted unless the pleading is appropriately amended. That then introduces, in its proper context, the issue of whether or not the party in question should be permitted to advance a case which has not hitherto been pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 While I generally endorsed these principles as being equally applicable to arbitration, I did qualify my observations by adding that “the approach in arbitration to the rules of procedure, and in particular to the rules of pleading, is a pragmatic approach which looks to substance over form and fairness over technicality” (<span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro </span>at [177]). Indeed, and as I shall elaborate below, this is a point which I find to be especially important when dealing with the respondents’ submissions on this ground for setting aside this award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The final observation I make is that, although ascertaining the terms and scope of a reference to arbitration is a holistic exercise which strives to elevate substance over form, it is not a free for all. Purely as an analytical tool or a practical aid, it can be conceptualised as being governed by a series of four concentric circles of decreasing diameter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 First and foremost, a tribunal’s jurisdiction is determined by the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreement on its proper construction. Any attempt by the parties to submit to arbitration a dispute which does not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement must <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> fail. A dispute falling outside the scope of the arbitration agreement cannot, by definition, be within the terms or scope of a reference to arbitration under that agreement or within the jurisdiction of a tribunal constituted under that agreement. This circle usually poses no practical difficulty, at least in the modern context, for two reasons. First, the modern practitioners’ approach to arbitration agreements is to draft them very broadly so as to capture all classes of disputes which may arise under or be related to the contract in which the arbitration agreement is found. Second, the modern judicial approach to arbitration agreements is to interpret them like any other contractual term, and not to interpret them technically or with suspicion. They are now interpreted so as to uphold commercial expectations that arbitration is a one-stop mode of alternative dispute resolution (see <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corporation and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Privalov and others</span> [2007] 4 All ER 951 at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The second concentric circle is the notice of arbitration or the request for arbitration. It is in this document that the party commencing the arbitration identifies and describes the specific dispute between the parties which it is referring to arbitration for resolution. A notice of arbitration is also framed broadly. That is because it is drawn up at an early stage, without full knowledge of the facts or a full opportunity to examine the law, sometimes in circumstances of urgency, and without any means of foreseeing where the vagaries of dispute resolution will take the arbitration. While a notice of arbitration does serve to give the opposing party notice of the case it will have to meet in the arbitration, that is not its primary purpose. Its primary purpose, as I have said, is to identify and describe the dispute being referred to arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The third concentric circle comprises the parties’ pleadings. This includes a statement of claim, a statement of case or a complaint as well as the statement of defence and a reply, and the equivalent of each of these pleadings for any counterclaim. It is in the pleadings that each party states with specificity and particularity the facts necessary to establish the case which it advances in the arbitration, whether by way of claim, defence or counterclaim. While the parties’ pleadings play a role in delineating the tribunal’s jurisdiction, that is not the primary purpose of pleadings. The primary purpose of the pleadings is to give the opposing party reasonable notice of the case it will have to meet in the arbitration. Thus, if a matter falls outside the scope of the pleadings, that is some indication – although by no means conclusive – that it may be outside the scope of the tribunal’s jurisdiction. Whether it is in fact outside the scope of the tribunal’s jurisdiction will be determined by whether it comes within the scope of the arbitration agreement and the notice of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The fourth concentric circle comprises the other documents in the arbitration which set out what the tribunal must decide. Some of these documents are required by the applicable arbitration rules, such as the terms of reference in an ICC arbitration. Others are documents that the parties choose to file merely to assist the tribunal, such as opening statements, agreed or party lists of issues, closing submissions and post-hearing briefs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I have used the analogy of concentric circles of decreasing diameter because each circle is constrained by the one before it. A notice of arbitration cannot refer to arbitration a dispute which falls outside the arbitration agreement. A statement of claim should not plead a claim which falls outside the scope of the notice of arbitration. A closing submission should not generally (see [181] below) advance a case which falls outside the pleadings. This was in fact a point noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CAJ and another v CAI and another appeal</span> [2022] 1 SLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">CAJ</span>”) (at [50]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The appellants … argue that the dominant consideration in assessing the scope of the submission to arbitration is whether the parties had joined issue or directly clashed on the issue in question. … In our view, this argument was wholly misguided. … the five sources [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the parties’ pleadings, agreed list of issues, opening statements, evidence adduced, and closing submissions] … <span class="font-italic">are not discrete or independent sources</span>. It would not suffice for the purposes of determining the tribunal’s jurisdiction that the issue in question had been raised in any one of the five sources. <span class="font-italic">Instead, the overriding consideration is to determine whether the relevant issues had been properly pleaded before the tribunal</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 It is, of course, true that all of these documents play a role in ascertaining the scope of a tribunal’s jurisdiction. But it is the case that, strictly speaking, a tribunal’s jurisdiction is determined principally by the arbitration agreement and the notice of arbitration. It is the arbitration agreement which delineates the disputes that can be submitted to arbitration under it. If a dispute is outside that class, no tribunal can be constituted under that arbitration agreement to resolve it. It is the notice of arbitration which delineates the scope of the specific dispute which a claimant now refers to arbitration. If a dispute is outside the scope of the notice of arbitration, it will be outside the terms and scope of the reference to arbitration before a tribunal constituted as a result of that notice. Of course, it remains open to a claimant to refer that dispute to arbitration by a separate notice of arbitration.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 There is, however, an important distinction between the last two circles and the first two circles. The last two circles, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the parties’ pleadings and other documents filed in the arbitration, are within the control of the parties and the tribunal (once constituted). If a list of issues or a closing submission goes beyond the scope of a party’s pleading, it is open to that party to seek to amend the pleadings, and it is within the power of the tribunal to allow the application to amend, even if the opposing party withholds its consent. The first two circles, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the arbitration agreement and the notice of arbitration, are entirely outside the control of either the parties or the tribunal. If a notice of arbitration includes a claim which goes beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement, there is nothing that can be done. So too, if a pleading contains a claim which goes outside the scope of the notice of arbitration, there is nothing that the tribunal or the parties can do. All of this is, of course, subject to the universal solvent in arbitration which is bilateral consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Thus, the mere fact that an issue appears, for example, in a party’s closing submission but does not appear in that party’s pleadings does not necessarily mean that the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction if it determines that issue. The litmus test for whether an issue falls outside the terms or scope of a submission to arbitration is to ask whether the tribunal has the power to allow that party to amend its pleadings to incorporate the issue in the exercise of its procedural discretion (see <span class="font-italic">CAJ </span>at [40]). That in turn will require a consideration of the first two concentric circles. If the answer is yes, it cannot be said that the issue falls outside the terms or scope of the submission to arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 I now turn to consider the terms and scope of this reference to arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 There is no suggestion that the claimant’s case on the MDA which the tribunal accepted falls outside the scope of the arbitration agreement in cl 9 of NDU-3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 I therefore begin by assessing the scope of the notice of arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The notice of arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 The notice of arbitration is dated 11 April 2017.

</div> The dispute which the claimant referred to arbitration was not said to arise only out of NDU-3 as a contract, but also out of a contract <span class="font-italic">evidenced by</span> NDU-3. Further, the dispute which the claimant referred to arbitration does not only arise from NDU-3 but is also connected to NDU-3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In my view, the claimant framed the dispute which it referred to arbitration by its notice of arbitration sufficiently widely to encompass a partly oral and partly written contract arising out of the March 2016 negotiations and connected to or evidenced by NDU-3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The terms of reference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I turn next to the terms of reference. In an arbitration under the ICC Rules such as this arbitration, the terms of reference is a contractual instrument signed by the parties and the tribunal after the tribunal has been constituted. It assists the tribunal by allowing the tribunal to state, in clear terms, the scope of the dispute which the parties have referred to it for resolution. Given that it is the tribunal who drafts the terms of reference, albeit with the input of the parties, it is an accurate and detailed reflection of what the tribunal conceives as the issues which the parties have referred to it for determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The requirements for the terms of reference are prescribed by the ICC Rules. Article 23(1) of the ICC Rules states that an “arbitral tribunal shall draw up, on the basis of documents or in the presence of the parties and in the light of their most recent submissions, a document defining its terms of reference”. Articles 23(1)(c) and (d) of the ICC Rules require the terms of reference to contain “a summary of the parties’ respective claims and of the relief sought by each party, together with the amounts of any quantified claims and, to the extent possible, an estimate of the monetary value of any other claims” and “a list of issues to be determined” unless the tribunal considers it inappropriate. Of particular importance is Art 23(4) of the ICC Rules:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4) After the terms of reference have been signed or approved by the Court, no party shall make new claims which fall outside the limits of the terms of reference unless it has been authorized to do so by the arbitral tribunal, which shall consider the nature of such new claims, the stage of the arbitration and other relevant circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In other words, once the tribunal has drawn up the terms of reference, the parties are contractually bound not to raise new issues in the arbitration without the tribunal’s authorisation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The terms of reference in this arbitration are dated 10 April 2019.

In reliance on this agreement, the claimant released the Modules.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Paragraph 46 lists the relief which the claimant seeks. In particular, it notes that the claimant claims damages against the respondents for breach of their obligations “contained in and/or evidenced by” NDU-3, tracking the language of the notice of arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Paragraphs 47 to 66 record the respondents’ defences, in particular, their argument that no contract whatsoever exists with the claimant and, even if it does, that the second respondent and the third respondent are not parties to that agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The terms of reference record the claimant’s position that the obligations which it claims the respondents breached are “evidenced by” NDU-3. This is broad enough to encompass a case that the obligations arose before the respondents sent NDU-3 to the claimant. In fact, this line of reasoning is reflected in paragraphs 37 to 39 of the terms of reference, which describe how the parties entered into negotiations and reached “<span class="font-italic">an agreement</span>”, and that “<span class="font-italic">pursuant to</span> that agreement”, NDU-3 was issued in the claimant’s favour. Read this way, it becomes apparent that the terms of reference encompass a case, not only that the claimant’s contract with the respondents <span class="font-italic">was</span> NDU-3, but also that the parties’ contract may have been partly oral and concluded <span class="font-italic">before</span> the respondents sent NDU-3 to the claimant, albeit evidenced by NDU-3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 The claimant’s pleaded case in its statement of claim dated 1 July 2019 was consistent with its notice of arbitration and the terms of reference:

The claimant pleads the exact terms of this contract at paragraph 105. While most of the terms pleaded are drawn from the text of NDU-3, the claimant also pleads at paragraph 105(5) a term that the claimant would deliver the remaining Modules to the respondents. This term is found nowhere in the text of NDU-3. This again is consistent with the claimant’s case in the notice of arbitration and as recorded in the terms of reference that the parties’ contract was concluded by words and conduct.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At paragraph 106 of the statement of claim, the claimant pleads that the email correspondence on 17 March 2016 which culminated in NDU-3 “evidences the conclusion of a contract” between the parties. Thus, the claimant maintains the point that the contract it relies on is the result of the course of the parties’ negotiations on 17 March 2016 and was merely evidenced by, rather than consisted of, NDU-3. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At paragraph 117, the claimant pleads that the parties were unable to reach any further agreement on the non-essential terms, and that no agreement was reached about further changes to the contract, which in any event was concluded. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At paragraphs 142 to 146, the claimant pleads how each respondent breached its obligations under the contract. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) At paragraphs 150 to 152, the claimant pleads the heads of loss and damage that the respondents allegedly caused it to suffer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 The claimant’s statement of reply dated 13 September 2019 at paragraphs 21 to 23 reiterates its position that NDU-3 “evidences the contract and arbitration agreement concluded between the parties”.

Further, even if a contract was concluded, it was solely in the form of an NDU.

This was the respondents’ position even when they were given the opportunity to respond to the claimant’s closing submission in reply closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The tribunal’s findings fell within the scope of terms and scope of the submission to arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The documents canvassed above make it clear that, despite any differences in the form in which the claimant asserted its case in these documents, the central issue which the claimant submitted to the tribunal remained consistent from the notice of arbitration to the closing submissions, namely whether the March 2016 negotiations resulted in a concluded contract whose obligations are “contained in or evidenced by” NDU-3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Although jurisdiction is a fundamental issue, a court hearing a jurisdictional challenge should not adopt an overly technical or formal approach to ascertaining the scope of the submission to arbitration (see [77] above).

But that is a mere issue of form, not substance. The tribunal did not use this term to signify some departure from the central matter which the claimant had submitted to arbitration. The tribunal used this term as a convenient label in deciding the very matter which the claimant had submitted to arbitration, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the parties had concluded a contract “contained in or evidenced by” NDU-3. The tribunal referred to the MDA as consisting of oral and written terms. NDU-3 contained the written terms, as an appendage. The oral terms, on the other hand arose from the March 2016 negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The tribunal’s findings fell well within the terms and scope of the submission to arbitration, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, whether a contract was formed between the parties, and if so, the terms of that contract. Indeed, if one refers to, for instance, the claimant’s statement of claim, its pleaded case that the contract was concluded by “words and/or conduct” can be interpreted to mean that a contract was concluded from looking at the parties’ correspondence and conduct throughout March 2016 negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on excess of jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the tribunal’s holding that the parties’ concluded a contract called the “Modules Delivery Agreement, of which NDU-3 was an appendage”

Whereas a court may take a contrary view <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>, it should not be too ready to intervene (at [74]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As long as one argument resolves the issue, it is not necessary to insist that the arbitral tribunal go on to consider the other arguments which have been rendered academic. The rule of natural justice protects the right to be heard and not a right to receive responses to all the submissions or arguments presented (at [76]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Even if there was an inadequate provision of reasons by the tribunal, that is merely an error of law on the part of the tribunal. It is well recognised that the court normally does not intervene in an award under the Act on the basis of errors of law <span class="font-italic">per se,</span> and an allegation of inadequate reasons and explanations is therefore generally not capable of sustaining a challenge against an award (at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In particular, the following guiding factors are relevant in determining the adequacy of the reasons provided by the tribunal (at [103]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The standard of explanation required in every case must correspond to the requirements of the case. Costs and delays are relevant factors to consider when determining the extent to which reasons and explanations are to be set out in detail.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii)  There should be a summary of all the key relevant evidence but not all the detailed evidence needs to be referred to.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The parties’ opposing stance and the tribunal’s findings of fact on the material issues should be set out. However, the tribunal does not have to make an explicit ruling on each and every factual issue.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Ultimately, the crux is whether the contents of the arbitral award taken as a whole inform the parties of the bases on which the arbitral tribunal reached its decision on the material or essential issues; there is no requirement for the arbitral tribunal to touch on “each and every point in dispute” in its grounds of decision (at [104] and [105])</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondents’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 The respondents submit that the tribunal breached their right to a fair hearing and deprived them of a reasonable opportunity to be heard on three grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 The first ground relates to the tribunal’s decision to accept what the respondents allege was the claimant’s new case, without affording the respondents an opportunity to reopen the evidential inquiry and reorientate its focus according to that case (“the Notice Ground”). The respondents argue that by allowing the claimant to change its case at the eleventh hour <span class="font-italic">via</span> the list of issues, after the evidential phase and before closing submissions, the tribunal deprived the respondents of a reasonable opportunity to respond to that case. The respondents argue that the tribunal failed to invite or allow the respondents to adduce evidence, to cross-examine the claimant’s witnesses based on the new case, or at the very least, ask the respondents to respond to the claimant’s new case in their closing submissions and reply closing submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 The respondents further argue that it was because of this failure that they made submissions only on the claimant’s case that the parties had concluded a contract on 17 March 2016 in the form of NDU-3, rather than on the claimant’s new case. This resulted in respondents being deprived of their right to be heard on an issue which was crucial to the tribunal’s reasoning in the award. As a result, the award was based on a chain of reasoning that the respondents did not have a reasonable opportunity to address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 The second ground relates to the tribunal’s fact-finding decision regarding the loss and damage suffered by the claimant (“the Loss and Damage Ground”). The respondents argue that the tribunal made a factual finding that the quantum of loss and damage suffered by the claimant amounted to ₴7.35m despite the claimant’s failure to adduce specific evidence on the value of the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The tribunal’s reasons for valuing the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent which the first respondent had disposed of in breach of the MDA at ₴7.35m were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">218.  Further, [Legolas] also deposed paragraph 4 of his affidavit of 20 August 2016 that Exhibit 3R-6 (which was disclosed by [the third respondent]) refers to the SPA dated 26 September 2016 under which [the Procurement Company] and the non-Debtor owner/sellers agreed to transfer all the shares in the [Gondorian] entities to [the Sauron Group], and for [the Sauron Group] to pay about …[₴]38 million only to non-Debtor owner/sellers and (not [the Procurement Company]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">219. The Respondents have not denied [Legolas’s] testimony on these figures as set out paragraph 83(b) of his Witness Statement or his affidavit when he was cross-examined</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">220. It would appear from [Legolas’s] two statements that the Project was sold between ...[₴]32-38 million to [the Sauron Group]. Taking the lower figure, 24% of …[₴]32 million is …[₴]7,680.000, which already exceeds the amount of …[₴]7,348,403.10 claimed by [the claimant].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The respondents submit that the tribunal misinterpreted Legolas’s evidence in his witness statements. They took him to be saying that the price for the third respondent alone was ₴32m to ₴38m, whereas he was actually saying that that was the price for a number of companies only one of which was the third respondent. The respondents also rely on a host of other factual and logical errors which the tribunal allegedly made in quantifying the value of the shares in the third respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 At a more fundamental level, the respondents complain that the tribunal failed to give them an opportunity to lead evidence or make submissions on the issue of loss and damage, including the value of the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent. The respondents argue that there was evidence to show that Sauron Group paid only ₴1.09m for the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent.

In explaining that holding, I have analysed the claimant’s case and the respondents’ response to it from the notice of arbitration to the reply closing submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 That analysis shows two things. First, that the issue which the claimant advanced in its list of issues was an issue which fell within the terms and scope of the submission to arbitration. It was therefore open to the claimant to pursue that issue and for the tribunal to determine it, subject only to the respondents’ right to a reasonable opportunity to present their case on the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 It is perhaps true that the claimant did not plead this issue. But the claimant’s list of issues did no more than to make patent what had until then been latent in the claimant’s case. And the claimant’s list of issues made that issue patent with complete clarity. From that point forward, the respondents could no longer claim not to have reasonable notice of the case they had to meet on this issue. Second, even at that late stage, it was possible for the respondents to engage with that issue. Instead, the respondents decided to take the all-or-nothing position that the issue fell outside the terms or scope of the submission to arbitration. Further, at no time did the respondents take the point that it would be a breach of their right to a fair hearing for the tribunal to entertain and decide the issue in its award. As a result, the respondents chose to stand or fall on this issue on the jurisdictional point. They chose not to ask the tribunal to grant them an accommodation in order to allow them a reasonable opportunity to deal with the issue, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by asking the tribunal to require the claimant to amend its formal pleadings, by asking the tribunal to reopen the evidential phase (if there was a basis to do so), by asking the tribunal to allow them more time for their written closing submissions (again, if there was a basis to do so) or by dealing with this aspect of the claimant’s case in its closing submissions without prejudice to its jurisdictional objection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 What happened in this arbitration is not that the tribunal deprived the respondents of a reasonable opportunity to be heard on this issue. What happened is that the respondents took a tactical decision to press on with their closing submissions without addressing this issue, despite having had sufficient and reasonable notice of it, hoping that the tribunal would uphold the jurisdictional objection. That is, of course, a tactical decision which was open to the respondents. Having made their tactical bed, however, they must now lie in it. The tribunal did not deprive the respondents of a reasonable right to be heard on this issue. The respondents renounced that right in favour of a jurisdictional objection. It therefore cannot be said that a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal would have notice of the respondents’ grievance, and certainly cannot be faulted for not giving the respondents the opportunity to re-open the evidential inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 I therefore do not accept that the Notice Ground establishes a breach of the rules of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Loss and Damage Ground</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 The grounds for setting aside an award must be construed and applied bearing in mind the very strong policy imperative from treaty, legislation and precedent of minimal curial intervention in arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at [65(c)]). It is therefore axiomatic that a party cannot challenge an award on the ground that the tribunal made an error in its findings of fact or its holdings of law. The court does not sit as an appellate court to re-examine the tribunal’s award on its merits (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span>at [2]). It follows that a party cannot dress up what is in substance a complaint that a tribunal made an error of fact or law as a complaint that the tribunal failed to give that party a reasonable opportunity to present its case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 Insofar as the respondents seek to set aside the award on the basis that the tribunal fell into error in its quantification of loss and damage, that is a non-starter. Indeed, I find that all of these arguments amount in substance to nothing more than an argument that the tribunal erred in its findings of fact. That is not a valid ground of challenge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 In any event, it is not open to the respondents to allege that it did not have a reasonable opportunity to address the reasoning which the tribunal ultimately adopted on the Loss and Damage Ground. It was obvious from the outset that there was a dispute as to quantum. The respondents do not say otherwise. There is a clear nexus between the value of the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent and the quantification of the claimant’s loss and damage. Those shares were, after all, the subject matter of the non-disposal undertaking. Any evidence that would assist the tribunal in valuing the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent is therefore evidence which is relevant to the matters before the tribunal. Indeed, the third respondent itself admitted that there was evidence which was directly relevant to the issue of valuing the first respondent’s shares in the third respondent. Yet it failed to bring this evidence to the tribunal’s attention, or to adduce any material evidence that would have assisted the tribunal in this aspect. Indeed, the tribunal observed as much:

So was the price. However, [the first respondent] has not disclosed the SPA. What it has disclosed is a copy of the Securities Transfer Form dated 27 October 2016 executed by [the first respondent] to transfer its 99.99% shares in [the third respondent]. Although the transfer form has two boxes for the consideration (sale price) to be stated in words and in figures, the copy disclosed omitted the consideration paid for the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 While the third respondent sought to rationalise its failure to do so on the basis that the claimant had not discharged its burden of proving that the wrongful disposal of the shares in the third respondent had caused loss and damage, and there was therefore no dispute, I find that to be a disingenuous invocation of parties’ respective burdens of proof. The respondents seek to criticise the tribunal’s conduct for something that they themselves have not seen fit to put before the tribunal for consideration. Having failed to bring to the tribunal’s attention the existence of such evidence that could shed light on the quantification of the third respondent shares, it does not now lie in the respondents’ mouth to say that the tribunal had not afforded them an opportunity to present their case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Accordingly, I find that there is no breach of natural justice on the Loss and Damage Issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Key Arguments Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 Contrary to the respondents’ submission that the tribunal failed to consider several of its arguments, I find that the tribunal demonstrated its attempts to engage with and apply its mind to the respondents’ case on those issues.

What matters is that the award gives sufficient reasons to inform the parties as to the bases which the tribunal has reached its decision (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> at [104] and [105]). To this end, it is sufficient that a court cannot infer that the tribunal has failed to consider an argument or issue where the tribunal has explicitly indicated in the award that it has considered that issue or argument (<span class="font-italic">CIX</span><span class="font-italic"> v CIY </span>[2021] SGHC 53 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 In any event, the tribunal expressly considered some of the respondents’ submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  In relation to the submission that the claimant’s decision to release the Modules was a commercial decision and not causally connected to a contract with the claimant, the tribunal expressly considered this argument.
