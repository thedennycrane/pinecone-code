<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involves an appeal
                    and a cross-appeal against an assessment of damages in a
                    personal injury case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 15 June 2006, the
                    plaintiff, Mdm Tan Juay Mui, who was then almost 48, was
                    knocked down by a bus driven by the first defendant. The
                    second defendant is the employer of the first defendant.
                    After proceedings were commenced, the defendants consented
                    to judgment being entered against them for damages to be
                    assessed on the basis that they were fully responsible for
                    the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Initially, the plaintiff
                    suffered the following serious injuries:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     A severe injury
                        to her left foot with an extensive section of her skin
                        torn off the underlying tissue, severing the blood
                        supply; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Severe brain injury with blood
                        collecting between the layers of the
                    brain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">She was admitted to hospital and
                    underwent emergency surgery to remove the blood in the
                    brain. A right intracranial pressure monitor was inserted in
                    her head during the operation because her condition had
                    deteriorated and the size of the haematoma had increased.
                    Due to the serious nature of the injury to her left foot, it
                    could not be saved despite extensive wound debridement and,
                    on 17 June 2006, the plaintiff underwent an amputation
                    of her left leg below the knee in order to save her
                    life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I will detail the further
                    treatments administered to the plaintiff and her subsequent
                    complaints and ailments later in this judgment. It is
                    important to note here, however, that the plaintiff lost her
                    ability to manage herself and her affairs and her husband
                    had to be appointed her litigation representative to
                    undertake and conduct the proceedings on her
                behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below and appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After a lengthy hearing,
                    Assistant Registrar Ang Feng Qian
                    (“the AR”) made the following awards of
                    damages in favour of the plaintiff:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendants’ appeal
                    is for the awards for pain and suffering, special damages
                    and future expenses to be reviewed downwards to more
                    reasonable sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Medical Evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Five medical experts gave
                    evidence on behalf of the plaintiff. They were
                    Dr Pauline Sim Li Ping, a psychiatrist, Ms Zena
                    Kang, a clinical psychologist, Dr Karen Chua, a
                    rehabilitation specialist doctor, Dr Ernest Wang,
                    a neurosurgeon, and Dr Lee Chung Horn, an
                    endocrinologist. There were also two doctors who testified
                    for the defendants, Dr R Nagulendran, a
                    psychiatrist and Dr Lee Soon Tai, an orthopaedic
                    surgeon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       According to the medical
                    reports, when the plaintiff was first admitted, urgent CT
                    scans of her brain showed an acute right frontal subdural
                    haematoma with multiple hemorrhagic contusions in the right
                    frontal and right temporal lobes without skull fracture.
                    Dr Wang noted that subsequent to her arrival at the
                    hospital, the plaintiff’s condition deteriorated
                    neurologically. A decision was therefore made for a surgical
                    decompression of the acute subdural hematoma with the
                    insertion of an intracranial pressure monitor. This was done
                    on the day of her admission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequent to her
                    treatment for bleeding and swelling in the brain and the
                    amputation of her left leg, the plaintiff’s recovery
                    was complicated by sepsis (bacterial infection of the blood
                    stream), low blood pressure, coagulopathy and right-sided
                    posterior and anterior celebral artery and occipital lobar
                    infarction due to increased intracranial pressure which
                    resulted in paralysis of the left side of her body. Due to
                    prolonged artificial ventilation and ICU care, she required
                    an operation to cut open her throat for a tube to be
                    inserted to help her breathe. This was done on 21 June
                    2006. She was transferred to the general ward the next day
                    but was unable to speak or obey commands. On 30 June
                    2006, the plaintiff was transferred for in-patient brain
                    injury rehabilitation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital
                    Rehabilitation Centre. On 31 July 2006, she was
                    transferred to Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital for further
                    rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the time the plaintiff
                    entered the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Rehabilitation Centre,
                    she was found to be in a post-traumatic amnesiac state with
                    significant retrograde amnesia, impaired orientation and
                    poor short-term memory. She could not move her left upper
                    and lower limbs and could not see things on her left side.
                    She also had left-sided phantom limb pain. She was
                    incontinent of urine. The vision in her left eye was
                    impaired with a dark patch in the visual
                field.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After spending almost two
                    months in hospital, the plaintiff was discharged from Ang Mo
                    Kio Community Hospital on 7 September 2006.
                    Subsequently, she was readmitted to hospital for a titanium
                    cranioplasty to cover the defect in her skull. This
                    operation took place on 22 November 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff’s
                    husband testified that shortly after the accident, the
                    plaintiff was unable to recognise him and the family and
                    could not recall what had happened. About three weeks later,
                    she was able to talk but could not remember many things.
                    When she became aware of her amputation and paralysis, she
                    became very upset. In the following months she continued to
                    be depressed. After she returned home, she had difficulty
                    sleeping and was often frustrated and depressed about her
                    condition. She was embarrassed about her incontinence,
                    appearance (sunken head, amputated leg, paralysis,
                    blindness) and helplessness. The family noticed personality
                    changes and that she suffered from delusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In May 2007, the
                    psychologist in Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital noticed that
                    the plaintiff had paranoid delusions about her maid.
                    Subsequently, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Sim. In
                    her report of June 2008, Dr Sim noted that the
                    plaintiff was depressed and suicidal, and that she was
                    suffering from post-traumatic personality changes as a
                    result of her traumatic brain injury. Her depression was
                    secondary to the loss of her left lower leg, her immobility
                    and stroke that she had suffered. Dr Sim noted that the
                    plaintiff’s husband was her main caregiver as she was
                    suspicious of, and abusive towards, her maids. Subsequently,
                    in May 2009, Dr Sim examined the plaintiff again and
                    reported that her cognitive function had deteriorated. The
                    plaintiff still suffered from post-traumatic personality
                    change and had paranoid delusion and persecutory ideas. The
                    plaintiff was incapable of managing herself and her
                    financial affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Ms Zena Kang conducted a
                    psychometric assessment of the plaintiff. In her report of
                    12 May 2009, she concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
                        plaintiff’s skills in solving non verbal problems,
                        in working quickly and efficiently with visual
                        information, were classified as being “Extremely
                        Low”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     her skills in understanding verbal
                        information, verbal reasoning and expressing thoughts in
                        words were ranked in the ninth percentile, which means
                        that her score was better than only 9% of individuals
                        her age – “Extremely
                    Low”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     her performance on the Working Memory
                        Index was classified as “Low Average” to
                        “Average”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     although the
                        plaintiff’s scores on some of the non-verbal
                        (performance) subtests would have been affected by her
                        visual difficulties, there were other subtests, both
                        verbal and non-verbal that indicated that she had
                        difficulties with both concrete and abstract reasoning,
                        logical sequencing etc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Dr Karen Chua was in
                    charge of the plaintiff’s rehabilitation. In August
                    2006, she reported that comprehensive rehabilitation for the
                    plaintiff’s major disabilities of traumatic brain
                    injury and left limb amputation had been started. In March
                    2007, she reported that the plaintiff had developed late
                    scar epilepsy with a fall in February 2007. The plaintiff
                    had low mood and irritability but was not suicidal. She was
                    wheelchair bound. Her residual hemiplegia post brain injury
                    remained dense. She also had prolonged secondary amenorrhea
                    (loss of menstruation). Dr Chua started the plaintiff
                    on antidepressants and anti-seizure medications and
                    recommended that they were to be maintained for a minimum of
                    one year. By October 2007, Dr Chua was able to report
                    that the plaintiff was able to ambulate with minimal
                    assistance using a quad stick and a transtibial prosthesis.
                    She had some motor recovery for the left upper limb but
                    there was severe loss of upper limb dexterity and grip
                    strength. Her residual limb was mature and relatively pain
                    free. She continued to require antidepressants and
                    psychological counselling for treatment of her post
                    traumatic brain injury related depression with organic
                    delusional disorder and generalised anxiety. Routine testing
                    revealed new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus in October
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When Dr Chua came to court
                    in March 2011, she reported that she had last examined the
                    plaintiff on 13 January 2011. She was informed by the
                    plaintiff’s husband that the plaintiff had recently
                    been admitted to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in a
                    diabetic coma. Dr Chua was able to verify from her
                    records that the plaintiff had been admitted on
                    10 December 2010 and diagnosed as having diabetic
                    ketoacidosis as a result of which she had required intensive
                    care. Upon discharge, her medications for diabetes were
                    intensified and she required injections of insulin,
                    something that had not been required previously. Other than
                    that, in January 2011, the plaintiff was observed to be
                    continuing to maintain her previous functional levels. She
                    was still able to walk around the home with the assistance
                    walking frame and the prosthetic left limb. She also
                    continued to need minimal assistance with her daily
                    activities and living. Her mental state was quite stable and
                    her husband’s report was that her behaviour was under
                    control with the medication that she was taking. Her motor
                    control in her upper limbs was fairly intact and the left
                    leg still had reduced motor power but without significant
                    deterioration over the preceding six months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Dr Lee Chung Horn was
                    called as an expert on diabetes to testify as to whether the
                    plaintiff’s diabetic condition was the result of the
                    accident. I will discuss this evidence later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff also adduced
                    the reports of Dr Jeanne Ogle, the senior resident
                    ophthalmologist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In her report of
                    11 March 2009, she noted that the plaintiff had a right
                    occipital infarct which manifested visually as a left
                    homonymous hemianopia. This meant that when she watched
                    television, the left side of the television screen would be
                    obscured and her field of vision would be significantly
                    reduced. She still had navigational vision but the left
                    homonymous hemianopia meant that she was unable to see
                    objects on her left side and might bump into people or
                    things as she moved around.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Dr R Nagulendran, a senior
                    consultant psychiatrist, examined the plaintiff in September
                    and October 2010. For the purpose of this examination, he
                    was given copies of the reports of Dr Karen Chua,
                    Dr Ernest Wang, Dr Jeanne Ogle
                    (ophthalmologist from Tan Tock Seng Hospital), Dr Sim
                    Li Ping, Ms Chloe Seow of Ozworks Therapy and
                    Dr K H Ho, a neurologist. Dr Nagulendran
                    stated in his report that on examination, the plaintiff was
                    rational and relevant in her speech. She did not have any
                    thought disorder and did not express any delusion or
                    hallucination. She was calm and did not show any apparent
                    anxiety or depression. She was correctly orientated to time,
                    place and person. Her attention and concentration were
                    impaired. Her memory function was also impaired. She was
                    unable to recall the accident and the events following it.
                    She was then being assisted by her husband and her maid in
                    attending to her daily needs. She was able to take her food
                    herself and attend to her toilet needs but needed help to
                    get into her wheelchair and to fit her prosthesis. Her sleep
                    was normal and her appetite was good.</p>

                    appointed by the defendants to do a review of the plaintiff
                    and to opine on what future medical treatment and care she
                    would need. He was supplied with numerous reports from the
                    other specialists who had seen the plaintiff. He examined
                    the plaintiff on 30 August 2010. She was accompanied by
                    her husband and her domestic helper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal against award for pain and
                suffering</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Head injuries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The AR found that though
                    the plaintiff’s brain damage prevented her from
                    returning to the normal activities of daily living, the
                    injury was less serious than that suffered in cases where an
                    injured person ended up in a permanent vegetative state. She
                    noted that the award for the injury would not be only for
                    pain and suffering but also for loss of amenities and
                    pointed out that a person who was in a permanent vegetative
                    state would have a much greater loss of amenities than the
                    plaintiff in this case. She considered that the seriousness
                    of the injury and pain and suffering here was greater than
                    that in <em>Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation
                        representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 371 (“<em>Lee
                        Wei Kong</em>”) where the victim made a
                    good recovery and was awarded $160,000. However, in
                        <em>Ramesh </em><em>s/o Ayakanno </em><em>(suing by
                        the committee of the person and the estate, Ramiah
                        </em><em>Naragatha
                        </em><em>Vally) v Chua Gim

                        (“<em>Ramesh</em>”)
                    where the victim was left unable to move or talk and with a
                    shortened life expectancy of ten years, he was awarded
                    $185,000. The AR considered the injuries in <em>Ramesh</em> more serious than in the
                    present case. She decided that the plaintiff here would be
                    entitled to an award which was in between the figures in
                        <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> and
                        <em>Ramesh</em> and therefore came
                    to a figure of $170,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendants repeated
                    their submission made before the AR that the correct figure
                    for the head injury would be $70,000. Although the plaintiff
                    had suffered brain injuries, she had not suffered any skull
                    fractures. The defendants cited nine cases of brain injuries
                    (including <em>Ramesh</em> and
                        <em>Lee Wei Kong</em>) and pointed
                    out that in all but two of the cases the injured party had
                    suffered moderate to extensive facial/skull fractures in
                    addition to the brain injuries. The only decisions where
                    brain injuries were suffered without extensive fractures
                    were <em>Teo Seng Kiat v Goh
                        </em><em>Hwa Teck</em> [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 333 (“<em>Teo Seng
                        Kiat</em>”) and <em>Ang Siam
                        Hua v Teo Cheng Hoe</em> [2004] SGHC 147
                        (“<em>Ang Siam
                    Hua</em>”). The plaintiff in <em>Teo Seng Kiat</em> suffered right extradural and
                    parietal subdural haematomas with residual mild right
                    hemiparesis. His verbal memory and complex calculation
                    skills were impaired and there was a 20% permanent
                    disability in respect of his high level cognitive functions.
                    He was awarded $90,000. In <em>Ang Siam
                        Hua</em>, there was a head injury with contusion
                    of the right temporal lobe and resulting memory impairment
                    and post traumatic epilepsy. The plaintiff was awarded
                    $50,000 for the head injury and this award took into
                    consideration the fact that the plaintiff had been in a coma
                    for 16 days after the injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendants also relied
                    on the decision of <em>Tan Yu Min Winston (by
                        his next friend Tan Cheng Tong) v Uni-Fruitveg Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 825 where the
                    injured plaintiff was awarded $90,000. He had suffered
                    multiple lacerations over his face with multiple nasal bone
                    fractures and an obital bone fracture. He had a left
                    temporal extradural haematoma with subdural and traumatic
                    subarachnoidale haematoma and brain oedema and brain
                    contusion. His eyes were injured resulting in frequent
                    tearing and poor vision. As a consequence of the injury, the
                    plaintiff had slowed processing and impaired memory
                    retrieval. He had agitated depression and problems with
                    anger management and he had suffered residual cognitive and
                    behavioural deficits following the severe head injury. On
                    assessment, the AR awarded a total figure of $90,000 for the
                    collective injuries to the head region. On appeal (at
                        [21]), Chan Seng
                    Onn J increased the award for pain, suffering and loss
                    of amenities to $173,000 made up as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In his submissions arguing
                    for an award in the region of $280,000 (inclusive of
                    diabetes which he separately quantified as being $50,000),
                    counsel for the plaintiff emphasised that even if the injury
                    appears identical, each case has to be looked at with regard
                    to its particular overall circumstances (see <em>Peh Diana and another v Tan Miang
                        Lee</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 22). Counsel
                    also stressed the observations of Choo Han Teck J in
                        <em>Chong </em><em>Hwa Yin (committee of person and estate of Chong
                        </em><em>Hwa Wee, mentally

                        [5], [7] and [9]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>more severe the injury, the
                            more difficult it becomes to place a monetary value
                            to it.</em> In cases such as Eddie Toon and
                        the present case, we can, perhaps agree that only a sum
                        so low as $10,000 would be thought paltry and
                        insufficient, and although one might readily agree that
                        a sum of, say, $10,000,000 would be satisfactory, one
                        would, nonetheless, hesitate to conclude that that would
                        be the “correct”, or even fair,
                        compensation for pain and suffering the injured endured.
                            <em>It is also relevant to note that
                            compensation for pain and suffering is predominantly
                            the compensation for the pain and suffering endured
                            while it lasts. What sort of pain is felt and how
                            long it lasts depends on the facts of each
                            case.</em> This is why it is artificial to
                        treat loss of amenities as a separate head for pain and
                        suffering. Hence, a person who is brain dead feels no
                        pain while a quadriplegic, who is fully alert, suffers
                        the pain and frustration of a life without
                        participation, and such a pain is not only of the
                        deepest, it also lasts as long as his mind lasts.

                            the plaintiff was conscious of the pain or
                            suffering.</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis counsel’s]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff noted that
                    in <em>Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin
                        Hon</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 536
                        (“<em>Eddie
                    Toon</em>”), the plaintiff, a 7 year old boy,
                    was awarded $160,000 for pain and suffering and loss of
                    amenities. He suffered severe brain damage; he was paralysed
                    on the right side and had intermittent involuntary movements
                    of various parts of the body and needed to take
                    anti-epileptic drugs for life. He was unable to speak and
                    needed assistance to micturate and defecate and had the
                    intellectual ability of a 1 year old child. The plaintiff
                    submitted that an award of this amount would be too low for
                    the plaintiff because unlike Eddie Toon, who had minimal
                    awareness, the plaintiff was fully aware of her disabilities
                    and suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts as a
                    result of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff
                    distinguished <em>Ramesh</em>
                    ($185,000) and <em>Chen Qingrui v Phua
                        </em><em>Geok </em><em>Leong</em> (Suit No 937 of 2000) on the
                    same basis. Unlike the plaintiff, neither the injured person
                    in <em>Ramesh</em> or in <em>Chen Qingrui</em> remained mentally
                    active and alert. In the latter case, a 18 year old woman
                    was awarded $165,000 for brain injury. She had generalised
                    spasticity and minimal awareness; she was blind and unable
                    to speak. The plaintiff on the other hand was conscious of
                    her disfigurement and avoided friends and colleagues and it
                    was submitted that her suffering was of the deepest kind and
                    would last as long as her mind lasts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This argument, that the
                    plaintiff’s suffering was greater than those of
                    accident victims who had lost their awareness, was rejected
                    by the AR. She was of the view that the Court of Appeal had
                    indicated that the greatest loss of amenities would be
                    suffered by victims who entered a vegetative state. In
                        <em>Tan Kok Lam (next friend to Teng Eng)
                        v Hong Choon Peng</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 786, Chao Hick Tin had said (at [28]) that “there
                    is no greater injury or loss, as far as a living person is
                    concerned, than to be turned into a
                cabbage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, it should be
                    noted that the Court of Appeal was in that passage dealing
                    with the quantification of an award for loss of amenities.
                    It was rebutting the argument that because the plaintiff
                    there could no longer appreciate any loss due to her
                    unconsciousness, the sum awarded for pain and suffering and
                    loss of amenities should be moderate. Counsel for the
                    defendant there had argued that just as no damages are
                    allowed for pain and suffering which is not felt, similarly
                    no damages shall be allowed for loss of amenities which is
                    also not felt. The Court rejected that argument and to
                    appreciate its reasons for doing so, it is helpful to set
                    out the entirety of [28] of its judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We recognise and accept that for a claim for pain and
                        suffering, unconsciousness on the part of the victim
                        would negative that claim and thus render an award in
                        respect of that claim inappropriate. A claim for pain
                        necessarily suggests that the victim has consciousness,
                        otherwise there is no question of him enduring any pain
                        for which he should be compensated. However, the same
                        cannot be said for loss of amenities. Whether or not
                        there is loss of amenities is an objective fact. It
                        cannot and should not depend on an appreciation of the
                        loss by the victim. Perhaps the point can be better
                        illustrated by a simple example, where in an accident
                        the victim not only loses a leg, he also loses his
                        mental faculty. Are we to say that because the victim
                        cannot appreciate his present condition, no substantive
                        award should be made even for the loss of the leg? We
                        should think not. Has he not lost the ability to move
                        about freely, even with the help of an artificial limb?
                        And if a substantive award should be made for the loss
                        of the leg, why should it be otherwise for the complete
                        loss of the mental faculty? While it might be thought
                        that we are treading on dangerous ground to make
                        comparisons between injuries, we think there is no
                        greater injury or loss, as far as a living person is
                        concerned, than to be turned into a cabbage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, what the Court of Appeal was saying was that
                    the greatest loss of amenities that a living person can
                    suffer was to be put into a vegetative state and such loss
                    must be properly compensated although the sufferer would not
                    be entitled to a substantial award for pain and suffering
                    due to his inability to feel the same. The Court of Appeal
                    was not dealing with the situation where the injured person
                    could still move around and still suffer pain and appreciate
                    his physical limitations. Therefore, I do not think that the
                    reasoning there supports the conclusion drawn by the AR, to
                    wit, that the award for pain and suffering and loss of
                    amenities in respect of a person who is not in a vegetative
                    state must always be for less than the amount awarded to the
                    unconscious victim. After all, unlike the case before the
                    Court of Appeal where only an award for loss of amenities
                    was being made, pain and suffering being out of the
                    equation, in a case where all three elements are present the
                    particular facts may very well justify a higher
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff also relied
                    on <em>TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea
                        Heidi and another appeal</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 543 (“<em>De
                        Cruz</em>”) and <em>Tan Hun
                        Hoe v Harte Denis Mathew</em> [2001]
                    3 SLR(R) 414 (“<em>Harte</em>”) both of which were cases
                    which did not involve brain injuries. The plaintiff in
                        <em>De Cruz</em> lost the use of
                    her liver at 27 and had to undergo a liver transport. As a
                    result, she was susceptible to illnesses and the risk of
                    liver failure. She was awarded $150,000 in 2004. In
                        <em>Harte</em>, botched medical
                    treatment made it very unlikely that the plaintiff would be
                    able to father any children. The Court of Appeal awarded him
                    damages of $120,000 in 2001. The plaintiff argued that the
                    injuries in <em>Harte</em> and
                        <em>De Cruz</em> were less severe
                    than those that she had suffered. <em>Harte</em> did not seem to have difficulties with
                    activities of daily living whilst <em>De
                        Cruz</em> was able to resume more of a normal life
                    than the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff argued, the
                    award to her should be increased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Ramesh</em>, the court was also referred to
                        <em>De Cruz</em> and <em>Harte</em>. Kan Ting Chiu J, in
                    arriving at his decision, made the following comments at
                        [8]-[9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    Of the cases cited, <em>Hori, Toon</em> and <em>Chen</em> are brain damage cases.
                                <em>Hori</em> offers little
                            guidance as the extent of the brain damage is not
                            described. The injuries suffered in <em>Toon</em> and <em>Chen</em>, although not identical to
                            those suffered by the plaintiff here (such injuries
                            are rarely identical), are comparable in that they
                            left the subjects in a semi-vegetative state,
                            dependent on the assistance of others. While
                                <em>De Cruz</em> and
                                <em>Harte</em> are not
                            brain injury awards, they are relevant as indicators
                            of the levels of severity of injuries and
                            disabilities for which awards of $150,000 and
                            $120,000 have been made by the Court of Appeal. They
                            are also recent awards of 2004, whereas the brain
                            damage awards are older.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    Reviewing the cases, I am of the
                            view that the $170,000 award is low, being only
                            $5,000 higher than the 2001 award in <em>Chen</em>, and $10,000 higher
                            than the 1993 award in <em>Toon</em>, and when compared with the
                            awards of $120,000 and $150,000 for the testicular
                            injury in <em>Harte</em> and
                            liver injury in <em>De
                                Cruz</em> respectively which are
                            significantly less severe than the injuries suffered
                            by the plaintiff. I will increase this award to
                            $185,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Considering all the cases
                    that have been cited, I am of the view that the fact that
                    the plaintiff did not suffer any fractures of the skull does
                    not mean that the award should be reduced. The
                    plaintiff’s brain injuries were severe and the
                    treatment that she had to undergo was prolonged and
                    intensive. She needed operations on her brain and while she
                    may not have had the initial pain of the skull fractures,
                    she definitely experienced pain from the procedures that
                    were carried out on her skull. Apart from the prolonged
                    treatment for her brain injury, the plaintiff suffered loss
                    of vision, extensive scarring and paralysis. She also lost
                    substantial use of her upper left limb and needed extensive
                    rehabilitation to regain the ability to use it. In all these
                    aspects, she appears to me to have suffered more intensively
                    than the plaintiffs in the brain injury cases cited by the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is also the effect
                    on the plaintiff’s cognitive abilities and her
                    personality. Both psychiatrists were agreed that the
                    plaintiff’s cognitive abilities had been impaired by
                    her brain injuries and that the deficits were permanent.
                    Where they differed was in relation to depression and
                    personality changes. As far as depression was concerned,
                    there is no challenge to Dr Sim’s evidence that
                    the plaintiff did suffer from depression at the time she was
                    seen by Dr Sim. However, Dr Sim last saw her on
                    6 May 2009 and Dr Nagulendran saw her for the
                    first time on 17 September 2010. By that time, the
                    plaintiff no longer exhibited signs of depression. This may
                    have been because she had been placed on antidepressant
                    drugs. Dr Nagulendran also testified that she did not
                    have personality changes. However, his evidence on this
                    aspect was less convincing since he did not see her over a
                    period of time. In this respect, the evidence of Dr Sim
                    and the plaintiff’s husband who was aware of her
                    pre-accident personality and had constant contact with her
                    after the accident must be preferred. The husband’s
                    evidence as to the plaintiff’s personality changes was
                    consistent over a period of time because he not only
                    testified but also reported to the various doctors how she
                    was doing at various times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Counsel for the plaintiff
                    submitted that her case was unique in that it involved a
                    brain injury which affected her vision and caused the onset
                    of a disease, namely, diabetes. The existing precedents were
                    only relevant to establish a base point before adding on.
                    Disregarding diabetes for the time being, I agree that the
                    plaintiff’s injuries were more serious than those in
                        <em>Harte</em> and <em>De Cruz</em>. Of all the cases that have
                    been cited, the one that came closest to the
                    plaintiff’s case is <em>Lee Wei
                        Kong</em>. The plaintiff there sustained severe
                    traumatic brain injury. He underwent emergency craniotomy
                    and removal of blood clots in the brain. He was found to
                    suffer from post traumatic amnesia and his cognitive
                    language and motor skills were impaired. He also had a
                    homonymous hemianopia. After discharge, the plaintiff
                    received all the treatment and help that he needed and
                    within five years, he made an exceptional recovery. He was
                    able to walk, swim, engage in recreational sports, travel by
                    public transport, make simple money transactions and
                    socialise. He also became a full time student despite some
                    remaining disabilities. As stated above, <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> was awarded $160,000 for his
                    injury. The AR taking the view that the plaintiff’s
                    injuries involved more pain and suffering because her
                    recovery was much more limited thought that she should get
                    more than <em>Lee Wei Kong</em> but
                    less than <em>Ramesh</em> because in
                    the latter case, the plaintiff was left unable to move or
                    talk and that is how the AR came up with
                $170,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I agree with the
                    parameters adopted by the AR and consider that she made a
                    fair assessment in the case of the plaintiff. Whilst she
                    could have nudged the award in favour of the plaintiff
                    closer to the <em>Ramesh</em> figure in
                    that although the plaintiff was able to move and talk, her
                    ability to resume a normal social and domestic life had been
                    substantially curtailed and she had an awareness of how her
                    life had changed, that does not mean that the amount awarded
                    to the plaintiff was inadequate. An appeal court does not
                    interfere with an award of damages unless the amount awarded
                    was clearly inadequate or clearly excessive. In this case, I
                    do not think that the amount of $170,000 for the
                    plaintiff’s head injuries, including the paralysis and
                    the loss of vision and loss of amenities, is either clearly
                    inadequate or clearly excessive. Therefore I will not
                    interfere with the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Diabetes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff claimed that
                    her diabetic condition had developed after the accident and
                    was brought on by the medication that she had to take to
                    deal with the side effects of her injuries. The defendants
                    disputed this on the basis that the plaintiff’s
                    diabetes was a pre-existing condition. The AR agreed that,
                    on the evidence, the diabetes had developed after the
                    accident and that there was no evidence to suspect that she
                    might have had undiagnosed diabetes before March 2008. The
                    AR, however, declined to make a separate award in relation
                    to the pain and suffering and loss of amenities resulting
                    from diabetes since it was a secondary injury and there was
                    no evidence as to the degree of pain and suffering and loss
                    of amenities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff appealed
                    against the decision not to make any award in respect of
                    diabetes. The defendants’ rejoinder was that this
                    decision was correct because in fact the plaintiff’s
                    diabetes was not a result of the accident and, in any event,
                    it was too remote and could not have been foreseen by them.
                    The defendants also agreed with the AR that there was no
                    pain and suffering or loss of amenities. Therefore, three
                    sub-issues arise in this connection:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     Causation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     Remoteness; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     Quantum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Causation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendants submitted
                    that the AR had erred in her evaluation of the medical
                    evidence for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                        plaintiff’s expert endocrinologist, Dr Lee Chung
                        Horn, had testified that the plaintiff could have had
                        the onset of diabetes in March 2007 when Dr Chua
                        found elevated blood sugars. The defendants pointed out
                        that Dr Lee had no idea of the plaintiff’s
                        weight in March 2007 though when he saw her in March
                        2011, it was 80kg. Whilst there was no evidence of
                        obesity as at March 2007, Dr Lee had agreed that
                        obesity was not in itself a conclusive contributing
                        factor and many thin patients had developed
                        diabetes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     In his report, Dr Lee stated that the
                        medication prescribed to the plaintiff in March 2007 to
                        control her behavioural problems was a contributory
                        cause to the emergence of diabetes in October 2007. He
                        testified that the drug Risperidone could bring up
                        undiagnosed diabetes and also cause diabetes, and the
                        drug Lexapro may have the side effect of causing
                        diabetes though this is not established. The defendants
                        argued that the AR had failed to note that the
                        antidepressants were only prescribed to the plaintiff
                        from 6 March 2007 and therefore could not have
                        contributed to the diabetes since Dr Lee considered
                        that its onset was possibly in March
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Lee had stated that diabetes is often an
                        asymptomatic condition and it is certainly possible for
                        persons to have diabetes without knowing of its
                        existence. The defendants argued that in that context,
                        there was every probability that diabetes may have set
                        in at any time after the accident and before March 2007
                        when the drugs were administered. The only way to
                        exclude that possibility would be to have sight of the
                        blood sugar reports of the plaintiff from Tan Tock Seng
                        Hospital and National University Hospital where she was
                        treated for her injuries after the accident. Whilst the
                        defendants had applied for these reports, the AR had not
                        allowed their production on the basis that there was no
                        issue of diabetes before the
                accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It should be noted that
                    the defendants did not call any expert on the issue of
                    diabetes and therefore their attack on the AR’s
                    finding had to be based on pointing what out they considered
                    to be flaws in Dr Lee’s evidence or areas in
                    which it supported their position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff responded
                    that the defendants’ case was based on conjecture and
                    speculation. The evidence before the court was that the
                    plaintiff did not have diabetes before the accident and she
                    was started on antidepressant drugs (which had the effect of
                    enhancing blood sugar levels) in March 2007. Then in October
                    2007, her diabetes was confirmed by Dr Chua.
                    Dr Lee’s evidence, which was not challenged by
                    another expert, was that whilst it was possible that the
                    plaintiff’s diabetes may have been present before the
                    accident, it was also entirely reasonable and more plausible
                    that it had arisen at some point after the accident and
                    injury. This was the more likely situation as without any
                    laboratory evidence to show the presence of high blood
                    glucose at a time before June 2006 it was not plausible to
                    surmise that the diabetes was present before June 2006. He
                    also suspected that between June 2006 and October 2007, her
                    glucose levels would have been measured during her periods
                    of hospitalisation as the blood glucose level is a component
                    of many laboratory tests. The fact that no glucose levels
                    were high until October 2007 was good <em>prima facie</em> evidence that glucose levels
                    only became abnormal around then. Dr Lee considered
                    that the factors that caused the plaintiff to develop
                    diabetes included immobility due to her injuries, the
                    medication prescribed for her behavioural problems and
                    obesity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the light of all the
                    evidence, I hold that the AR’s finding that the
                    diabetes developed after the injury and as a result of
                    factors associated with it, cannot be
                disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The plaintiff took issue
                    with comments by the AR that she had refused to follow
                    instructions in terms of exercise and diet after the
                    accident and this led to the development of diabetes. She
                    also suggested that the plaintiff should control her diet
                    and exercise more. The plaintiff pointed out that the
                    evidence before the court did not justify any inference that
                    she had by choice wilfully refused to control her diet and
                    to exercise despite comprehending full well the consequences
                    of diet and exercise on diabetes care. The plaintiff
                    suggested that the following evidence had been
                    overlooked:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     Dr Lee’s
                        testimony that she did not understand what it took
                        “to do a good job” in controlling her
                        diabetes and that it was difficult for her family to be
                        “100% strict with her at all
                        times”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Chua’s testimony that the
                        plaintiff had problems making lifestyle adjustments for
                        her diabetes due to her cognitive and psychiatric
                        problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     The fact that the plaintiff had
                        difficulty with visual perceptual function, spatial
                        judgment and concrete thinking and her planning ability
                        was impaired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I accept the
                    plaintiff’s submissions in this regard and do not hold
                    the plaintiff responsible for causing or exacerbating her
                    diabetic condition. The plaintiff was not capable of
                    understanding what she had to do to control her condition
                    and also had difficulty exercising in view of her physical
                    condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Remoteness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendants contended
                    that they could not be liable for the diabetic condition of
                    the plaintiff as it was too remote and could not have been
                    foreseen by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The test for remoteness of
                    damage is the test of reasonable foreseeability established
                    by the House of Lords in <em>Overseas
                        Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd
                        (The Wagon Mound)</em> [1961] AC 388.
                    The Court of Appeal reaffirmed the application of this test
                    in Singapore in <em>Ho Soo Fong and another v
                        Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 181 (“<em>Ho Soo
                        Fong</em>”) and <em>Sunny
                        Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming
                        Eric</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782. In
                        <em>Ho Soo Fong</em>, the court
                    observed at [39]
                    that <em>The Wagon Mound</em> principle
                    had been clarified subsequently by Lord Reid to indicate
                    that what was required was whether a reasonable man would
                    foresee a “real risk” of the damage occurring.
                    There would be a real risk if it was one that would occur to
                    the mind of a reasonable man in the position of the
                    defendant and which would not be brushed aside as being
                    far-fetched. At [42]
                    of the judgment, Chan Sek Keong CJ observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect, we do not agree that the reasonable
                        foreseeability test requires the tortfeasor to have
                        actual knowledge of the ultimate cause or kind of the
                        losses suffered by a claimant. No authority has been
                        cited to us, and the judge has referred to none, that
                        foreseeability as a factual element requires actual
                        knowledge of the specific cause or kind of the loss.
                        This approach is contrary to current jurisprudence on
                        remoteness of damage in tort law. In our view,
                        constructive knowledge of the kind of losses suffered is
                        sufficient to satisfy the foreseeability test of
                        remoteness of damage. This may be contrasted with the
                        corresponding test of remoteness in contract, where
                        actual knowledge is required but, even then, only for
                        extraordinary as opposed to ordinary loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In this respect, the
                    defendants relied on the Australian case of <em>Commonwealth of Australia v
                        W L McLean</em>
                    [1996] NSWSC 657 (“<em>McLean</em>”). There, the plaintiff, a
                    seaman, suffered nervous shock when the naval vessel on
                    which he was on board was involved in a collision in 1964.
                    As a consequence, the plaintiff developed post traumatic
                    stress disorder (“PTSD”). He claimed that the
                    PTSD caused him to drink alcohol and smoke tobacco to excess
                    and this had caused his throat cancer which was diagnosed in
                    1995. He sued his employer for damages and the response was
                    that the throat cancer was not foreseeable and was too
                    remote. In the view of the defendants here, this case stood
                    for the proposition that the egg-shell skull rule only
                    applies to damage of the same kind as that which is
                    foreseeable. The defendants then submitted that diabetes was
                    not in the same category as the initial head and leg
                    injuries sustained by the plaintiff and therefore did not
                    meet the remoteness rule as applied in the law of
                    tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I think that the
                    defendants misread <em>McLean</em>’s case. Although the court did
                    limit the application of the egg-shell skull rule, that was
                    not all that the case stood for. In fact, what it held was
                    that foreseeability was a question of fact for the jury and
                    that the plaintiff was only entitled to recover for the
                    further damage of the throat cancer if the jury found either
                    that it was damage of the same kind as the foreseeable
                    stress disorder or if they found that it was reasonably
                    foreseeable. Therefore, the issue went back to
                    foreseeability and the fact that the throat cancer was
                    damage of a different nature to the stress disorder did not
                    in itself mean that the plaintiff could not
                recover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In this case, the
                    plaintiff submitted that for her to succeed in her claim,
                    the foreseeability test did not require proof of actual
                    knowledge of the specific kind of loss (diabetes) on the
                    part of the defendants. As indicated in <em>Ho Soo Fong</em>, constructive knowledge of loss
                    would be sufficient to satisfy the test of remoteness. The
                    defendants knew that the accident had caused the plaintiff
                    serious injuries and a reasonable man in their shoes would
                    know that she would have to endure significant pain and
                    suffering as a result. The pain and suffering would include
                    all medical problems arising from the injuries and
                    treatment. A reasonable person would also know that drugs
                    administered to solve one medical problem can cause another
                    medical problem. It should be noted that Dr Chua had
                    testified that it was well-known that patients who had
                    severe disabilities which caused them to lose mobility were
                    likely to develop a whole host of conditions after the
                    injury like diabetes, cardiac disease, obesity and high
                    cholesterol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I accept the
                    plaintiff’s argument. I find that it was reasonably
                    foreseeable that the serious injuries sustained by the
                    plaintiff could cause her to develop other conditions like
                    diabetes. I therefore find that the damage is not too
                    remote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pain and suffering/quantum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The AR did not make a
                    separate award under this head for the diabetes because she
                    considered there was no evidence of pain and suffering and
                    loss of amenities associated with it. I agree with the
                    plaintiff that the AR overlooked the fact that the plaintiff
                    had entered into a diabetic coma and had to be hospitalised
                    in December 2010 due to her diabetes. Further, there would
                    be some loss of enjoyment of life due to the requirement to
                    restrict her diet and take medication. Having said that, I
                    accept that diabetes is not generally a painful condition
                    and may be asymptomatic for quite a while. However, I do
                    consider that an award should be made under this
                    head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff submitted
                    that an appropriate award would be in the region of $55,000.
                    She relied on the case of <em>Attorney
                        General v Ho Tee Ming</em>
                    [1968–1970] SLR(R) 382 where the plaintiff
                    was awarded $14,000 for the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.
                    This was a 42 year old case and looking at the Singapore
                    inflation rate of 2.73% per annum, the plaintiff submitted
                    that on the basis of today’s figures, $55,000 was
                    appropriate. In my judgment, that figure is too high.
                    Arthritis is a much more painful and disabling condition
                    than diabetes. I award the plaintiff $20,000 under this
                    head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Leg injury</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The award here was
                    $60,000. The plaintiff submitted this should be increased to
                    $80,000. She cited <em>Pang Teck Kong v Chew
                        Eng Hwa</em> [1992] SGHC 31
                        (“<em>Pang Kong
                    Teck</em>”) where the plaintiff was awarded
                    $50,000 for the amputation of his right leg, below the knee.
                    She also relied on <em>Mei Yue
                        </em><em>Lan Margaret v Raffles
                        City (Pte) Ltd</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 740
                    where the plaintiff suffered severe injury to her right leg
                    and was awarded $100,000 although the leg was not
                    amputated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The plaintiff submitted
                    that since <em>Pang Teck Kong</em> was
                    almost 20 years old the award had to be updated to keep up
                    with inflation. The other case could offer some guidance
                    although different on facts. Here, her leg injury was severe
                    and life threatening. It had an impact on her psychological
                    well being in that it made her feel useless and depressed.
                    It had a great impact on her physical well being as it made
                    her less mobile, transforming her from an active 50kg person
                    to an 80kg obese person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I do not agree that the
                    award is clearly inadequate. The plaintiff’s lack of
                    self esteem and increase in weight were due to many factors,
                    not just the loss of her leg. The plaintiff has a prosthesis
                    and would be able to get around fairly well if it were not
                    for her weakness in the left side (which has nothing to do
                    with the leg) and her impaired vision. I cannot attribute
                    all the side effects the plaintiff has suffered to the loss
                    of the leg. I will not interfere with this
                award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Special damages</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs of maid assistant/housekeeping services
                (pre-trial)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff claimed
                    $60,427.40 for loss of housekeeping services and the cost of
                    a maid prior to the trial. The AR made no award under this
                    head. She stated at page 9 of her judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I note that the evidence is that the Plaintiff used to
                        work part-time and also did the housework, hence hiring
                        a full-time maid for housekeeping is not warranted.
                        There is no evidence before me as to how much a
                        part-time maid would have cost in this situation, and
                        hence I am unable to give an award in relation to
                        additional costs of housekeeping incurred before the
                        assessment. I therefore make no award in this
                        respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The plaintiff appealed.
                    She argued that having accepted the evidence that she had
                    done the housekeeping before the accident and was unable to
                    continue doing so after the accident, the AR was wrong to
                    deny an award for housekeeping. This was especially so when
                    there was incontrovertible evidence that maids were actually
                    employed after the accident to do the housekeeping. Apart
                    from housekeeping, the evidence showed that the maid went
                    with the plaintiff when she had her physiotherapy sessions
                    and assisted the plaintiff’s husband in transferring
                    the plaintiff from her bed to bathe, clothe or move
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff cited
                        <em>Daly v General Steam
                        Navigation</em> [1981] 1 WLR 120 in
                    support. In that case, the English Court of Appeal awarded
                    the plaintiff housewife loss of housekeeping services after
                    she became incapable of undertaking household duties
                    following the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Having accepted the
                    evidence that the plaintiff was the housekeeper for her
                    family, the AR’s main objection to making an award
                    under this head was that there was no evidence as to how
                    much a part-time maid to undertake the plaintiff’s
                    duties would have cost. However, there was evidence before
                    her as to the actual amounts paid to the maid employed after
                    the accident. I think that she should have used these
                    figures to make her award. Expenses have been incurred which
                    would not have been incurred had the plaintiff remained able
                    to do the chores. The figure of $60,427.40 given by the
                    plaintiff included not only the salaries of the full-time
                    maids engaged but also the levy paid, food and other
                    expenses. The levy and other expenses would not have been
                    incurred had a part-time maid been employed. The figure for
                    salaries and agency fees alone comes to $33,724.40 over a
                    period of some four years or some $702 per month. I do not
                    think that a part-time maid who came in every week day would
                    have cost any less than this. I therefore award the
                    plaintiff the sum of $33,724.40 for the cost of employing a
                    maid to do the housekeeping.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loss of income of caregiver – husband
                (pre-trial)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     After the
                    plaintiff’s accident, her husband, Mr Chew Chwee
                    Kim, gave up his job in order to take care of her. The
                    plaintiff claimed his loss of income as part of the special
                    damages claim. The AR found that Mr Chew was directly
                    caring for the plaintiff at the material time and awarded a
                    sum of $86,000 as his loss of income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Two small points arise out
                    of this award. The first, made by the plaintiff, is that
                    since the pre-trial loss of income was $1,400 per month and
                    the period of the loss was 62 months from 15 June 2006
                    to 15 August 2011, the amount awarded should have been
                    $86,800 instead of $86,000. This appeared to be a
                    computational error and the plaintiff asked for it to be
                    corrected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The defendants accepted
                    the AR’s findings on the amount. They had only one
                    quarrel and that was with the period. The plaintiff was in a
                    nursing home for one month during the 62 months and the
                    defendants considered that that period should not have been
                    included for the loss of income claim. I do not agree. If
                    the plaintiff had been in the nursing home for a longer
                    period then of course the husband should have gone back to
                    work and should not have been compensated for loss of
                    income. The period of one month was too short for such a
                    calculation. One would expect that it would take him some
                    time to find a job or be sure that she would settle down in
                    the nursing home so that he was free to resume gainful
                    employment. I am not minded to allow the defendants’
                    appeal on this basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As for the
                    plaintiff’s appeal, I amend the award to $86,800 to
                    reflect the correct computation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nursing costs (pre-trial)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     This is again a situation
                    of computational error. The AR awarded $4,518.64. In the
                    appeal, the plaintiff pointed out that the total nursing
                    costs incurred before the trial were $4,518.64 for the
                    Nightingale Nursing Home and Econ Nursing Home and $704.05
                    for the cost of day care at St Luke Elder Care for one
                    week from 9 June 2011. The defendants did not appeal
                    against the award. I amend the award to $5,222.69 to reflect
                    the actual costs incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff claimed
                    $12,033.80 as legal costs in relation to the order for
                    appointment of a committee of the person. Before the AR, the
                    defendants did not object to the claim except as to quantum
                    and plaintiff’s counsel explained that was why the
                    bills had been taxed. The AR then awarded the costs as
                    taxed. At the appeal, the defendants pointed out that the
                    costs included a sum of $2,315.60 in respect of an
                    application for leave to sell the plaintiff’s HDB flat
                    and submitted that this amount should not be allowed as it
                    was related to the application for an appointment of
                    committee of the person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The plaintiff’s
                    response was that this application would not have been
                    necessary but for the accident and the plaintiff’s
                    resultant disability. Secondly, the application was related
                    to the appointment of the committee because a court would
                    not give blanket authorisation to the committee to deal with
                    a patient’s assets, including her immovable property,
                    from the beginning. The application could only be made when
                    circumstances justifying the sale arose and in this case,
                    that only happened nine months after the appointment of the
                    committee of the person. The application was filed because
                    the Housing and Development Board required an order that was
                    specifically tailored to its requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I accept the
                    plaintiff’s arguments and will not interfere with this
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Future expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiplier for future care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The AR fixed the
                    multiplier for the cost of future care at 17 years.
                    Both parties appealed against this decision. The plaintiff
                    contended it should be 20 years whilst the defendants
                    said that it should be 15 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The plaintiff relied on
                    the precedent of <em>Ang Leng Hock v Leo Ee
                        </em><em>An</em>
                    [2003] SGHC 240 (“<em>Ang
                        Leng Hock</em>”). There a 45 year old
                    man (with a life expectancy of 78 years) was awarded a
                    multiplier of 20 years for future medical expenses. The
                    plaintiff was 51 years old with a life expectancy of 83
                    years. Both she and the plaintiff in <em>Ang
                        Leng Hock</em> therefore had similar life
                    expectancies of 32 to 33 years and therefore, the
                    plaintiff argued, the multiplier should be
                similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The defendants submitted
                    that the multiplier should be 15 years and in any event
                    should not exceed the 17 years that the AR had awarded.
                    In <em>Ong Tean Hoe v Hong Kong Industrial
                        Company Pte Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 3030, a
                    52 year old plaintiff was awarded a multiplier of
                    15 years. The defendants also cited <em>Ang Leng Hock</em> in support of their arguments.
                    They pointed out that at the time of trial, the plaintiff
                    was 52 years old not 51 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the state of the
                    authorities, I see no reason to interfere with the
                    AR’s decision to fix the multiplier at
                    17 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Post-trial costs of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The AR, considering that
                    there was consensus between parties that the costs of a maid
                    and day care would be appropriate to provide for the daily
                    care of the plaintiff, awarded $9,288 yearly to cover the
                    costs of the maid and $9,600 yearly to cover the costs of
                    day care. On appeal, both parties were satisfied with the
                    amount awarded for the provision of a maid. However, in
                    relation to the cost of day care, the plaintiff wanted this
                    increased to $24,759.80 yearly on the basis of the quotation
                    from St Luke’s Eldercare whilst the defendants
                    argued that the plaintiff could be taken care of at home by
                    the maid alone and did not need day care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defendants argued that
                    the AR should have rejected the plaintiff’s claim for
                    day care because of the family’s unreasonable stand.
                    There was evidence from Dr Chua that she had not
                    received recent input from the family of any issues between
                    the plaintiff and the maid and, in any event, medication had
                    been prescribed to control her behaviour. The AR had also
                    failed to consider the evidence of the husband’s
                    employer that they had provided him with flexible working
                    arrangements and if there were no containers to clear, Mr
                    Chew could stay at home. Thus, the plaintiff’s husband
                    could have explored the option of being employed and placing
                    the plaintiff in a day care centre when he was at
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I do not accept the
                    defendants’ submissions. It is not satisfactory to
                    expect the husband to be able to arrange for day care at the
                    drop of a hat as and when his employers call him. It was
                    also Dr Chua’s evidence that the plaintiff needed
                    someone to assist her on an almost 24 hour basis and
                    that assistance could come from the husband, the maid and
                    day care facilities or a combination of the same.
                    Dr Chua also testified that the advantage of community
                    day care to the plaintiff would be that she would become
                    more mobile, more independent to a certain level and she
                    would be taken away from the four walls of her home and
                    would have less time to ruminate and be paranoid. It would
                    also help with her diet control and there would be medical
                    staff who could check her condition and report to the Tan
                    Tock Seng Rehabilitation Centre if anything was wrong.
                    Accordingly, I consider that the AR was right in principle
                    to make an award for both a maid and day care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Turning to the quantum of
                    day care, the plaintiff argued that the AR’s reliance
                    on Dr Chua’s estimated day care charges was
                    misplaced because Dr Chua did not include the costs of
                    physiotherapy and transport. To arrive at the costs of care,
                    they needed to add the physiotherapy costs, transport costs,
                    meals for caregiver and GST to the day care costs. The
                    plaintiff calculated the costs if she attended day care
                    services five times a week, did physiotherapy everyday, and
                    used the transport provided on the basis of
                    Dr Chua’s figures and on the basis of figures
                    given by St Luke’s Eldercare. These worked out as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The plaintiff submitted
                    that the St Luke’s Eldercare figures should be
                    accepted because this facility was near their home and it
                    was well maintained and had a large pool of patients. It had
                    a physiotherapist and staff who spoke Chinese and would be
                    able to communicate with the plaintiff. Most importantly, it
                    operated until 6.30pm which would mean that Mr Chew
                    would be able to reach home from work before the plaintiff
                    returns and this would avoid a situation of the maid being
                    left alone with the plaintiff. The alternative, Salem
                    Welfare Services, did not have a Chinese speaking
                    physiotherapist, was smaller and stuffy, had limited
                    activities and patients, and was only open till 5pm. The
                    figures in the Salem invoices (much lower than the St
                    Luke’s Eldercare figures) could not be the basis for
                    computing costs of day care for a full day since the
                    plaintiff only had been there for one or two hours during
                    her physiotherapy sessions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     On the basis of Dr
                    Chua’s evidence, I agree with the AR that there was no
                    need for the plaintiff to have full-time day care every day.
                    Instead, she could go to day care twice or thrice a week to
                    give the maid time to do her chores and also to have
                    physiotherapy and interact with others. There was no
                    evidence that the plaintiff needed to have physiotherapy
                    every day. However, I take the point that
                    Dr Chua’s figures did not include transport and
                    probably did not include physiotherapy which she did not
                    specifically mention. If the plaintiff went to day care
                    three times a week, then the cost, based on St Luke’s
                    Eldercare figures for three days a week, would not exceed
                    $13,104 a year. I have not factored in the caregiver’s
                    meals as the point of going to day care is partly to relieve
                    the caregiver. Adding the GST of 7%, the total would come to
                    $14,021.28 a year which I will round down to $14,000 per
                    year. I have used the St Luke’s Eldercare figures
                    on the basis that this is the most convenient day care
                    centre as far as the plaintiff is concerned. Further, there
                    is apparently a subsidy available to the plaintiff and if
                    this is used, the plaintiff may even be able to attend
                    St Luke’s Eldercare every weekday though she may
                    not be able to have physiotherapy every day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Accordingly, I increase
                    the award for day care from $9,600 a year to $14,000 per
                    year.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Future medical expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The AR awarded the
                    plaintiff $1,200 per year for expenses (excluding
                    medication) related to diabetes. The plaintiff submitted
                    that that award was inadequate because the AR’s reason
                    for the sum was that the plaintiff had to take some
                    responsibility for the eventual development of diabetes. The
                    defendants on the other hand submitted that nothing at all
                    should have been awarded as the diabetes was not caused by
                    the accident. I have dealt with the arguments of causation
                    and remoteness above. I have found that the diabetes was
                    caused by the accident and that the plaintiff could not be
                    blamed for its development. On that basis, the plaintiff
                    should be able to recover all reasonable expenses which will
                    be incurred because of the diabetes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The plaintiff adduced
                    evidence that she would need to spend $2,905.29 per year
                    which sum would be made up as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_a"></a>(a)     Syringe –
                        need two per day – 100 pieces per box at $38.73 -
                        $0.72 per day - $282.73 per year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_b"></a>(b)     Alcohol swab
                        – need six per day – 100 pieces per box at
                        $4.48 - $0.27 per day - $98.55 per
                    year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_c"></a>(c)     Needle (microlet lancet) – for blood test
                        – need four per day – 100 pieces at $20 -
                        $0.80 per day - $292 per year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_d"></a>(d)     Blood test strips
                        – need four per day – 50 pieces per box at
                        $62 - $4.96 per day - $1,810.69 per
                    year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_e"></a>(e)     Insulin – one bottle a month at $9 - $108
                        per year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_f"></a>(f)     Medical cream - $26.11 per tube per
                        month - $313.32 per year.</p>
<p>The AR noted that these expenses were supported by
                    receipts and that the plaintiff spent about $200 monthly on
                    diabetes related materials. She halved the amount that she
                    would otherwise have awarded because of her finding as to
                    the plaintiff’s contribution to her condition. As I
                    have reversed that finding, there is no basis on which to
                    reduce the amount which the plaintiff can claim. I therefore
                    increase the award to $2,905.29 per year for 17
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Provisional damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The plaintiff asked the AR
                    to make an order for provisional damages so that she could
                    obtain compensation if she developed arthritis, sustained a
                    functional decline, suffered from seizures, and developed
                    complications from diabetes. The AR considered the possible
                    complications that the plaintiff might suffer and concluded
                    that the conditions for the granting of a provisional
                    damages order had not been satisfied. She therefore declined
                    to make such an order. Before me, the plaintiff repeated her
                    arguments as to why the provisional damages order would be
                    appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Although the courts were
                    given the power as far back as 1993 to “award in any
                    action for damages for personal injuries, provisional
                    damages assessed on the assumption that a contingency would
                    not happen and further damages at a future date if the
                    contingency happens” (see paragraph 16 of the First
                    Schedule of the Supreme Court Judicature Act (Cap 322 2007
                    Rev Ed) (“Paragraph 16”)), they have exercised
                    this power only rarely. I was referred to just two reported
                    cases in which orders for provisional damages had been made
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The first of these cases
                    is <em>ACD (by her next friend B) v See Mun
                        Li</em> [2009] SGHC 217
                        (“<em>See Mun
                    Li</em>”). This was the decision of Teo Guan
                    Siew AR in connection with the assessment of the damages
                    payable to a young girl who sustained head injuries as a
                    result of a traffic accident. Due to the lack of local
                    authorities, the AR in <em>See Mun
                        Li</em> considered the English authorities on a
                    similar provision in England and concluded that in England
                    before such an order could be made, the following
                    considerations had to be looked at:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_a"></a>(a)     In England, the
                        “chance” under s 32A of their applicable
                        legislation must be measurable rather than
                        fanciful.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_b"></a>(b)     There must be a clear and severable
                        risk rather than a continuing deterioration, <em>ie</em>, there must be a clear-cut
                        event that would trigger the entitlement to apply for
                        further compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a>(c)     Account must be had to the
                        degree of risk and the consequences of the risk,
                            <em>ie</em>, how severe the
                        nature of the illness or deterioration is and its
                        detrimental effect on the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_d"></a>(d)     A balancing
                        exercise needs to be undertaken to determine whether
                        justice is better served by a once-and-for-all
                        assessment or by giving the claimant the liberty to
                        return to apply for further damages in the
                        future.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_e"></a>(e)     A claimant should not be prejudiced
                        if he decides not to utilise the option of applying for
                        a provisional order: the court would do its best in the
                        circumstances to consider the risks of future medical
                        complications in arriving at an award for immediate
                        damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR considered that the
                    above principles ought, broadly speaking, to be equally
                    relevant in deciding whether or not a provisional order for
                    damages should be made in Singapore. The only caveat was
                    that in applying these principles, the court should have
                    regard to the differences in the wording of the local
                    legislation from that applicable in the UK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In this connection, I
                    would emphasise that the Singapore legislation uses the word
                    “contingency” and refers to damages being
                    assessed on the assumption that such contingency
                    “will not happen”, in which case further
                    damages may be given if the contingency
                    “happens” at a future date. In the English
                    legislation, in contrast, in order to get an order for
                    provisional damages there must be proved or admitted to be a
                    chance that in the future the injured person will
                    “develop some serious disease or suffers some serious
                    deterioration” in his physical or mental condition.
                    Our language is considerably wider and does not impose such
                    conditions. Having said that, I agree that not every
                    contingency could justify an award for provisional damages.
                    The contingency must be one of a serious nature in order to
                    prevent legal resources being expended when only
                    insubstantial damages can be recovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Some two years later, the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Koh Chai Kwang v Teo
                        Ai Ling (by her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)</em>
                    [2011] 3 SLR 610 considered Paragraph 16 in the
                    context of making an award for provisional damages in
                    relation to loss of future earnings. The court noted at
                        [50] that
                    Paragraph 16 is drafted much more widely than the
                    English provisions and (at [51]) unlike the English case, it is not
                    limited to the situation where there is a chance that the
                    injured plaintiff will in the future develop some serious
                    disease or suffer some serious deterioration in his or her
                    physical condition. The court went further in [51] to say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Undoubtedly, if the contingency relates to a
                        physical or mental condition (that would be a fact which
                        could be objectively determined), the injured plaintiff
                        may ask for additional damages pursuant to the
                        provisional damages order should the contingency occur.
                        However, there is no reason why the contingency could
                        not relate to some other future fact or circumstance, so
                        long as the occurrence of that fact or circumstance is
                        something which can be objectively determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal did not comment on <em>See Mun Li</em> as that position was not
                    relevant to the facts before it, but it appears to me that
                    the court would have taken a rather more liberal approach to
                    a provisional damages award for a physical condition than
                    the English judges are able to do. As long as the
                    contingency can be objectively identified and, subsequently,
                    objectively determined to have occurred, then when it does
                    occur, a provisional damages award may be made. It should be
                    noted that later in its judgment (at [52] –
                    [53]), the court
                    noted that in order to prevent future dispute, one must be
                    able to define the precise contingency upon which further
                    damages should be awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The plaintiff submitted
                    that the contingencies that might allow her to make a claim
                    for further damages were complications arising from
                    diabetes, the development of arthritis and the risk of
                    functional decline. I will deal with the latter two
                    conditions first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     While Dr Chua had noted
                    that due to the accident, the plaintiff would be at risk of
                    arthritic changes, there was no evidence from an orthopaedic
                    surgeon as to the degree of such risk or when such changes
                    were likely to occur. I think this evidence was not strong
                    enough to support a finding that there was a reasonable
                    likelihood of arthritis occurring within the not too distant
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As for functional decline,
                    Dr Chua’s evidence was that the plaintiff was at risk
                    of this happening. The AR accepted that such a decline was
                    not a fanciful prospect but declined to make an award for it
                    on the basis that it was not a clear-cut event. I agree. If
                    you cannot specify at what point the contingency has
                    occurred, then the contingency cannot be objectively
                    determined as the law requires.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The third contingency
                    related to possible complications from diabetes. The
                    plaintiff submitted that the medical evidence established
                    the risk of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     Eye
                        complications meaning cataracts, glaucoma, retinopathy,
                        vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment,
                        blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     Renal complications meaning kidney
                        failure.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_c"></a>(c)     Infections meaning conjunctivitis,
                        endophthalmitis, peripheral neuropathy which may
                        predispose her to gangrene and limb
                    amputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_d"></a>(d)     Coronary heart
                disease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The conditions described
                    above were derived from the report of Dr Lee Chung
                    Horn, the endocrinologist, who stated that these were
                    complications that could arise from diabetes. In his report
                    he said that the more poorly controlled the diabetes is, the
                    higher the risk of developing complications from the
                    condition. He also said that the time frame for such
                    complications to arise would vary from individual to
                    individual. Persons who do a poor job of controlling their
                    diabetes or who are unable to strenuously apply themselves
                    to the task of control may develop complications in a matter
                    of three to five years. Dr Lee evaluated the plaintiff
                    in March 2011 and found that her diabetes was under control.
                    She did not have kidney complications or heart disease.
                    However, the progression to diabetic ketoacidosis in
                    December 2010 was reflective of the rate of deterioration
                    and difficulty in controlling it in this case. He therefore
                    opined that it would reasonable to conclude that the
                    plaintiff would develop complications in a matter of three
                    to five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The medical evidence that
                    the plaintiff was at risk of developing complications from
                    diabetes in three to five years was not challenged by any
                    expert evidence adduced by the defendants. It would
                    therefore seem that such a development is a contingency
                    which justifies the making of an order for provisional
                    damages. It is not a fanciful but a clear risk and one that
                    has not been provided for in the assessment of damages for
                    pain and suffering as the plaintiff has not suffered any of
                    these complications so far. The question is which
                    complication should be the subject of an order and what the
                    time frame for the same should be. The plaintiff suggested
                    that the development of any complication from diabetes would
                    be sufficient. I think that is vague and it would be hard
                    for someone assessing damages at a later stage to decide
                    whether the contingency had arisen. I would therefore
                    specify the complications as being renal failure, glaucoma,
                    blindness, gangrene and coronary heart disease as being the
                    serious complications that would allow the plaintiff to
                    apply for an award of damages in the future. As for the
                    period, since both Dr Lee and Dr Chua gave an estimation of
                    three to five years, I would choose the longer period and
                    allow the plaintiff to make an application if any of these
                    complications arise within five years from the date of this
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Accordingly, I allow the
                    appeal on this point and make an order that the plaintiff
                    may apply for further damages to be assessed if within five
                    years of today, she develops, as a result of her diabetes,
                    any of the following medical conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     Renal
                        failure;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     Gangrene;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_c"></a>(c)     Blindness and/or
                        glaucoma;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_d"></a>(d)     Coronary heart
                disease.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the result, the
                    plaintiff’s appeal is allowed in part and the
                    defendants’ appeal is dismissed. I will hear the
                    parties on costs.</p>
