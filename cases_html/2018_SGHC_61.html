First, there is the question of the manner in which the obligation under s 10(2) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOPA”) to serve a payment claim (also known as a progress claim) in accordance with the time specified in a contract may be met by parties seeking to rely on the adjudication mechanism under the SOPA to resolve their payment disputes. Second, there is also the question of whether any objection to a defect in the fulfilment of this obligation has been waived by the respondent to the claim or, put another way, whether the respondent is estopped from raising any objection to the validity of the service of the payment claim, having not raised such objection earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having heard the submissions of the parties, I reserved judgment. I now set out my decision and the accompanying reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 This dispute arose out of a contract for the construction of a condominium development at Faber Walk. Authentic was the main contractor engaged by the developer of the project, World Class Land Pte Ltd, while Benlen was engaged by Authentic as a subcontractor for the project. Specifically, Authentic had engaged Benlen, pursuant to a letter of award dated 2 June 2015, to supply, install and maintain the mechanical ventilation and air-conditioning system for the project (“the Subcontract”).

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Based on the parties’ submissions, and as I have alluded to earlier (at [2] above), the main issues that arise for my determination in this application may be summarised as:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether PC 19 was validly served (“the Validity of Service Issue”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) even if PC 19 was not validly served, whether Authentic had waived its right to object to the invalid service of PC 19 or was estopped from raising such an objection (“the Waiver and Estoppel Issue”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my judgment, PC 19 was invalidly served. However, Authentic had waived its right to object to Benlen’s invalid service, and is now estopped from raising such an objection. Accordingly, I dismiss the Setting Aside Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Validity of Service Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my view, Benlen’s service of PC 19 was invalid. Benlen had acted in breach of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract by serving PC 19 on 23 June 2017. Also, PC 19 had not been varied by the 23 September Email, such that Benlen was still obliged to serve PC 19 on Authentic only on the 25th of every month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The starting position in respect of this issue must, of course, be the language of the applicable provision in the governing statute, which is s 10(2) of the SOPA. Section 10(2) provides for the obligation of timely service of payment claims in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">10.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) A payment claim shall be served —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) at such time as specified in or determined in accordance with the terms of the contract; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where the contract does not contain such provision, at such time as may be prescribed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is the applicable subsection in this case because the time for the service of payment claims is specified in the terms of the Subcontract. Specifically, cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract provides that Benlen “shall submit progress claims to [Authentic]” on the “25th day of [every] Calendar month”. It is thus necessary, based on the language of s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with cl 8.1 and Appendix 1 of the Subcontract, for Benlen to serve its payment claims on the 25th day of every month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The effect of a breach of s 10(2) of the SOPA is that even though the appointment of the adjudicator may be valid (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the adjudicator has jurisdiction at the threshold), the entire proceedings would be rendered invalid such that the adjudicator’s determination would nonetheless be liable to be set aside (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the adjudicator lacks substantive jurisdiction). This is because, as explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1011 (“<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span>”), s 10(2) is a mandatory provision, the breach of which renders the adjudication determination invalid. See <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49]–[50] and [53], cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) at [21] and [42].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 But all of this only takes us to the point where the parties begin to diverge from the common ground they share on this issue. Authentic insists that Benlen’s service of PC 19 on 23 June 2017 was invalid as it was premature and thus in breach of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract, and accordingly, s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA. In contrast, Benlen takes the position that its service of PC 19 was valid because Authentic had, by the 23 September Email, varied the terms of the Subcontract to allow Benlen to serve its payment claims any time between the 23rd and the 25th of every month (see [22]–[23] above). There are thus two discrete questions here: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, was Benlen’s service of PC 19 in breach of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, had cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract been varied by the 23 September Email? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I will now proceed to consider both sub-issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Benlen’s service of PC 19 was in breach of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, the service of PC 19 on 23 June 2017 was in breach of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Authentic submits that s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA requires Benlen to have served PC 19 on exactly 25 June 2017, and not 23 June 2017. To this end, Authentic relies on the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 165 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (HC)</span>”) to argue that Benlen had the obligation to serve PC 19 on 25 June 2017, neither sooner nor later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (HC)</span>, the respondent contractor engaged the applicant subcontractor pursuant to a subcontract. By cl 59 read with Appendix 1 of that subcontract, the applicant was required to serve its payment claims on the 20th day of each calendar month. However, the applicant served one of its payment claims on the respondent on 18 November 2016, but dated the payment claim 20 November 2016. The applicant’s reason for having done so was that 20 November 2016 fell on a Sunday, and that it would not have been feasible to serve a payment claim on that day. The respondent did not serve any payment response in relation to this payment claim. Before the adjudicator, the respondent challenged the validity of the payment claim on the basis that it had not been served on the 20th day of the month as required under the subcontract. The adjudicator disagreed with the respondent, and ruled in favour of the applicant. The respondent applied to the High Court to set aside the adjudication determination. Lee Seiu Kin J set aside the adjudication determination on the ground that as the payment claim had not been served on time, it was in contravention of the mandatory provision under s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA and was thus not a valid payment claim (at [50]). Lee J rejected the applicant’s reasons for serving the payment claim on 18 November 2016, and held that service of the payment claim should have taken place on 20 November 2016 because “the terms of the [c]ontract provide that service of the [payment claim] must be done on the 20th day of the month, <span class="font-italic">neither sooner nor later</span>” [emphasis added] (at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 But that is not all as far as the relevant case law is concerned. In the period since I reserved my judgment in this matter on 23 October 2017, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (HC) </span>has since been brought on appeal before the Court of Appeal. On 13 November 2017, the Court of Appeal heard and allowed the appeal. The apex court has since issued its grounds of decision on 22 January 2018. In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal accepted that the <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> was that the payment claim in that case ought to have been served on 20 November 2016, because where the parties’ contract provides for the service of payment claims <span class="font-italic">on </span>a stipulated date, this meant service of the payment claim <span class="font-italic">on </span>that date; it could not mean service <span class="font-italic">by </span>that date (at [23]). But the court crucially went on to hold that the payment claim, having been physically served on 18 November 2016, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, two days before the specified day in the contract, was nevertheless validly served for the following two reasons (at [26]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… First, <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff had a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">good reason</span><span class="font-italic"> for effecting service of the payment claim before 20 November 2016</span>. That day was a Sunday, and there was no dispute that the respondent’s office was closed on Sundays. Second, <span class="font-italic">there </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could not have been any confusion</span><span class="font-italic"> as to the payment claim’s operative date</span>. The payment claim was correctly dated 20 November 2016, the day on which the contract entitled the appellant to serve a payment claim. In our judgment, it was clear and obvious to the respondent from this manner of dating that the appellant intended for the payment claim to be treated as being served and, importantly, operative only on 20 November 2016. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the court’s view, if there is no good reason for serving a payment claim early, early service of a payment claim would not be considered to be valid service (at [29]). Also, if serving a payment claim early might cause confusion as to its operative date, such service would likewise not be considered valid (at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my judgment, the key principles that may be distilled from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA) </span>in this regard are that a payment claim that was not served on a date stipulated in the parties’ contract could be considered to have been validly served, even though it was served early, if: (a) the claimant had good reason for serving the payment claim early; and (b) the early service of the payment claim did not cause any confusion as to the payment claim’s operative date. Having said all that, I do not think that the Court of Appeal’s reversal of the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (HC) </span>has any impact on my ultimate finding on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Here, Benlen claims to have served PC 19 on 23 June 2017 because 25 June 2017 was a Sunday and was also a designated public holiday on account of Hari Raya Puasa. Benlen thus claims that it would not have been feasible for it to serve PC 19 on 25 June 2017, given that Authentic’s office premises would not have been open on weekends, much less public holidays.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Ho’s 1st Affidavit, p 8, paras 44–45.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Since the Court of Appeal considered the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA) </span>to have had good reason for effecting service of the payment claim on 18 November 2016 (instead of 20 November 2016), on the ground that it was not feasible to serve the payment claim on 20 November 2016, which was a Sunday, it should <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>stand to reason that Benlen can be considered to similarly have had good reason for serving PC 19 on 23 June 2017 in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the need for the early service of the payment claim to not cause any confusion as to the payment claim’s operative date, I take the view that it is at this juncture where Benlen’s submission falls just short. The applicant in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span> had correctly dated its payment claim as 20 November 2016 even though it had physically served the payment claim on 18 November 2016. This, according to the Court of Appeal, made it clear and obvious to the respondent there that the applicant had intended for the payment claim to be treated as being served and operative only on 20 November 2016. The same could not be said for PC 19 in the present case. Benlen served PC 19, which was dated 23 June 2017, on 23 June 2017, even though PC 19 was contractually required to be served on the 25th of every month. In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal had expressly stated thus (at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Similarly, if serving a payment claim early might cause confusion as to its operative date, we would also not consider such service to be valid. <span class="font-italic">For instance, if the payment claim in this case was not only physically served on but also dated </span><span class="font-italic">18 November 2016, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that would likely be invalid service</span><span class="font-italic"> because, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">short of a contrary indication from the appellant</span><span class="font-italic">, the respondent would reasonably be confused about the operative date of the payment claim. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There was no evidence of any contrary indication from Benlen in this case that it had intended PC 19 to be operative from 25 June 2017 (and not 23 June 2017). Authentic would thus, borrowing the words of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>, “reasonably be confused about the operative date of [PC 19]”. It therefore seems clear to me that PC 19 had been invalidly served in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 At this juncture, I should however pause to highlight the availability of a commercially practicable and eminently sensible solution for all future claimants seeking to resolve their disputes arising out of construction contracts by way of adjudication under the SOPA who might be confronted by a situation similar to that faced by Benlen in this case. In this respect, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA) </span>held that pursuant to s 50(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Interpretation Act”), if an obligation under the SOPA is to be performed on an “excluded day” (which is defined in s 50(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Interpretation Act as a Sunday or a public holiday), that obligation may be performed the next day (at [35]). The relevant provisions read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Computation of time</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">50.</span> In computing time for the purposes of any written law, unless the contrary intention appears —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if the last day of the period is a Sunday or a public holiday (which days are referred to in this section as excluded days) the period shall include the next following day not being an excluded day;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) when any act or proceeding is directed or allowed to be done or taken on a certain day, then, if that day happens to be an excluded day, the act or proceeding shall be considered as done or taken in due time if it is done or taken on the next day afterwards, not being an excluded day;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, it would thus have been open for Benlen to have served PC 19 on Authentic on 27 June 2017. As mentioned earlier, 25 June 2017 was not only a Sunday, but <span class="font-italic">also</span> a public holiday on account of Hari Raya Puasa (see [37] above). With Hari Raya Puasa falling on a Sunday, the next day, 26 June 2017, was also a public holiday. This means that the very first day following the Hari Raya Puasa on 25 June 2017 that would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be considered an excluded day would be the Tuesday falling on 27 June 2017. Benlen would accordingly have been entitled pursuant to s 50(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 50(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Interpretation Act to fulfil its statutory obligation of timely service of payment claims under s 10(2) of the SOPA by serving PC 19 <span class="font-italic">two days after </span>25 June 2017, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 27 June 2017. In addition, service of the payment claim on 27 June 2017 in such a context would have been valid irrespective of whether the payment claim was dated 25 June 2017 or 27 June 2017.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Unfortunately, Benlen appeared to not be cognizant of, and was hence unable to adopt, the solution in s 50(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Interpretation Act that was proposed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span> when serving PC 19 on Authentic. I thus find that PC 19 had been served in breach of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I now turn to consider Benlen’s alternative submission, which is that Authentic had, by the 23 September Email, varied the terms of the Subcontract to allow Benlen to serve its payment claims any time between the 23rd and the 25th of every month.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract had been varied by the 23 September Email</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I do not think that cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract had been varied by the 23 September Email. Specifically, I find that there has been no variation of the Subcontract, be it by way of the variation mechanism specifically provided for under cl 14.2 of the Subcontract, or by way of the formation of a collateral contract to vary the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Variation in writing pursuant to cl 14.2 of the Subcontract</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I begin my analysis by first having regard to cl 14.2 of the Subcontract, which states that the Subcontract “shall be varied or modified only with <span class="font-italic">prior written consent </span>from <span class="font-italic">both </span>parties” [emphasis added]. The effect of this clause is that the Subcontract is in fact an agreement permitting variation. In this regard, I find the following extract from Sean Wilken QC and Karim Ghaly’s seminal treatise, <span class="font-italic">Wilken and </span><span class="font-italic">Ghaly: The Law of Waiver, Variation, and Estoppel</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Wilken and </span><span class="font-italic">Ghaly</span>”) (at paras 2.42–2.43), to be instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A rigid formal adherence to the requirements of variation creates difficulties in practice. Such difficulties have been mitigated by two <span class="font-italic">mechanisms for variation of a contract </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">without</span><span class="font-italic"> the express consent of the parties to, or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">consideration for, that variation</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> The first mechanism is clearly established and involves construing certain agreements as if the parties had agreed to permit certain types of variation to those agreements. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The common law allows agreements permitting variation in two cases. First, <span class="font-italic">when the parties incorporate within the contract a set of rules themselves providing for their own variation or amendment.</span> … Second, <span class="font-italic">where the parties have either expressly or impliedly agreed that one or both of them should have the power to vary the agreement … that party will have that power</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Applying these principles to the present arrangement under the Subcontract, cl 14.2 of the Subcontract makes it possible to vary the Subcontract even if no additional consideration is provided, where both parties provide prior written consent to the proposed variation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the light of that observation, it is immediately evident that Authentic’s contention that the Subcontract could not have been varied by way of the 23 September Email because there was no consideration provided for the variation through the mechanism under cl 14.2 of the Subcontract, must be rejected.

</div> It is immaterial in this regard if the purported variation conferred a benefit on Benlen by allowing Benlen to submit payment claims on three possible dates each month (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 23rd, 24th or 25th) instead of just a single date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 25th), but no benefit appeared to have been gained by Authentic and no detriment appeared to have been suffered by Benlen in return.

In this regard, I agree with Authentic that there had only been written consent on the part of itself in favour of any variation, in the form of the 23 September Email, but there is no evidence whatsoever of any written consent on the part of Benlen to the purported variation by way of the 23 September Email.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Variation by collateral oral agreement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Next, I direct my mind to the possibility of variation of the Subcontract by way of the formation of a collateral contract to vary the Subcontract. In the first place, this is a necessary enquiry because cl 14.2 is insufficient to exclude the possibility of there being any variation of the Subcontract just because there is no evidence of any written consent from Benlen to the purported variation by way of the 23 September Email. Indeed, it is still possible for there to have been a variation of the Subcontract if there had been a separate <span class="font-italic">oral</span> agreement to vary the Subcontract. In support of this view, it has been recognised by the English courts that a term of the contract which states that the contract can only be varied in writing will <span class="font-italic">not</span> preclude the possibility of there being an <span class="font-italic">oral</span> variation: see <span class="font-italic">Globe Motors </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and others v TRW LucasVarity Electric Steering Ltd and another </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 396 at [95]–[113] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Beatson LJ, affirmed in <span class="font-italic">MWB Business Exchange</span><span class="font-italic"> Centres Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 553 at [34] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Kitchin LJ. As the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Wilken and </span><span class="font-italic">Ghaly</span> put it, the effect of a term requiring variation to be in writing is, at best, not to prohibit consensual oral variation but to raise a rebuttable presumption that, in the absence of writing, there had been no variation, and that this presumption will be rebutted only by strong evidence that both parties intended to orally vary the terms of the contract (at footnote 131 to p 26, citing <span class="font-italic">Spring Finance </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v HS Real Company LLC </span>[2011] EWHC 57 (Comm) at [53] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Judge Mackie QC). The upshot of this observation is that it is not enough for Authentic to simply rely on cl 14.2 of the Subcontract and assert that there can be no variation of the Subcontract just because there is no written evidence of any consent from Benlen to the arrangement reflected in the 23 September Email. It is necessary for me to look at the overall facts and circumstances surrounding the parties’ correspondence to also consider whether there was any collateral oral agreement to vary the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Authentic advances, to my mind, two arguments in favour of its position that the Subcontract had not been varied by way of a collateral oral agreement. First, Authentic submits that there was no variation by way of a collateral oral agreement because there was no consideration provided.

Insofar as Authentic insists that it has to be shown that it enjoys a <span class="font-italic">legal </span>benefit as a result of the arrangement, that is not the law. It suffices that Authentic can be shown to enjoy a mere <span class="font-italic">factual or practical</span> benefit as a result of the purported variation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Having said all that, I find Authentic’s second contention regarding the lack of any intention on the part of the parties to agree to a variation of cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract to be a valid objection to Benlen’s assertion that the Subcontract had been varied. In <span class="font-italic">Wilken</span> <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">Ghaly</span>, the learned authors state (at para 2.14) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… unless there is a specific provision which permits it, <span class="font-italic">a party cannot unilaterally vary the terms of a contract; there has to be acceptance of the variation of the contract, that acceptance being more than ‘mental acceptance or mere acquiescence’</span>.

Whereas Benlen suggests that the 23 September Email constitutes a variation of the Subcontract, it is not clear from the 23 September Email itself that it is meant to encapsulate an agreement to vary the Subcontract, instead of a mere unilateral notification by one party to the other (see [7] above). Neither is there anything prior to the 23 September Email to suggest that the 23 September Email was intended to be an offer made by Authentic to vary the obligation of Benlen under the Subcontract to serve payment claims only on the 25th day of every month, which Benlen could accept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Benlen submits that: (a) Ms Foong’s usage of the word “reminder” suggests that the 23 September Email was not the first time that Authentic had informed its subcontractors of the variation of the service dates for the payment claims; and (b) Benlen’s representative, Mr Ho Teck Beng (“Mr Ho”), had also received a call from one of Authentic’s staff prior to receiving the 23 September Email, confirming the variation.

</div>
</div>
</div> Presently, those suggestions remain bare assertions. Benlen’s submission in this regard is thus untenable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Even if the 23 September Email was indeed intended to be an offer to vary the Subcontract, there is nothing subsequent to the 23 September Email that shows that this offer had been accepted by Benlen. It is trite that acceptance in a contractual setting can be signified orally, in writing or by conduct, and that when there is a history of negotiations and discussions, the court will look at the whole continuum of facts in concluding whether a contract exists: <span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [48] <span class="font-italic">per </span>V K Rajah JC (as he then was). Here, there was no evidence that showed that the offer from Authentic (assuming it was one) had been accepted by Benlen, be it orally or by way of conduct. A perusal of the dates in which the rest of Benlen’s payment claims were served on Authentic following the 23 September Email does not show that there was any agreement to vary the date of service of the payment claim. There was no obvious trend of Benlen strictly serving its payment claims between the 23rd and 25th of every month (see [8] above). Granted, those dates of service also do not suggest that Benlen was adhering to the more stringent date of service specified under cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract. But that is immaterial, for the most that could be said of the subsequent conduct of Benlen is that it is of neutral probative value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Accordingly, I am of the view that there was simply no intention on the part of the parties for the 23 September Email to vary the obligation enshrined under cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract for Benlen to serve its payment claims on the 25th day of every month. This thus means that PC 19, which was served on 23 June 2017, had been invalidly served. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Validity of Service Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For all of the reasons canvassed earlier, I find that Benlen, by serving PC 19 on 23 June 2017, had not validly served PC 19 because it was contrary to the contractually stipulated date of service provided for under cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract. Also, Authentic had not, by way of the 23 September Email, varied cl 8.1 read with Appendix 1 of the Subcontract to allow Benlen to serve its payments claims between the 23rd and 25th day of every month. PC 19 was thus served in breach of s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, and had been invalidly served. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This, in turn, makes it necessary for me to proceed to consider the Waiver and Estoppel Issue in order to determine if the Adjudication Determination should ultimately be set aside on the ground of Benlen’s invalid service of PC 19.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Waiver and Estoppel Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In my view, although PC 19 had indeed been invalidly served, Authentic had waived its right to object to Benlen’s invalid service of PC 19, and is now estopped from raising any such objections.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Authentic contends in this regard that it should not be estopped from raising objections to Benlen’s invalid service of PC 19 at this stage of the proceedings for the following two reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a party may not waive his right to object to a breach of a provision of the SOPA that goes towards the substantive jurisdiction of the adjudicator.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 To my mind, both of Authentic’s contentions are unsustainable, especially in the light, once again, of the most recent Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I begin with Authentic’s first argument that objections to breaches of provisions of the SOPA that go towards the substantive jurisdiction of the adjudicator may not be waived. Whereas the law was previously relatively unclear in relation to whether a party may in fact waive his right to object to a breach of a provision of the SOPA that goes towards the substantive jurisdiction of the adjudicator, this cloud of uncertainty has most definitely been lifted with the incisive observations encapsulated within the <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span> decision. There, the Court of Appeal answered this question unreservedly in the affirmative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 To this end, the court in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA) </span>first clarified (at [45]) that an adjudicator has the power to decide matters that go towards his jurisdiction, thereby affirming the preliminary views expressed in the affirmative in this regard by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [67]). In arriving at this conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal respectfully departed from its previous decision in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li </span><span class="font-italic">Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 401 (where the Court of Appeal held that an adjudicator <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> deal with jurisdictional challenges). The court considered s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA to be a clear indication that an adjudicator has the power to consider whether a payment claim is valid and whether it has been validly served, and also found that this reading of s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) comports with the legislative purpose of the SOPA, which is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry through, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the speedy and efficient resolution of payment disputes. See <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction </span><span class="font-italic">(CA) </span>at [46]–[50]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Crucially, the <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span> court went on to expressly hold that the High Court decisions which reasoning had been premised on an adjudicator’s inability to rule on challenges to his jurisdiction should no longer be followed. These meant that the decisions in <span class="font-italic">JFC Builders Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">LionCity Construction Co Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1157, <span class="font-italic">Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v A Pacific Construction &amp; Development Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 776, <span class="font-italic">Admin Construction Pte Ltd v Vivaldi (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 609, <span class="font-italic">YTL Construction (S) Pte Ltd v Balanced Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2014] SGHC 142 and<span class="font-italic"> LH Aluminium Industries Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Newcon Builders Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 648 were no longer good law (see <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA) </span>at [51]). Accordingly, insofar as Authentic relies on these authorities to buttress its submission that no estoppel could arise from its failure to object to the validity of Benlen’s service of PC 19, its submission must surely fail. The same could also be said of Authentic’s reliance on the decision of <span class="font-italic">Rong</span><span class="font-italic"> Shun Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v CP Ong Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 4 SLR 359 in its submissions, insofar as this decision follows the positions taken in the aforementioned High Court decisions that have since been rejected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As for Authentic’s second argument that there was no waiver on the facts, it is useful once again to have regard to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>. In that case, the Court of Appeal set out the general principles of waiver by election and equitable estoppel (at [54]–[61]), and applied these principles to the context of adjudication under the SOPA (at [62]–[64]). The court then went on to hold that a respondent’s failure to object to a breach of a mandatory provision (the breach of which goes to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator) may be regarded as an unequivocal representation for the purpose of waiver by election and equitable estoppel, because s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA requires a respondent to include a jurisdictional objection in his payment response if he wants to raise a jurisdictional objection (at [65]–[66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It would be helpful at this juncture to take a closer look at s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, from which the Court of Appeal had inferred the duty to raise a jurisdictional objection at an early stage of the adjudication process in order to rely on it subsequently. Section 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Adjudication Responses</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The respondent shall not include in the adjudication response, and <span class="font-italic">the adjudicator shall not consider, any reason for </span><span class="font-italic">withholding any amount</span>, including but not limited to any cross-claim, counterclaim and set-off, <span class="font-italic">unless</span> —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) where the adjudication relates to a construction contract, the reason was included in the relevant payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The effect of this provision is, as observed by Tan Siong Thye J in <span class="font-italic">AES Façade Pte Ltd v WYSE Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 5 SLR 640 at [26], that “any reasons for withholding payment should be stated in the payment response; they cannot be held back and raised for the first time in adjudication”. Otherwise, the adjudicator would lack the power or jurisdiction to consider such reasons. In this regard, I find the following explanation by Tan J (at [51]) to be instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the object and purpose of the [SOPA] is to protect cash flow in the construction industry and to create a quick and efficient means of providing temporary finality to any disputes that may arise. The intended result is for employers to ‘pay first, argue later’, so that subcontractors would not be held up waiting till the end of a long-drawn dispute … for payment … One of the mechanisms by which this is intended to be achieved is enshrined in s 15(3), which clearly states that <span class="font-italic">any reasons for withholding payment … must be included in the payment response or be wholly disregarded by the adjudicator</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Such a strict requirement is necessary because of the tight timelines imposed under the [SOPA]; without s 15(3), a claimant might not have sufficient time to prepare himself for the case he was to meet at the adjudication. This in turn would lead to either difficulties for the claimant’s case, or a delay of the adjudication in order to allow the claimant to respond. <span class="font-italic">By including s 15(3), Parliament nipped such problems in the bud by requiring strict compliance before a set-off (or any other reason for withholding payment) could be raised at all.</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 When then would it be necessary for the respondent to register his or her objection to the breach of a mandatory provision? In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal made it clear that a failure to object would amount to an unequivocal representation of a decision to forgo one’s right to raise that objection <span class="font-italic">at the time by which the respondent is to file his payment response</span> (at [67], citing <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [68]). Accordingly, to summarise the foregoing discussion, the principles of waiver by election and equitable estoppel impose on the respondent a duty to speak, so to speak, by raising any objection that it might have regarding any matter that might affect the threshold or substantive jurisdiction of the adjudicator by the deadline for the respondent to submit its payment response.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Applying these principles to the facts of the present application, it is evident that Authentic’s submission that there was no waiver on the facts is of absolutely no merit. Pursuant to s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, Authentic was obliged to point out the defect in the date of service of PC 19 when it was submitting its payment response to PC 19, but it failed to do so (see [10] above). On this basis alone, it could be said that Authentic’s failure to raise its objection at that instance amounted to an unequivocal representation of its decision to forgo its right to raise that objection subsequently. But that was not the full extent of Authentic’s failure to object to Benlen’s purported breach of a mandatory provision. Authentic also failed to file its objection to the invalidity of Benlen’s service of PC 19 when filing its adjudication response (see [14] above). This was surely another point of time in the proceedings when Benlen would have reasonably expected Authentic to air its objections to the validity of the service of PC 19, if any, especially given that Benlen had also expressly referred, in its written submissions accompanying its Adjudication Application, to the fact that it had served PC 19 on 23 June 2017, and not on 25 June 2017 (see [12] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Accordingly, I find that Authentic had waived its right to object to the validity of Benlen’s service of PC 19, and it was estopped from raising such an objection in the proceedings before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons aforesaid, although I find that PC 19 had <span class="font-italic">not </span>been validly served, I find that Authentic had waived its right to object to any invalidity of service of PC 19, and is estopped from raising any such objection at this stage of the proceedings. In the result, I dismiss the Setting Aside Application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I shall hear the parties on costs within two weeks if the parties are not able to agree on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lazarus Nicholas Philip and Toh Yee Lin Jocelyn (Justicius Law Corporation) for the applicant;<br/>Ong Kok Seng Patrick and Chong Yi Mei (Patrick Ong Law LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
