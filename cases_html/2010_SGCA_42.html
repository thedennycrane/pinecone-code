        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Lam Chi Kin David
                    (“the appellant”) against the decision of the Judicial
                    Commissioner (“the JC”) in Suit No 834 of 2008 in dismissing
                    his claim against Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore branch (“the
                    respondent”) for damages for breach of contract, and in giving judgment
                    for the respondent for the sum of US$1,135,239.43 for its counterclaim against
                    the appellant for payment of his outstanding liabilities with interest and costs
                    (see <em>Lam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank AG</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 896 (“the GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The material facts are as follows. In November
                    2007, the appellant became a private banking client of the respondent. He signed
                    the following agreements with the respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     an agreement called “Deutsche
                        Bank Master Agreement for Foreign Exchange Transactions and Derivatives
                        Transactions” dated 28 November 2007 (“the Master
                        Agreement”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     an undated document called “Service Agreement”
                        (“the Service Agreement”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     a Risk Disclosure Statement dated
                        28 November 2007, for all types of accounts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     a Security Agreement dated
                        28 November 2007 (“the Security
                    Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Subsequently the appellant signed two
                    other documents, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     a Short Term Facilities/Foreign
                        Exchange Facility dated 21 July 2008 (“the Short Term/Foreign
                        Exchange Facility”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     a Declaration of Pledge (First Party) dated 28 August
                        2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Master Agreement is intended to apply to all
                    transactions between the respondent (referred to therein as “the
                    Bank”) and the appellant (referred to therein as the
                    “Counterparty”) as the recital states that the respondent and the
                    appellant “have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more
                    transactions (each a “Transaction”) that are or will be governed
                    by this Master Agreement”. Clause 9 of the Master Agreement provides that
                    the respondent and the appellant may “enter into such Transactions under
                    this Agreement as they may from time to time determine” and that such
                    Transactions include, without limitation, the following: (a) FX
                    Transactions and Currency Option Transactions; (b) Equity Option and Equity
                    Swap Transactions; (c) Swap Transactions; and (d) Other
                    Transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Clause 2.5 of the Master Agreement provides
                    that each Transaction shall not become effective until the Counterparty has
                    signed the respondent’s Service Agreement and other documents requested by
                    the respondent from time to time (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>
                    below for the text of cl 2.5). The Service Agreement provides, <em>inter alia</em>, for the granting of credit facilities to the
                    customer. Pursuant to this provision, the respondent granted to the appellant a
                    credit line of United States Dollar (“USD”) 200,000,000 on the
                    terms of the Short Term/Foreign Exchange Facility (see [2(e)] above). The credit
                    facilities granted to the appellant under the Short Term/Foreign Exchange
                    Facility were secured (or collateralised) by the appellant’s currency
                    deposits held by the respondent under the Security Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In connection with or pursuant to these two
                    agreements, the appellant opened two accounts with the respondent: (a) a
                    Private Wealth Management Account (Account No 6017180) (“the Advisory
                    Account”); and (b) a Foreign Exchange Gem Account (Account No
                    2658540). In this appeal, only the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement
                    are material to the issues raised by the parties. As will be seen, the legal
                    relationship between the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement is crucial
                    to the determination of the issues arising in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s Transactions with the respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Transactions that the appellant entered into
                    with the respondent that are relevant to this appeal were foreign exchange
                    (“FX”) contracts made under a “Carry Trade Investment
                    Strategy”. This strategy involved the appellant in arbitraging on the
                    interest rate differentials between different currencies. The appellant would
                    buy currencies carrying low interest rates and convert them into other
                    currencies carrying higher deposit interest rates, and thereby lock in a
                    guaranteed gain from these differences in interest rates. However, as is common
                    knowledge, this kind of carry trade also carries with it the risks associated
                    with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies
                involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The appellant is a knowledgeable and
                    sophisticated currency arbitrageur. As will be seen, he appeared to have a
                    better understanding of how foreign exchange market worked than the
                    respondent’s officers who were servicing his trading account (<em>ie</em>, the Advisory Account). The currencies which the
                    appellant was allowed to trade in under the Short Term/Foreign Exchange Facility
                    covered 23 currencies. However, in this appeal, the relevant currencies are
                    Australian dollars (“AUD”), Swiss Francs (“CHF”),
                    Japanese Yen (“JPY”) and New Zealand dollars
                    (“NZD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The material events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In early October 2008, the foreign exchange
                    market became very volatile and the relevant exchange rates of the currencies of
                    the appellant’s Transactions started to move against him. On
                    7 October 2008, the respondent faxed to the appellant a letter (“the
                    7 October 2008 letter”) informing him that his “collateral
                    availability” in relation to his currency deposits in AUD and NZD were
                        “<em>Negative</em> USD610,000”. This
                    collateral shortfall increased the next day. On 8 October 2008, the
                    respondent faxed another letter (“the 8 October 2008 letter”)
                    to the appellant informing him that based on that morning’s rates of AUD
                    0.7084, NZD 0.6248, JPY 101.30 and CHF 1.1416, there was “a shortfall in
                    [the appellant’s] account approximating USD2.3mil”. Both letters
                    contained the following note:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is not an official bank’s statement or advice and is not a
                        substitute for our official statements or advices. This summary is prepared
                        for you as a service to provide account information and is intended for
                        discussion purposes only. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The meaning of the note is clear beyond any doubt. Thus, the two
                    letters were not demands for additional collateral or for any action to be taken
                    by the appellant <em>vis-à-vis</em> his financial position
                    with the respondent. They were intended for information and discussion purposes
                    only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It is not disputed that while there was a
                    collateral shortfall in the appellant’s account on 7 and 8 October
                    2008, his account remained in “positive equity” (<em>ie</em>, the mark-to-market value of his liabilities to the
                    respondent was less than the market value of his collateralised assets).
                    However, on 10 October 2008, the shortfall increased further to around USD
                    5,460,370.02, resulting in the appellant’s account having “negative
                    equity” of USD 1,054,612.74 as well (<em>ie</em>,
                    the mark-to-market value of his liabilities exceeded the market value of his
                    collateralised assets). In other words, if the appellant’s assets were
                    liquidated on 10 October 2008, the proceeds from the liquidation would not
                    have been sufficient to cover his liabilities to the respondent. This was not
                    the case between 7 and 9 October 2008 when the appellant’s account
                    remained in positive equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This led to the respondent faxing another
                    letter to the appellant dated 10 October 2008 (“the 10 October
                    2008 letter”) which stated, <em>inter alia</em>, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer to the ... Master Agreement ... and the ... Service Agreement ...
                        (together, “the Agreement”) ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the terms of the Agreement, you have agreed to maintain the value of
                        the Collateral pledged to us at not less than 100% of your Total Exposure to
                        us. We wish to advise you that there is a current shortfall of <b>USD5,460,370.02</b> between the Collateral Value and
                        your Total Exposure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, we request that you take immediate steps to restore the
                        shortfall in the Collateral Value <b>by 5pm Singapore time
                            today</b>. You may either provide additional security to us or
                        reduce your Total Exposure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would also
                        like to bring to your attention that during this interim period when the
                        shortfall is outstanding, we reserve all our rights under the Agreement,
                        which include without limitation the right without prior notice to terminate
                        early and close out your outstanding contracts and sell any or all of your
                        property or collateral and apply the sale proceeds (after deduction of
                        costs) to discharge your liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The said letter was faxed to the appellant at
                    about 11.15am (reflecting the appellant’s collateral position with the
                    respondent at around that time). At 4.32pm, the respondent’s relationship
                    manager, Ms Cynthia Chin Mei Lin (“Ms Chin”) telephoned
                    the appellant. During this conversation, Ms Chin told the appellant that
                    the respondent would not close out his account immediately, but only that he
                    should give a commitment to remit additional funds (to his account) to cover the
                    negative equity by 13 October 2008. Ms Chin also estimated that the
                    loss which the respondent would suffer if all of his FX contracts were closed
                    out on that day would be about USD 1 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At 5.06pm, Ms Chin telephoned the
                    appellant and told him that she had no authority to “sit on this one
                    million” negative equity position overnight, unless the appellant made a
                    commitment to remit additional funds to his account by 13 October 2008.
                    During this conversation, the appellant protested that the respondent had no
                    right to ask for such a commitment as he had been promised a 48-hour grace
                    period (“the Grace Period”) for any margin call by the respondent.
                    Ms Chin acknowledged that such a promise had been made, but replied that
                    the respondent could close his account immediately if it did not want to do
                    business with him. The appellant refused to give the commitment Ms Chin
                    wanted because (as he later candidly admitted in his evidence) he knew that he
                    would not be able to honour the commitment by 13 October 2008 (because even
                    if he had funds in other banks, he would not be able to remit the funds as it
                    needed two business days to do so: see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    below). At 7.19pm, the appellant informed Ms Chin that he was unable to
                    remit any money to cover the negative equity. He proposed to Ms Chin that
                    his FX positions be closed out partially on that day, and the rest on
                    13 October 2008 (which was the next business day for trading in the foreign
                    exchange market) to reduce his Total Exposure temporarily. At 7.53pm,
                    Ms Chin telephoned the appellant to inform him that his proposal had been
                    rejected and that the respondent would close out the various FX contracts in his
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 13 October 2008, the respondent faxed
                    the appellant a summary of the Transactions it had done on 10 October 2008
                    to close out his FX contracts, and followed it up with a letter of demand dated
                    13 October 2008 which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer to the ... Master Agreement ... and the ... Service Agreement ...
                        (together, the “Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and our rights
                        thereunder, and following our notice of demand dated <b>10 October 2008</b>, we have executed various foreign
                        exchange conversion with respect to your cash deposits and have applied
                        proceeds from the foreign exchange conversion towards reducing your
                        outstanding liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding the above, we would like to inform you that as at
                            <b>13 October 2008</b>, there is still an
                        outstanding amount of <b>USD1,135,239.43</b> unpaid.
                        Interest shall continue to accrue on the said amount until full

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The appellant rejected the demand and instead
                    commenced the present proceedings against the respondent for damages for breach
                    of duty in not closing out some of his FX contracts in a timely manner as he had
                    instructed Ms Chin to do and also in closing out all his FX contracts on
                    10 October 2008. The respondent countered by filing a counterclaim for the
                    amount of USD 1,191,779.27 (later amended to USD 1,206,738.59) being the net
                    amount due from the appellant. The appellant denied liability on the ground the
                    respondent was estopped from closing out his FX contracts on 10 October
                    2008 during the Grace Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The material issues which came before the JC
                    for decision were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>(a) whether the three letters dated 7, 8 and
                        10 October 2008 were margin calls under the Master Agreement and/or the
                        Service Agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2">(b)  whether the respondent had
                        given the Grace Period to the appellant, and if so, whether it was bound by
                        it, and therefore estopped from closing out his FX contracts until the
                        expiry of the Grace Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the basis of the evidence adduced before
                    him, the JC found as a fact that the respondent did (through the
                    respondent’s managing director, Mr Torsten Linke
                    (“Mr Linke”)) give the appellant the Grace Period to decide
                    how to respond to any margin call. However, he also held that the letters dated
                    7 and 8 October 2008 were in the nature of margin calls and that therefore
                    the Grace Period expired on 10 October 2008 when the respondent closed out
                    all of the appellant’s FX contracts. At [15]–[16] of the GD, the JC
                    addressed the legal issues, hypothetically or provisionally, in this way:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    If the only valid margin call by the [respondent]
                            occurred on 10 October 2008 (which was a Friday) as alleged by the
                            [appellant], then the earliest the [respondent] was entitled to close
                            out the [appellant’s] FX positions would be either first thing in
                            the morning of 13 October 2008 (if the 48-hour grace period
                            applies) or after 11.15am on 13 October 2008 (if cl 2.6
                            applies).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16 However, if the [respondent] had made an earlier valid margin call on
                        either 7 or 8 October 2008, the [appellant’s] submission would be
                        rendered moot because even if either or both the 48-hour grace period or
                        cl 2.6 had applied, the FX positions which were closed out at 8.00pm on
                        10 October 2008 would have been validly closed in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After analysing the terms of the Master
                    Agreement and the Service Agreement as well as hearing the evidence of the
                    witnesses, the JC made the following findings at [73] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By reason of the above findings, I hold that the [appellant’s] claim
                        fails at every level. First, at the threshold level, I find that the
                        [respondent] did make a valid margin call on 7 October 2008. On that
                        ground alone, the [appellant’s] claim must stand dismissed with costs.
                        Secondly, even if the margin call was only made on 10 October 2008 and
                        not 7 October 2008 (contrary to my finding), cl 2.6 of the Master
                        Agreement did not govern the margin call and even if it did, it would
                        nonetheless not have assisted the [appellant] in the light of his own
                        unequivocal confirmation that he was unable and or unwilling to deliver
                        additional collateral to clear the margin shortfall even if time was
                        extended to 14 October 2008. Finally, and even though I found that the
                        48-hour grace period was promised to the [appellant], the case based on
                        promissory estoppel would suffer the same fate for the same reason given the
                        [appellant’s] confirmation that he would not have been able to deliver
                        the additional collateral even if the grace period was extended beyond the
                        48-hour grace period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that although this passage made no reference to the
                    8 October 2008 letter, the JC had found, at [24] of the GD, that the Grace
                    Period in relation to the 8 October 2008 letter would also have expired on
                    10 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The issues for our decision are the same as
                    those set out at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above. We will now
                    address them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the letters dated 7, 8 and 10 October 2008 margin
                calls?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first issue is whether the three letters
                    were, or in the nature of, margin calls under the Master Agreement and/or the
                    Service Agreement. The JC held that all three letters were margin calls for the
                    following reasons (see the GD at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the appellant admitted that because
                        of the shortfall of USD 610,000, the respondent was entitled to close the
                        Advisory Account on 7 October 2008;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     the appellant had instructed Ms Chin at
                        4.59pm on 7 October 2008 to place a “Limit Order” to sell
                        AUD 10 million for CHF at the AUD/CHF exchange rate of 0.8413 for
                        the purpose of reducing the shortfall;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     the appellant gave similar instructions to Ms Chin
                        on 8 October 2008 with respect to selling his NZD for JPY for the same
                        purpose; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     the appellant’s own conduct showed that he, as a seasoned FX
                        investor, knew exactly what he was required to do when his account fell into
                        margin shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     With respect, we are unable to agree with the
                    JC’s approach in determining the legal rights of the respondent under the
                    letters dated 7 and 8 October 2008. In our view, these two letters were
                    clearly not margin calls and were not intended as margin calls. They were
                    notifications, to the appellant, of his “collateral availability”
                    (the 7 October 2008 letter) and his Advisory Account shortfall (the
                    8 October 2008 letter), and were “for discussion purposes
                    only”. Having regard to the note contained in each letter (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), the contents of the letters were
                    self-explanatory. We do not agree that the appellant’s admissions and
                    instructions referred to at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above are
                    capable of conferring rights on the respondent under the 7 and 8 October
                    2008 letters if the letters themselves carry no such rights. The
                    appellant’s admissions or instructions to Ms Chin to take action on
                    his FX contracts cannot change the meaning or purport of the said letters. The
                    instructions given to Ms Chin on 7 and 8 October 2008 could only have
                    been given pursuant to the invitation to discuss the appellant’s FX
                    positions. Hence, those instructions were not an admission of the
                    respondent’s contractual rights to close his FX positions without notice,
                    and those letters were not notices. Furthermore, as will be seen, the admission
                    said to have been made by the appellant occurred during the various
                    conversations between the appellant and Ms Chin after he had received the
                    10 October 2008 letter which requested him to “take immediate steps
                    to restore the shortfall in the Collateral Value by 5pm Singapore time [that
                    day]”. The transcripts of these conversations show clearly that the
                    appellant denied that the respondent was entitled to close his FX positions
                    until the expiry of the Grace Period to respond to the margin call. The
                    instructions of the appellant to Ms Chin to close some of his FX positions
                    were an attempt to meet the respondent’s request to reduce his Total
                    Exposure, nothing more. A seasoned currency arbitrageur, like the appellant,
                    would be expected to act in that way, even in the absence of any margin call, if
                    he felt that the exchange rates were moving against him. Even the respondent
                    itself did not consider the 7 and 8 October 2008 letters to be margin calls
                    because the letter of demand dated 13 October 2008 (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) made no reference to the 7 and
                    8 October 2008 letters but only to the 10 October 2008 letter as the
                    basis for closing out all of the appellant’s FX positions. The JC’s
                    findings were clearly inconsistent with the express words of the 7 and
                    8 October 2008 letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the other hand, we agree with the JC that
                    the 10 October 2008 letter was a margin call as it was expressed to be so
                    (the appellant does not dispute this). This letter would have been entirely
                    superfluous if the previous two letters had been margin calls. It was an express
                    notice to the appellant to “either provide additional security” or
                    to “reduce [his] Total Exposure”, then amounting to USD
                    5,460,370.02, which was the shortfall between the Collateral Value of the
                    appellant’s securities and his Total Exposure (the expressions
                    “Collateral Value” and “Total Exposure” are defined
                    in the Service Agreement under the section “<em>Credit,
                        banking and foreign exchange facilities</em>”). Although the
                    10 October 2008 letter gave the appellant until 5pm to respond to it, he
                    did so by telephoning Ms Chin to discuss the steps needed to be taken by
                    him to meet the request. His proposal of a partial closing out of his FX
                    positions (involving NZD 20 million), and the rest on 13 October 2008, in
                    order to reduce his Total Exposure was rejected. According to him, he was
                    hopeful (from his experience) that after the G7 meeting scheduled for that
                    weekend (<em>ie</em>, 11 and 12 October 2008), of
                    which the respondent was aware, the currency market would turn in his favour. He
                    was proven correct, as the exchange rates of the currencies he traded in did
                    move in his favour on 13 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement applicable to the 10 October 2008
                letter?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The next issue is whether cl 2.6 of the
                    Master Agreement applied to the 10 October 2008 letter. If it did, the
                    appellant would only be obliged to deliver any additional collateral requested
                    by the respondent “within one business day’s notice”. It is
                    not disputed that the 10 October 2008 letter would not comply with
                    cl 2.6 as it only gave the appellant up to 5pm to provide additional
                    collateral or to reduce his Total Exposure. In the event, the JC held that
                    cl 2.6 did not apply to the 10 October 2008 letter. His reasons are
                    set out in the GD at [34]–[39]. But before we examine these reasons, it is
                    necessary that we first examine cl 2.6 (as well as cl 2.5) of the
                    Master Agreement to see what they expressly provide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Clauses 2.5 and 2.6 of the Master
                    Agreement provide as follows:</p>

                            which the Bank may now or hereafter hold from the Counterparty. ... For

                                deliver such additional collateral</em>, such failure shall
                            constitute an Event of Default in respect of the Counterparty pursuant
                            to Clause 5 below and <em>the Bank may proceed to
                                terminate some or all of the Transactions at its discretion pursuant
                                to Clause 5 without further notice</em> to the Counterparty
                            other than the notice of termination to be provided under Clause

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Master Agreement, as its name implies, is
                    intended to apply to foreign exchange trading and derivatives transactions.
                        <em>Prima facie</em> therefore, it applies to the
                    appellant’s FX contracts. But, as stated in cl 2.5, no Transaction
                    (defined as any transaction between the respondent and the counterparty under
                    the Master Agreement) is effective <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    respondent until and unless the Service Agreement has first been signed –
                    the signing of the Service Agreement is a condition precedent to the
                    respondent’s obligations under the Master Agreement. In other words, the
                    Service Agreement becomes part and parcel of the Master Agreement, or vice versa
                    with respect to any Transaction made under the Master Agreement. There is no
                    room to read the Service Agreement as an agreement completely divorced from the
                    Master Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Under cl 2.6, the respondent has the
                    absolute discretion to prescribe the amount of the margin and the collateral
                    that the appellant must provide at any time and from time to time, and <em>if the respondent deems the collateral to be
                        insufficient</em>, the appellant must deliver additional collateral
                    “within one business day’s notice”. The appellant is
                    entitled to be given one business day’s notice to meet such an obligation
                    – this is implicit or inherent in cl 2.6. The expression
                    “business day” is not defined in the Master Agreement, but in the
                    Service Agreement, it is defined (under the section “<em>Bank statements</em>”) as “a day other than Saturday or
                    Sunday on which banks and/or foreign exchange markets are open for business in
                    Singapore and/or such other financial centres as [the respondent] may
                    choose”. Clause 2.6 also provides that a failure to provide
                    additional security shall constitute an Event of Default under cl 5 of the
                    Master Agreement, on the occurrence of which the respondent may terminate any
                    one or more or all outstanding Transactions at its sole discretion on the date
                    specified. An “Event of Default” in cl 5 refers to six
                    events, including “any Event of Default (as defined in the Service
                    Agreement)” as provided by cl 5.1(c). These cross-references
                    reinforce the conclusion that the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement
                    have to be read together with respect to each Transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The JC accepted the appellant’s argument
                    that the Master Agreement was applicable to all of the appellant’s
                    Transactions, but he nevertheless held that this legal fact did not
                    “inexorably lead to the conclusion that the margin call made by the
                    [respondent] on 10 October 2008 was necessarily governed by
                    cl 2.6” (see the GD at [33]). He held that cl 2.6 of the Master
                    Agreement did not apply to the 10 October 2008 margin call because it was
                    not made pursuant to cl 2.6, but under the Service Agreement, and therefore
                    the appellant was not entitled to the one business day’s notice to meet
                    the margin call in the 10 October 2008 letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Let us now examine the JC’s reasons,
                    which he set out at [34]–[39] of the GD as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    To understand the
                            purport of cl 2.6, a close examination of the clause is
                            essential:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    It entitled the [respondent] to require the
                                [appellant] to deliver additional collateral if the [respondent]
                                should deem for any reason that the existing collateral was
                                insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The entitlement to require additional
                                collateral was to cover present or future obligations of the
                                [appellant] to the [respondent].</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    The one business day notice was for the
                                [appellant] to deliver additional collateral of a type and in an
                                amount as required by the [respondent].</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Failure to deliver the additional collateral
                                would constitute an event of default which would entitle the
                                [respondent] to terminate all of the [appellant’s]
                                transactions at its discretion without further notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    On the face of
                            cl 2.6, the [respondent] was entitled to require the [appellant] to
                            deliver additional collateral even if the account was not in a margin
                            shortfall. This is clear from cl 2.6 which entitled the
                            [respondent] to require the [appellant] to bring in additional
                            collateral if the [respondent] should deem that the existing collateral
                            was insufficient for whatever reason. Furthermore, the fact that the
                            additional collateral to be delivered is to satisfy future obligations
                            lends support to the construction that cl 2.6 is applicable even if
                            the account is not in margin shortfall. When cl 2.6 was dissected
                            in this manner, counsel for the [appellant] candidly accepted that
                            cl 2.6 would apply even when the account was not in margin
                            shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    It follows that
                            when the [appellant’s] account fell into margin shortfall between
                            7 and 10 October 2008, there was no necessity for the [respondent]
                            to rely on cl 2.6. It is important to recognise that cl 2.6 is
                            not designed to give the [appellant] time before the [respondent] could
                            close the FX positions when the account is in margin shortfall. Instead,
                            cl 2.6 confers a right on the [respondent] to require the
                            [appellant] to deliver additional collateral in such an amount if the
                            [respondent] so requires. The one business day notice only comes into
                            play if the [respondent] should decide to invoke cl 2.6 and not
                            otherwise. Counsel for the [appellant] submitted that while cl 2.6
                            would apply even if the account was not in margin shortfall, it is
                            nevertheless wide enough to cover a situation when the account was in
                            such shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    The
                            [respondent] submitted that it was contractually entitled to close out
                            the [appellant’s] FX positions under the Advisory Account at any
                            time and without notice. The [respondent] relied, <em>inter alia</em>, on the Service Agreement which provides as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Credit banking and foreign exchange facilities</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">1.    We may (but need not) grant you credit banking
                                and foreign exchange facilities (‘Facilities’) in
                                accordance with the terms of this Service Agreement and other terms
                                as may be agreed. All Facilities are made available on an
                                uncommitted basis and subject to the provision of adequate
                                collateral. We may at any time and from time to time vary, suspend
                                or terminate any or all Facilities without prior notice. In such
                                event, all your Liabilities under the Facilities shall become
                                immediately due and payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">2.    Any payment relating to the Facilities not made
                                when due shall bear interest at such rate as we may reasonably
                                determine. Such interest shall accrue and be calculated daily from
                                and including the due date until but excluding the actual payment
                                date. Such interest may be capitalised by us monthly, and itself
                                bear interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.    We have the right to determine the total value
                                of collateral we consider acceptable (‘Collateral
                                Value’).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">4.    We may assign a lower Collateral Value to
                                collateral denominated in currencies different from the currencies
                                of our exposure to you to take into account our currency exchange
                                rate risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">5.    The Collateral Value must not be less than 100%
                                of the Total Exposure [as defined below] at any time.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">6.    If at any time, the Collateral Value is less
                                than 100% of the Total Exposure, we may exercise our Rights on
                                Termination. We may (but need not) allow you time to restore the
                                Collateral Value to more than 100% of the Total
                            Exposure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    It is clear that
                            under the Service Agreement, the [appellant] was required to ensure that
                            the Collateral Value, which is the value of the [appellant’s]
                            collateral as determined by the [respondent], must not be less than 100%
                            of his Total Exposure and if it is less than the requisite 100%, the
                            [respondent] may terminate the transactions under the Advisory Account
                            without providing any time to the [appellant] to restore the shortfall.
                            This was not only undisputed by the [appellant] but was admitted to be
                            so in his AEIC and under
                            cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    Although
                            the [respondent’s] letter dated 10 October 2008 referred to
                            both the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement, it is clear from
                            the language of the letter that the [respondent’s] notice to the
                            [appellant] to clear the shortfall (not to deliver any specific
                            additional collateral) was made pursuant to the Service
                            Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    It specifically referred to the requirement
                                for the [appellant] “to maintain the value of the Collateral
                                pledged to us at not less than 100% of your Total Exposure to
                                us”. This mirrors the requirement under cl 5 (Credit
                                banking and foreign exchange facilities) of the Service
                                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Clause 2.6 would apply in a situation
                                when the [respondent] invokes the right to direct the [appellant] to
                                deliver additional collateral of a type acceptable and in an amount
                                required by the [respondent]. Not only was cl 2.6 not referred
                                to, the letter did not specify any amount which the [appellant] was
                                required to deliver. It merely required the [appellant] to clear the
                                shortfall by either providing additional collateral or reducing his
                                Total Exposure to the [respondent].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     To summarise the reasoning in the above
                    passages, the JC essentially took the position that cl 2.6 was “not
                    designed to give the [appellant] time before the [respondent] could close the FX
                    contracts when the account [was] in margin shortfall” (see the GD at
                    [36]). Rather, “cl 2.6 [conferred] a right on the [respondent] to
                    require the [appellant] to deliver additional collateral in such an amount if
                    the [respondent] so [required]” (see the GD at [36]). The one business
                    day’s notice only applied where the respondent decided to invoke
                    cl 2.6. In his view, the 10 October 2008 letter was a request to clear
                    the shortfall under the Service Agreement because it mirrored the language of
                    the Service Agreement in referring to maintaining not less than 100% of the
                    appellant’s Total Exposure. Accordingly, cl 2.6 of the Master
                    Agreement did not come into play. On the other hand, cl 6 of the
                        “<em>Credit, banking and foreign exchange
                        facilities</em>” section in the Service Agreement provides that
                    if at any time, the “Collateral Value is less than 100% of the Total
                    Exposure, [the respondent] may exercise [its] Rights <em>on</em> Termination” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With respect, we again are unable to agree
                    with the JC’s approach in interpreting the 10 October 2008 letter as
                    having been given under the Service Agreement and not the Master Agreement for
                    the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, as both the Master Agreement
                        and the Service Agreement apply to each Transaction (cl 2.5 of the
                        Master Agreement provides for it expressly), cl 2.6 of the Master
                        Agreement would apply to the 10 October 2008 letter unless it has been
                        excluded by the Service Agreement. There is nothing in the Service Agreement
                        which excludes the operation of cl 2.6 of the Master
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        the Service Agreement does not <em>expressly</em>
                        authorise the respondent to terminate the appellant’s account or to
                        close out his FX positions <em>without giving any
                            notice</em> to the appellant, even in a situation where
                        “the Collateral Value is less than 100% of the Total
                        Exposure”. The Service Agreement provides (under the
                            “<em>Remedies</em>” section) that it
                        is only on the occurrence of an Event of Default that the respondent
                        may:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">1. Terminate this Service Agreement whereupon all [the
                            appellant’s] Liabilities will become immediately due and
                            payable</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">2. Terminate early and close out ... all outstanding contracts</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Clause 1 (under the “<em>Security</em>” section) provides that “[the
                        respondent] may require [the appellant] to provide security for [the
                        appellant’s] Liabilities (sometimes at very short notice in view of
                        market movements)”. Clause 9 (under the “<em>Events of Default</em>” section) provides that it
                        is an Event of Default if there is any “[f]ailure to provide any
                        additional collateral when [the respondent] require[s]”. It is
                        implicit or inherent in this provision that prior notice must first be given
                        to the appellant to provide additional collateral, as otherwise no failure
                        to provide security could arise. This raised the question of how much notice
                        is required to invoke the right of termination. There are only two
                        possibilities. First, if cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement applies, a
                        failure to comply with a one business day’s notice is sufficient to
                        cause an Event of Default. If cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement does not
                        apply, then cl 9 (of the Service Agreement) would require, according to
                        established principles of interpretation, reasonable notice. This approach
                        is consistent with the structure of the Master Agreement read with the
                        Service Agreement with respect to each Transaction they apply to. It also
                        accords with commercial sense, as it would be surprising if, in the business
                        of wealth management, banks could give themselves the right to close their
                        clients’ accounts without giving any notice at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the respondent served the
                        10 October 2008 letter on the basis that both the Master Agreement and
                        the Service Agreement applied to the margin call because it referred to them
                        expressly.The fact that no reference was made specifically to cl 2.6 of
                        the Master Agreement was neither here nor there: it did not make cl 2.6
                        any the less applicable, as there was no need to mention the clause itself.
                        If the respondent intended to make the margin call under the Service
                        Agreement only, it would not have referred to the Master Agreement. The
                        respondent should know under which agreement it was invoking its rights to
                        make the margin call.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the 10 October 2008 letter expressly required the
                        appellant to “take immediate steps to restore the shortfall in the
                        Collateral Value <b>by 5pm Singapore time
                        today</b>”, and to do so by providing “<em>additional security to [the respondent] or [by reducing] [his]
                            Total Exposure</em>” [emphasis added]. The letter expressly
                        requested additional collateral in terms of the ambit of cl 2.6. No
                        doubt, the Service Agreement also refers to the reduction of his Total
                        Exposure. But there is no difference in substance between reducing the
                        shortfall and providing additional security to reduce the shortfall –
                        one is only the means to achieve the other. In the present case, cl 6
                        of the “<em>Credit, banking and foreign exchange
                            facilities</em>” section (reproduced at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above) does not refer to a
                        “shortfall” but to the restoration of “the Collateral
                        Value to more than 100% of the Total Exposure”, and this can only be
                        done by providing additional collateral. We see no inconsistency between
                        cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement and any of the provisions of the Service
                        Agreement in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     Finally, if there is any doubt as to whether cl 2.6
                        of the Master Agreement was applicable to the 10 October 2008 letter,
                        there is no reason why the court should not apply the <em>contra proferentum</em> rule of construction for the benefit of
                        the appellant. The respondent cannot be allowed to rely on any ambiguity in
                        its own documentation to its own advantage to deny the appellant any rights
                        at all in this respect. This rule of construction applies not only to the
                        interpretation of contractual terms within a single document but also across
                        two or more documents if they are both connected with the transaction in
                        question, as in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For these reasons, we are of the view that
                    cl 2.6 applied to the 10 October 2008 letter, and under that clause,
                    the appellant was entitled to one business day’s notice to restore the
                    state of his account to the satisfaction of the respondent, either by providing
                    additional collateral or by reducing his Total Exposure. Accordingly, we find
                    that the respondent was in breach of its obligations to the appellant in closing
                    out all his FX positions on 10 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We should add, just to put the
                    appellant’s conduct in its proper perspective, that the evidence shows
                    that the appellant was trying very hard to comply with the terms of the
                    10 October 2008 letter by seeking to stagger the closing out of his FX
                    positions. He had four conversations with Ms Chin after receiving the said
                    letter and had wanted Ms Chin to reduce his Total Exposure by closing out
                    some of his FX positions first and the rest on the following Monday,
                    13 October 2008. However, Ms Chin was not authorised to agree to carry
                    out the appellant’s suggestions as the respondent had already made up its
                    mind to close out all of his FX positions on that day because of the
                    deteriorating situation in the foreign exchange market. For example, the
                    telephone conversation recorded at 7.19pm is as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<em>What was the legal effect of the
                    respondent’s promise of the Grace Period?</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As we have stated earlier, the JC found that
                    Mr Linke had promised the appellant, at a meeting between them sometime in
                    July 2008, that the appellant would have the Grace Period to respond to any
                    margin call, but he concluded that, in law, the promise did not operate as an
                    estoppel against the respondent insisting on its strict contractual rights as
                    the appellant had not relied on the promise to his detriment such as to make it
                    inequitable for the respondent to resile from that promise. The respondent has
                    not appealed against the factual finding of the existence of the promise, but
                    the appellant has appealed against the legal finding that there was no
                    promissory estoppel. Therefore, the issue before us is whether the JC’s
                    decision on this issue is correct in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In coming to this finding, the JC examined the
                    divergent case law on the subject and concluded that the main reason for this
                    state of affairs was that the courts had given different meanings to the
                    requirement of detrimental reliance. He referred to Spencer Bower, <em>The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation</em> (Piers
                    Feltham et al eds) (LexisNexis UK, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2004)
                        (“<em>Bower</em>”) at p 481 where
                    detriment was described to mean: (a) incurring expenditure of money and
                    time; (b) incurring a liability; (c) change of position; and
                    (d) deprivation of a benefit (see [55]–[56] of the GD). At [57] of
                    the GD, the JC stated the following overarching principle of promissory estoppel
                    which he was able to distil from the divergent case law and academic
                    opinions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, it will not be helpful to attach labels to
                        properly characterise “detriment”. The overarching principle
                        in each of these categories is that the doctrine has consistently been held
                        to apply in circumstances when it was inequitable either in the narrow or
                        broader sense of “detriment” for the promisor to resile from
                        his promise and to enforce his strict legal rights. This was after all the
                        foundation of the doctrine as developed in [<em>Thomas Hughes
                            v The Directors of the Metropolitan Railway Co</em> (1877)
                        2 App Cas 439] (<em>per</em> Lord Cairns at
                        448):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]f parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms
                            involving certain legal results - certain penalties or legal forfeiture
                            - afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a
                            course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties
                            to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be
                            enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, <em>the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights
                                will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable
                                having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between
                                the parties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Applying the overarching principle he
                    identified, the JC held that the appellant had failed to prove that he had
                    suffered any detriment in relying on the respondent’s promise of the Grace
                    Period so as to make it inequitable for the respondent to resile from its
                    promise. He held that the appellant’s remittance of additional funds to
                    the respondent to secure his FX contracts was not detrimental to him, as he had
                    not alleged that he had suffered any financial loss or other detriment in
                    transferring the additional funds (see the GD at [65]). He also held that the
                    appellant had not suffered any detriment in having been denied the Grace Period
                    as he had not been willing and able to deliver additional collateral, and that
                    would have been the case even if 72 hours had been given to him to meet the
                    margin call. The JC’s reasons are set out at [64]–[67] of the GD as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    The inquiry is not
                            simply whether the [appellant] had relied on the promise but whether the
                            reliance had rendered it inequitable for the [respondent] to go back on
                            its promise and to enforce its strict legal rights under the Service
                            Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    For promissory
                            estoppel, the reliance must be linked to the “detriment”.
                            In the present case, I agree with the [respondent]'s submission that
                            there is an obvious disconnect between the pleaded reliance and the
                            alleged detriment. The [appellant] alleged that he remitted additional
                            funds to the [respondent] some two to three months after the promise.
                            However, the [appellant] is not alleging that he suffered detriment in
                            transferring the additional funds. It was for the [appellant] to decide
                            how and what he wished to do with his deposits including the additional
                            funds which were remitted in September 2008. The [appellant] instead
                            alleged that he suffered detriment in that he was denied more time to
                            restore the margin shortfall.</p>

                            resiled from its promise, he would have been ready, willing and able to
                            deliver additional collateral to clear the shortfall within the 48-hour
                            grace period. If that had been the [appellant]'s case, at least there

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With respect, we are unable to agree with the
                    JC’s decision and his reasoning as set out in these passages. In our view,
                    the JC took an overly narrow view of detrimental reliance in the present context
                    of promises made by bank officers when soliciting private banking clients. The
                    appellant was the respondent’s “private banking” client, a
                    description that signifies the importance of the appellant to the respondent as
                    a desirable source of its business (and revenue). The appellant’s business
                    was not insignificant for an individual in the wealth management industry in
                    Singapore. The respondent had given him a credit line of USD 200 million to
                    enable him to engage in the carry trade. The buying and selling of currencies is
                    a profitable business. Further, according to the appellant, he had traded more
                    than 10 currency options through the respondent,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and the respondent would
                    have earned considerable fees for executing them. The respondent would also have
                    benefitted considerably from the large cash deposits which the appellant had
                    placed with the respondent as security for his Transactions. His Total Exposure
                    on 10 October 2008 was equivalent to NZD 88 million.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In
                    our view, the respondent’s word should be its bond in the context of this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is trite that under a system of floating
                    currencies, exchange rates are unstable as they are determined by many factors,
                    and therefore the FX market can become very volatile at times. For this reason,
                    the more time given to the customer to close out any outstanding FX positions
                    the better for him, and conversely, the worse it might be for the respondent. A
                    48-hour grace period (which could be stretched to mean two business days) for
                    such purposes is thus a very valuable right or privilege to a sophisticated
                    customer like the appellant, as it gives him more time to decide what to do
                    – to take his losses immediately, to average down his investment by buying
                    more FX contracts, or as in the present case, to maintain his FX positions until
                    the next business day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the present case, the appellant wanted to
                    partially close out his FX contracts (<em>ie</em>, NZD 20
                    million on 10 October 2008 and the balance of NZD 68 million on
                    13 October 2008) in order to reduce his Total Exposure as requested by the
                    respondent. He explained that, from his own experience in FX trading, the
                    foreign exchange market was more likely than not to move in his favour because
                    the next business day would be after the conclusion of the G7 meeting scheduled
                    for that weekend. It would seem that the respondent was fearful that the
                    appellant’s FX positions would deteriorate further, thus increasing his
                    exposure to the respondent. Hence, the respondent was determined to close out
                    all his FX positions on 10 October 2008 after the 5pm deadline, which it
                    did. As it turned out, the appellant’s reading of the FX market after the
                    G7 meeting was correct – the market did move in favour of the appellant on
                    13 October 2008 – in contrast to the apparent panic exhibited by the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The JC held that the appellant’s
                    transfer of funds from other banks to the respondent as security did not
                    constitute a “detriment” to him in the context of promissory
                    estoppel. However, the appellant did more than that. In our view, there was
                    sufficient detrimental reliance by the appellant as he changed his position:
                    (a) by obtaining a very substantial credit line from the respondent to give
                    business to the respondent; and (b) by providing collateral (which he had
                    to transfer from his accounts with other banks) to the benefit of the
                    respondent. Without the benefit of the Grace Period to allow him to decide on
                    the best course of action if and when a margin call is made, he might not have
                    exposed himself to such large FX positions. In the present case, the respondent
                    made the wrong move in closing out the appellant’s FX positions
                    prematurely and against his wishes, and caused a substantial loss exceeding USD
                    1 million in his net FX positions, which the respondent has now claimed from
                    him. In our view, there was sufficient detrimental reliance by the appellant
                    that made it inequitable for the respondent to resile from its promise to honour
                    the Grace Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We are also unable to agree with the
                    JC’s view that because the appellant was unwilling and/or unable to
                    provide additional collateral for the shortfall, even if the Grace Period had
                    been extended to 72 hours (<em>ie</em>, up to
                    14 October 2008), it was not inequitable for the respondent to enforce its
                    strict rights under the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement (assuming
                    that cl 2.6 was not applicable). In our view, the appellant’s refusal
                    in this respect would not affect his legal rights. If he was entitled to the
                    Grace Period to respond to the 10 October 2008 letter, he was under no
                    obligation to give the commitment that Ms Chin required. Furthermore, the
                    appellant had also explained why he could not have fulfilled his commitment,
                    even if he had the funds, as at least two business days’ notice was
                    required to transfer such funds. Indeed, in retrospect, the respondent’s
                    insistence on a commitment by the appellant made little practical or commercial
                    sense. The appellant could have easily given a commitment without having any
                    intention of honouring it in the knowledge that he would not be able to do so
                    since by 13 October 2008, as explained by him (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> below), he could only effect transfer of funds from another
                    bank (assuming he had such funds) on two business days’ notice. Thus, the
                    commitment served no purpose whatever because the respondent would not have been
                    better off even if the appellant had given the commitment. The respondent would
                    not have gained anything from it. We do not see why the appellant’s
                    candour and honesty in this regard should prejudice his right to insist on the
                    Grace Period in order to provide additional collateral or to reduce his Total
                    Exposure. In fact, as we have stated earlier, the appellant did the only thing
                    that was feasible before the close of 10 October 2008 (<em>ie</em>, to <em>reduce</em> his Total Exposure
                    by closing out partially his FX positions, but not to <em>crystallise</em> his Total Exposure by closing out all his FX
                    positions on that day). Indeed, for this reason, it is arguable that the
                    appellant had complied with the terms of the 10 October 2008 letter, but
                    the respondent was in breach of it by rejecting a partial closing out of his FX
                    positions to reduce his Total Exposure. The respondent, in requesting additional
                    security by 5pm that day, was imposing a requirement that could not be fulfilled
                    in practical terms, and it had to resort to the excuse of a commitment to
                    crystallise the appellant’s Total Exposure instead of reducing it. As this
                    point was not argued, we do not need to rule on it. Nevertheless, we do find the
                    respondent’s conduct in this case rather surprising, given its own
                    acknowledgement that it had given the Grace Period to the
                appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Furthermore, in our view, even if it is
                    arguable that there was no detrimental reliance on the facts on this case, we
                    would hold that the appellant is entitled to succeed in this appeal on the
                    broader principle set out at para V.5.17 of <em>Bower</em>,
                    where it is stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, even adopting such a broad definition of detriment, an exception
                        may be suggested to the rule that detriment is required. It is strongly
                        arguable that a representor may be estopped from denying a representation
                        because it is inequitable for the representor to resile from it, although
                        the representee has suffered no detriment, where the representor has
                        obtained an <em>advantage</em> by the reliance of the
                        representee on the representation, as has been held in relation to
                        constructive trusts, by reasoning equally applicable to the doctrine of
                        estoppel. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The principle is that where the promisor has obtained an advantage
                    from giving a promise to the promisee, he should not be allowed to resile from
                    his promise on the basis of promissory estoppel. We are of the view that this
                    principle is particularly relevant in the context of private banking where if
                    the banks and financial intermediaries engaged in the business of wealth
                    management cannot be trusted with their words, they should not be allowed to be
                    in this business. The courts should not allow a bank to claim that “my
                    word is not my bond”, and should be sufficiently astute to find inequity,
                    and where it is possible to do so within legal limits, to hold the promisor to
                    his word in a case, such as the present, where the respondent has obtained an
                    advantage from his promise at the expense of the promisee. In the circumstances,
                    we find that the respondent was estopped from making the margin call in the
                    terms of the 10 October 2008 letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the appellant accept that the respondent was entitled to close
                out his FX positions on 10 October 2008?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The JC also held that the Grace Period could
                    not prevent the respondent from closing out the appellant’s FX positions
                    as the appellant had accepted the respondent’s right to do so. This
                    finding is set out at [68]–[69] of the GD as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    The [appellant] was

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    Having accepted that the [respondent] was entitled
                            to close his FX positions on 10 October 2008 and the positions were
                            in fact closed on 10 October 2008, it would in fact be unfair for
                            the [appellant] to now raise promissory estoppel to challenge the
                            validity of the margin call transactions. This is all the more so on the
                            facts of this case since it is the [appellant]'s own evidence that the
                            right to close out had accrued on 7 October 2008 and that the
                            [respondent] should have done so some three days earlier. Accordingly on
                            the evidence before me, I find that it was not inequitable for the
                            [appellant] to rely on the terms of the Service Agreement to close out
                            the [appellant]'s FX positions on 10 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     With respect, we do not think that the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In our view, the appellant’s answer
                    (italicised in the extract above at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>)
                    makes it very clear that his other answers were not intended to suggest that he
                    accepted that the respondent had the legal right to close out all of his FX
                    positions without any notice. The appellant’s defence all along had been
                    that first, he was entitled to be given one business day’s notice to
                    provide additional collateral; and secondly, he had, in any case, been promised
                    48 hours to respond to any margin call (whether it arose out of a negative
                    equity position or a shortfall in his collateral position in relation to his
                    Total Exposure). In saying that the respondent could close his account, the
                    appellant was acknowledging a physical fact – that he could not prevent
                    the respondent from closing out his FX positions and offsetting his security
                    deposits since it had custody and control of his funds. But this was a far cry
                    from saying that he accepted that the respondent had the legal right to do so.
                    This can be seen in the questions and answers in the earlier stage of his
                    cross-examination which are reproduced below:</p>

                            that this 48-hours’ grace period is for margin call. You had
                            already been in a margin call situation since 7 October
                            2008?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Disagree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Lam, on 7 October 2008, you’ve
                            agreed with me, that you had an account shortfall and you also stated in
                            your affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the bank can close you out on
                            7 October 2008; right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As I say, the bank must serve me a formal notice.
                            They didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your account shortfall just got worse every day;
                            right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No. On 13 October it reversed, so not every
                            day.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">From 7 to 9 to 10 October, it got worse every
                            day; correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">On those days, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Because it got worse every day, now coming on

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Up to that -- yeah. Not every day. As I said,
                            reversed on 13 October.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So that’s for you to prove; all right,
                            Mr Lam. So on 10 October, the bank was now going to close you
                            out, right, unless you could give a commitment that you would remit
                            money; right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yeah.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So this was all explained to you by Cynthia, about
                            this 48-hours’ notice, that it applies to a margin call situation,
                            but now this is a situation where the bank is really going to close you
                            out; right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Only after the 48 hours –-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I’m saying, Mr Lam, this is what Cynthia
                            explained to you; correct? She explained to you 48 hours is for
                            margin call. You are now in a situation where they can close you out
                            because you are in negative equity; correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s what she told me. I might or might not
                            agree, but at that juncture, I did not want to argue with
                        her.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In our view, these passages show beyond any
                    doubt that the appellant was holding the respondent to the promise of the Grace
                    Period to respond to the margin call. Ms Chin’s statement that the 48
                    hours were for margin calls “<em>but now [the
                        appellant’s account] is close out already”</em> was
                    either incoherent or an acknowledgement that it was too late to give the
                    appellant 48 hours to meet the margin call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the above reasons, we find that the
                    JC’s conclusion that the appellant had accepted that the respondent had
                    the legal right to close out his FX positions on 10 October 2008 is not
                    supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Finally, in addition to the defence of
                    promissory estoppel, there was, in our view, another ground on which the
                    appellant would have succeeded in his claim against the respondent if he had
                    pleaded it. In our view, the respondent’s promise of the Grace Period
                    constituted a variation of cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above) as well as cll 5 and 6 under the
                    section “<em>Credit, banking and foreign exchange
                        facilities</em>” of the Service Agreement (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), with respect to each Transaction of
                    the appellant. The law requires consideration to vary the terms of a contract.
                    The appellant provided consideration when he agreed to do, and did, business
                    with the respondent on those terms – by entering into the relevant FX
                    contracts, which gave both a factual and legal benefit to the respondent (see
                        <em>Ong Chay Tong &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd v Ong Hoo
                        Eng</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 305 and <em>Gay
                        Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</em> [2009]
                    2 SLR(R) 332). This made the respondent’s promise binding and
                    had the effect of varying the relevant terms of the Agreements relating to
                    margin calls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In reliance on the respondent’s promise
                    of the Grace Period, the appellant had also transferred very substantial
                    deposits to the Advisory Account to secure the credit facilities he obtained
                    from the respondent to enter into the very substantial FX contracts. At
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> of the GD, the JC found as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By 11 September 2008, the [appellant] had remitted a total of New
                        Zealand Dollars (“NZD”) 120,101,937.38 and USD3,040,000
                        to his Advisory Account with the [respondent]. A total of Japanese Yen
                        ("JPY") 4,168,423,696 and Swiss Francs
                        (“CHF”) 36,027,548.42 in loans were transferred from the
                        [appellant’s] accounts with Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation and
                        BNP Paribas Private Bank respectively to the [respondent].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The JC held that the transfer of the additional funds did not
                    constitute a detriment for the purpose of promissory estoppel (it was also not
                    pleaded as such). However, this is a question of law, and in our view, the
                    transfer of the funds constituted only one element in the appellant’s
                    decision to become or remain as a private banking client of the respondent and
                    to do business with it on the basis of the Grace Period to meet any margin call.
                    The respondent’s promise of the Grace Period to the appellant was an
                    inducement to him to engage in FX business. The appellant accepted the promise
                    by transferring the funds to provide the requisite security for such trades. In
                    our view, this would be sufficient consideration to make the Grace Period a
                    contractual term of every FX transaction entered into by the appellant, and to
                    that extent, would constitute a valid variation of the relevant terms of the
                    Master Agreement and the Service Agreement in relation to the time required to
                    make a margin call when it is necessary for the respondent to do so. For these
                    reasons, the appellant’s appeal would also have succeeded on this
                    ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     To summarise our findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 7 and 8 October 2008
                        letters were not margin calls;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     the 10 October 2008 letter was a margin call but it
                        was given in breach of cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement (which was part
                        of the Service Agreement with respect to every Transaction of the appellant)
                        in that the respondent failed to give one business day’s notice to the
                        appellant to provide additional collateral to meet the shortfall in his
                        Advisory Account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     in any event, promissory estoppel was applicable to the

                        the Grace Period to respond to the 10 October 2008 letter;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"></a>(d)     in <em>obiter</em>, the promise of the Grace Period constituted
                        a binding undertaking by the respondent to give the appellant 48 hours to
                        meet any margin call, which varied the terms of the Master Agreement and the
                        Service Agreement accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For the above reasons, we allow the
                    appellant’s appeal with costs here and below, with the usual consequential
                    orders. The appellant is entitled to damages, if any, to be assessed by the
                    Registrar on the basis that the respondent was only entitled to close out his FX

<br/>
<em>Lam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank AG<br/>
</em>Civil Appeal No 41 of 2010 <br/>
</strong><br/>
<strong>Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Chan Sek Keong CJ)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background <br/>
</strong><br/>
1     The appellant, Lam Chi Kin David (“Mr Lam”), was a private banking client of the respondent, Deutsche Bank AG (“the Bank”). Mr Lam opened an Advisory Account and a Foreign Exchange (“FX”) GEM Account with the Bank. In connection with these accounts, Mr Lam signed several agreements which included a Master Agreement and a Service Agreement. Pursuant to the Service Agreement, Mr Lam was granted a credit line of USD 200 million, which was secured by his currency deposits held by the Bank under the Security Agreement.</p>
<p>2     The relevant transactions that Mr Lam entered into with the Bank were FX contracts made under a “Carry Trade Investment Strategy”. This strategy involved Mr Lam arbitraging on the interest rate differentials between different currencies. In early October 2008, the relevant exchange rates moved against Mr Lam. On 7 October 2008, the Bank faxed him a letter (“the 7 October 2008 letter”) informing him that his “collateral availability” was “Negative USD 610,000”. This collateral shortfall increased the next day, 8 October 2008, and the Bank faxed another letter (“the 8 October 2008 letter”) to Mr Lam informing him that there was a shortfall approximating USD 2.3 million. </p>
<p>3     On 10 October 2008, the shortfall increased further and this resulted in Mr Lam’s account having “negative equity”. This meant that if Mr Lam’s assets were liquidated on that day, the proceeds from the liquidation would not be sufficient to cover his liabilities to the Bank. This led to the Bank faxing another letter to Mr Lam (“the 10 October 2008 letter”) informing him that the collateral shortfall was USD 5,460,370.02, and requesting that he take “immediate steps to restore the shortfall in Collateral Value by 5 pm Singapore time today”. Later that day, there was a series of telephone conversations between the Bank’s relationship manager, Ms Cynthia Chin (“Ms Chin”), and Mr Lam. Ms Chin told Mr Lam that the Bank would not close out his account if he could give a commitment to remit additional funds by 13 October 2008. Mr Lam protested, on the basis that he had been promised a 48-hour grace period (“the Grace Period”) for any margin call. Ms Chin acknowledged this, but maintained that the Bank could close out his account immediately. Mr Lam declined to give the commitment, and the Bank proceeded to close out all of his FX contracts.</p>
<p>4     On 13 October 2008, the Bank sent a letter of demand to Mr Lam claiming for the outstanding amount of USD 1,135,239.43. Mr Lam rejected the demand and commenced proceedings against the Bank for damages for breach of duty in closing out all his FX contracts on 10 October 2008. The Bank responded by filing a counterclaim for the outstanding amount. Mr Lam denied liability on the ground that the Bank was estopped from closing out his FX contracts on 10 October 2008 during the Grace Period. In the High Court, the Judicial Commissioner found, as a fact, that the Bank had given Mr Lam the Grace Period. However, he also held that the 7 and 8 October 2008 letters were margin calls, and therefore that the Grace Period expired on 10 October 2008 when the Bank closed out Mr Lam’s FX contracts. In the circumstances, Mr Lam’s claim was dismissed and judgment was entered in the Bank’s counterclaim.</p>
<p><strong>The appeal</strong></p>
<p>5     On appeal, the following main issues were raised for the Court of Appeal’s consideration:<br/>
<br/>
(a) Were the letters dated 7, 8 and 10 October 2008 margin calls?<br/>
<br/>
(b) Did the Bank give the Grace Period to Mr Lam, and if it did, was the Bank therefore estopped from closing out his FX contracts before the expiry of the Grace Period?</p>
<p>6     The Court of Appeal held that the express words of the 7 and 8 October 2008 letters made it clear that they were not margin calls, but were notifications to Mr Lam of his “collateral availability” (the 7 October 2008 letter) and his Advisory Account shortfall (the 8 October 2008 letter). Furthermore, both letters contained a note that stated unequivocally that they were intended “for discussion purposes only”. Any admissions by Mr Lam could not be capable of conferring rights on the Bank under the 7 and 8 October 2008 letters if the letters themselves carried no such rights.</p>
<p>7     As for the 10 October 2008 letter, the Court of Appeal accepted that it was a margin call as it was expressed to be so. However, the court also held that clause 2.6 of the Master Agreement, which provides for the giving of one business day’s notice for the delivery of additional collateral, applied to the 10 October 2008 letter. Since the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement applied to each of Mr Lam’s transactions, clause 2.6 would apply unless it had been excluded by the Service Agreement. There was nothing to this effect in the Service Agreement. Furthermore, the Bank had served the 10 October 2008 letter on the basis that both the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement applied as it referred to them expressly, and the 10 October 2008 letter had expressly requested additional collateral in terms of the ambit of clause 2.6. In the circumstances, there was a breach of clause 2.6 as the Bank failed to give Mr Lam one business day’s notice (from 10 October 2008) to provide the additional collateral. </p>
<p>8     The Court of Appeal also found that promissory estoppel was applicable to the Bank’s promise of the Grace Period and that therefore, the Bank was estopped from resiling on its promise to allow Mr Lam the Grace Period to respond to the 10 October 2008 letter. Since the FX market could be extremely volatile, a 48-hour grace period is a very valuable right to a sophisticated customer like Mr Lam as it gives him more time to decide what to do when a margin call is made. There was sufficient detrimental reliance as Mr Lam changed his position by obtaining a substantial credit line from the Bank, and by providing collateral for the Bank’s benefit. Without the promise of the Grace Period, Mr Lam might not have exposed himself to such large FX contracts. Even if it was arguable that there was no detrimental reliance, Mr Lam was entitled to succeed on the broader principle that where the promisor has obtained an advantage from giving a promise to the promisee, he should not be allowed to resile from his promise. This principle was held to be particularly relevant in the context of private banking where, if banks and financial intermediaries engaged in the business of wealth management cannot be trusted with their word, they should not be allowed to be in this business. </p>
<p>9     For these reasons, the Court of Appeal allowed Mr Lam’s appeal, and ordered that his claim for damages be remitted for assessment by the Registrar on the basis that the Bank was only entitled to close out his FX positions on 13 October 2008 at the earliest. <br/>
