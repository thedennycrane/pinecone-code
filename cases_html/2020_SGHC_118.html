Consistent with the design of and the philosophy behind the Model Law, an award debtor has a choice of remedies. In other words, an award debtor may actively apply to set aside the award before the seat court, or passively seek to resist recognition or enforcement of the award before the enforcing court (<span class="font-italic">PT First Media</span> at [65] and [71]).

</div> Consequently, the Defendant submits, leave to enforce the Award should be refused having regard to Article 36(1)(b)<span class="font-italic">(ii) </span>of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal Principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As mentioned at [4] above, it is common ground between the parties that the same grounds available to a party seeking to resist enforcement of a foreign award as set out in Article 36(1) of the Model Law are available to a party resisting enforcement of a domestic international award under s 19 IAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Both parties had argued their respective cases on the basis that if an award was made in breach of natural justice, enforcing it would be against the public policy of Singapore. As such, in considering this ground, I have proceeded on the <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> that if natural justice was indeed breached in the making of the Award and prejudice was thereby suffered by the Defendant, allowing its enforcement would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore. Although it does not directly impact upon the outcome of this case, I express some reservations about the parties’ asserted legal position, for the reasons elaborated below. Nevertheless, as this point was not fleshed out by either party during the hearing, I make no decision on it and leave it to be decided in an appropriate case where the court is assisted with full submissions on the point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23  It is settled law that a party seeking to challenge an arbitral award on the basis that it is against public policy must specifically identify the public policy that, by virtue of upholding the arbitral award, would be  breached (<span class="font-italic">Sui Southern Gas </span><span class="font-italic">Co Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power Co (Pte) Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1 (<span class="font-italic">“Sui Southern Gas”</span>) at [44]; <span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan) </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 443 at [25]). The concept of public policy in the IAA has been discussed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi</span>”) at [59]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the concept of public policy of the State is not defined in the Act or the Model Law, the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public policy under the Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view, it should only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would “shock the conscience” (see <span class="font-italic">Downer Connect</span> ([58] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [136]), or is “clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public” (see <span class="font-italic">Deutsche </span><span class="font-italic">Schachbau v Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd</span> [1987] 2 Lloyds’ Rep 246 at 254, per Sir John Donaldson MR), or where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice: see <span class="font-italic">Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Societe Generale de L’Industrie du Papier (RAKTA)</span> 508 F 2d 969 (2nd Cir, 1974) at 974. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The principles enunciated above apply equally to a case where enforcement of an arbitral award is resisted on the basis that it would be contrary to public policy. As such, it may not be sufficient for a party to simply assert that if there was a breach of natural justice in the making of an arbitral award, enforcing it would, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, be contrary to the public policy of Singapore. A party should identify, with adequate specificity, the public policy alleged to have been breached and how allowing the enforcement of that arbitral award would be contrary to <span class="font-italic">that</span> particular public policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In its written submissions, the Defendant submitted that if the court finds that there has been a breach of natural justice, it “would be empowered to set aside the Award on the grounds that the enforcement of the Award would be against the public policy of Singapore.”

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">AJU</span>, the Court of Appeal stated (at [66]):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In this connection, we would reiterate the point which this court made in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa</span> ([27] supra) at [53]–[57], <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that even if an arbitral tribunal’s findings of law and/or fact are wrong, such errors would not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> engage the public policy of Singapore. In particular, we would draw attention to the following passage from [57] of that judgment:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… [T]he [IAA] … gives primacy to the autonomy of arbitral proceedings and limits court intervention to only the prescribed situations. The legislative policy under the [IAA] is to minimise curial intervention in international arbitrations. Errors of law or fact made in an arbitral decision, per se, are final and binding on the parties and may not be appealed against or set aside by a court except in the situations prescribed under s 24 of the [IAA] and Art 34 of the Model Law. While we accept that an arbitral award is final and binding on the parties under s 19B of the [IAA], we are of the view that <span class="font-italic">the [IAA] will</span><span class="font-italic"> be internally inconsistent if the public policy provision in Art 34 of the Model Law is construed to enlarge the scope of curial intervention to set aside errors of law or fact. For consistency, such errors may be set aside only if they are outside the scope of the submission to arbitration. In the present context, errors of law or fact, per se, do not engage the public policy of Singapore under Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law when they cannot be set aside under Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage recognises the reality that where an arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to decide any issue of fact and/or law, it may decide the issue correctly or incorrectly. <span class="font-weight-bold">Unless its decision or decision-making process is</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> tainted by fraud, breach of natural justice or any other vitiating factor, any errors made by an arbitral tribunal are not per se contrary to public policy.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 From the last sentence in the passage quoted above, there appears to be some support in <span class="font-italic">AJU </span>that a breach of natural justice can be encapsulated within the public policy ground as a basis on which enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused. However, it does not, in my view, stand for the wider proposition that recognising or enforcing an award made in breach of natural justice would, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto, </span>necessarily be contrary to the public policy of Singapore in <span class="font-italic">every</span> case. As stated at [22], the parties did not address me fully on this point. As my decision does not turn on this point, it is unnecessary for me to consider it any further.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In any event, both parties were in agreement that I could have regard to the grounds set out in Article 36(1) of the Model Law (see [4] above). I am therefore of the view that I can consider, in the alternative, whether the Leave Order should be set aside on the basis of Article 36(1)(a)<span class="font-italic">(ii)</span> of the Model Law, namely that enforcement of the Award should be refused on the basis that the party against whom the Award was invoked (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>. the Defendant) was otherwise unable to present its case. Even though this ground was not specifically raised in SUM 6442 or in the Defendant’s affidavits, both parties nevertheless argued their cases comprehensively on the basis of the breach of natural justice ground. There is therefore no injustice or prejudice that would be caused to the Defendant (or for that matter, the Plaintiff) if this court were to consider whether enforcement should be refused pursuant to Article 36(1)(a)<span class="font-italic">(ii)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Model Law<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Pos Ad Sdn Bhd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18] in the context of the court’s powers to allow an unpleaded claim being raised).  Given the manner in which the parties argued their respective cases, Article 36(1)(a)<span class="font-italic">(ii)</span> of the Model Law<span class="font-italic"> </span>would, in my view, have been more relevant since that particular provision specifically encompasses the breach of natural justice ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Either way, I now move on to consider the applicable legal principles in respect of the breach of natural justice ground, on which both parties presented detailed submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It must now be considered hornbook law that a party challenging an arbitral award on the ground that there has been a breach of natural justice must establish all of the following elements (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span>”) at [29], reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure</span>”) at [48] and <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC</span>  [2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>”) at [86]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) which rule of natural justice has been breached;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) how it was breached;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) how the breach prejudiced the rights of the challenging party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The approach of the courts to challenges to arbitral awards (or their enforcement) based on the breach of natural justice ground is undergirded by the overarching principles of limited curial intervention and recognition of the autonomy of the arbitral process (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>at [65(c)]). As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AJU</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [65], the “policy of the IAA is to treat IAA awards in the same way as it treats foreign arbitral awards where public policy objections to arbitral awards are concerned”, and as such, findings of fact made in an IAA award are “binding on the parties and cannot be reopened except where there is fraud, <span class="font-italic">breach of natural justice</span> or some other recognised vitiating factor” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 From the cases that have come before the courts, it is possible to distil a number of specific principles and pointers regarding the overall approach adopted by the courts when dealing with a challenge to an award based on a complaint of breach of natural justice. These principles would apply with equal force to an application to resist the recognition or enforcement of an arbitral award. Drawing together various strands from the cases, I would summarise some of the more pertinent points as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the burden on the party seeking to persuade the court to intervene, whether to set aside or refuse enforcement of an arbitral award, is a high one and it is only in exceptional cases that a court will find that threshold crossed (<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> at [87]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the standard of proof for such a challenge is on the balance of probabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Beijing </span><span class="font-italic">Sinozonto Mining Investment Co Ltd v Goldenray Consortium (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 1 SLR 814 at [48] on s 31(4) of the IAA in respect of whether enforcement of a foreign arbitral award would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore; see also <span class="font-italic">Denmark </span><span class="font-italic">Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/S I Likvidation v Ultrapolis 3000 Investments Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 661 at [43], <span class="font-italic">Strandore</span><span class="font-italic"> Invest A/S and others v Soh Kim Wat </span>[2010] SGHC 151 at [23] and <span class="font-italic">Galsworthy Ltd of the Republic of Liberia v Glory Wealth Shipping Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 727 at [11] in respect of refusing enforcement of a foreign arbitral award under s 31(2) of the IAA, which requires the challenging party to prove grounds that are largely identical to those enumerated in Article 36(1)(a) of the Model Law);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an arbitral award is to be read generously and in a reasonable and commercial way, in the sense that the general approach of the courts is to strive to uphold the award; in this context, consideration may be given to the eminence of the arbitrator in his or her field and experience in the area of law concerned (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span>  [2013] 4 SLR 972 (<span class="font-italic">“TMM”</span>) at [44] - [45] citing <span class="font-italic">Atkins Limited v The Secretary of State for Transport</span> [2013] EWHC 139 (TCC) and <span class="font-italic">Zerma</span><span class="font-italic">lt Holdings SA v Nu-Life Upholstery Repairs Ltd</span> [1985] 2 EGLR 14);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) flowing from (c), an arbitral award should be read supportively, meaning it should be given a reading which is likely to uphold it rather than to destroy it (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span> at [59]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the corollary of (d) is that it is not the court’s function to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically in its attempt to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral process (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span> at [65(f)]; in short, the court should not nit-pick at the award (<span class="font-italic">TMM</span> at [45]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the overarching inquiry (which must be contextual and based on the facts and circumstances of each case) is whether the arbitral process was conducted in a manner that was fair, and whether what was done (or not done as the case may be) by the arbitral tribunal culminating in the arbitral award fell within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done (<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> at [104(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 With these various principles in mind, I turn to the first ground on which the Defendant seeks to set aside the Leave Order, namely, that allowing the Award to be enforced would be against the public policy of Singapore by reason of the breach of natural justice in the making of the Award. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First Objection: The Arbitrator Excluded Evidence of Pre-contractual negotiations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The gravamen of the Defendant’s complaint is that there was a breach of natural justice as the Arbitrator decided to exclude evidence of pre-contractual negotiations in interpreting Clause 11 of the MOA. The Defendant’s case is that the Arbitrator did so without inviting parties to make any submissions on the admissibility of such evidence, and in particular, whether Clause 15 of the MOA, an entire agreement clause, precluded the use of such evidence.

The Defendant had, for example, highlighted the principles in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen </span>[2017] 1 SLR 219 and argued that various facts asserted by the Plaintiff were based on <span class="font-italic">inadmissible</span> extrinsic evidence and should be excluded for purposes of contractual interpretation.

</div> I accept that the focus of the Defendant’s closing submissions was on whether the facts asserted by the Plaintiff had been sufficiently pleaded and/or particularised (as opposed to the effect of Clause 15). Nonetheless, the point remains that the general question of whether extrinsic evidence was admissible to aid the Arbitrator in the interpretation of Clause 11 of the MOA was an issue which the Defendant had submitted on. That issue was therefore clearly within its contemplation. Further, the Defendant also presented submissions on the relevance of extrinsic evidence, including pre-contractual evidence, to advance its own case on when the grant of the loan facilities took place.

I say so for three reasons. First, the Arbitrator’s decision was aligned to the primary position of the Plaintiff in the Arbitration and by reason thereof, could not be said to be surprising or unforeseeable. Second, the Arbitrator was entitled to decide on the question of admissibility of pre-contractual evidence without calling for submissions from the parties. Third, any potential impact that Clause 15 of the MOA could have on the Arbitrator’s decision-making should have been foreseeable to the parties. I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The Arbitrator’s decision was not surprising or unforeseeable</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The crux of the dispute between the parties centred on whether Clause 11(a) and/or 11(b) of the MOA applied and in particular, how the words “the grant of the loan facilities” that appeared in both sub-clauses were to be construed; that was the decisive issue in the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Based on a reasonable and commercial reading of the Award, it is clear enough to me that the position taken and conclusion reached by the Arbitrator on the decisive issue of the interpretation of Clause 11(a) of the MOA was, ultimately, aligned to the <span class="font-italic">primary position</span> of the Plaintiff in the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The primary position of the Plaintiff, as fleshed out in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, its Opening Statement and closing submissions, was that the wording of Clause 11(a) of the MOA was clear and unambiguous and that primacy should be given to the text of the words used.

In summarising the law in this area, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [65(d)] stated that:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In so far as the right to be heard is concerned, the failure of an arbitrator to refer every point for decision to the parties for submissions is not invariably a valid ground for challenge. Only in instances such as where the impugned decision reveals a dramatic departure from the submissions…might it be appropriate for a court to intervene. In short, there must be a real basis for alleging that the arbitrator has conducted the arbitral process either irrationally or capriciously. To echo the language employed in [<span class="font-italic">Trustees of </span><span class="font-italic">Rotoaira Forest Trust v Attorney-General </span>[1999] 2 NZLR 452], the overriding burden on the applicant is to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award. It is only in these very limited circumstances that the arbitrator’s decision might be considered unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49  In my judgment, the Arbitrator’s reasoning was neither unforeseeable nor surprising. The Arbitrator’s analysis and conclusions on when the grant of the loan facilities took place and consequently, his finding that it was not necessary to consider a contextual interpretation of Clause 11(a), meant, <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pith and substance</span>, that the Arbitrator was agreeing with the Plaintiff’s primary position. This is so even if this may not have been that clearly articulated by the Arbitrator in the Award. It thus cannot be said, in my view, that the Arbitrator’s reasoning or ultimate decision was unforeseeable or surprising or that the manner in which the decision was reached by the Arbitrator was irrational or capricious.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Whilst the Arbitrator may not have considered the pre-contractual extrinsic evidence or invited parties to submit on the applicability or relevance of Clause 15 of the MOA, the reasoning employed and decision reached by the Arbitrator in the Award on the decisive issue did not, in my view, involve any significant or dramatic <span class="font-italic">departure</span> from the parties’ submissions. To put it slightly differently, it could not be said by the Defendant to be unforeseeable or surprising that the Arbitrator would agree or align himself with the Plaintiff’s primary position, and in doing so, find it unnecessary to consider pre-contractual extrinsic evidence in construing the words in Clause 11(a) of the MOA. In my view, that the Arbitrator did not call for submissions on the issue of admissibility of pre-contractual evidence or the applicability of Clause 15 of the MOA is, therefore, in and of itself insufficient to amount to a breach of natural justice that would warrant setting aside the Leave Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Arbitrator was entitled to decide on the admissibility of pre-contractual evidence without calling for submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Further, I find that the Arbitrator was entitled to decide on the question regarding the admissibility of pre-contractual evidence in the interpretation of Clause 11(a) without having to invite the parties to present submissions on the point. I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Before me, Mr Kumarasingam contended that the Arbitrator’s decision to exclude pre-contractual evidence on the basis of Clause 15 of the MOA was wholly unforeseeable as both parties had proceeded on the basis that such evidence was admissible. In support of that contention, Mr Kumarasingam submitted that the Plaintiff’s witness, Mr X, was cross-examined on pre-contractual evidence.

According to the Defendant, it had argued in the specific discovery application that these documents were relevant and necessary for the fair disposal of the proceedings.

Whilst the Arbitrator had allowed discovery on the basis of the Defendant’s assertions as to why the documents were relevant, it nevertheless did not impinge on the Arbitrator’s discretion to decide on the materiality of the evidence or the weight to be accorded to it at a later stage.

Arguments on pre-contractual extrinsic evidence only came into play in the parties’ closing submissions.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Reverting to the cross-examination of the Plaintiff’s witness Mr X, testimonies of witnesses are, ordinarily, only helpful or relevant insofar as they support the pleaded cases of the parties. The relevance (let alone any alleged centrality) of pre-contractual extrinsic evidence was not explained or highlighted by the Defendant in the Arbitration prior to its cross-examination of the Plaintiff’s witness. Moreover, any link or relevance between the pre-contractual extrinsic evidence and the decisive issue was only raised by the Defendant at the stage of closing submissions. As such, it would be incorrect, in my view, for the Defendant to contend that parties had proceeded with the Arbitration on the agreed basis that pre-contractual evidence was admissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As for the Arbitrator allowing the Respondent’s application for discovery, that fact <span class="font-italic">per se</span> does not support the Defendant’s argument that pre-contractual extrinsic evidence was a central feature of the case. Whilst the Arbitrator allowed discovery of some of the extrinsic documentary evidence sought by the Defendant in relation to the financing of the Other Vessels, I agree with the Plaintiff that the Arbitrator’s decision was made on the basis of the Defendant’s submission in the Redfern Schedule that the documents were relevant to why CF did not further extend time to complete the transaction. However, in the Award, the Arbitrator decided that it would be “inappropriate and incorrect to link the financing arrangements of the Other Vessels” with the vessels in question, as the Second TCL and the MOA do not make mention of the Other Vessels.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Final Arbitration Award at para 6.7 </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Quite clearly, at the stage in the Arbitration when the Arbitrator allowed discovery of the said documents, questions of admissibility and weight to be accorded to the documents had not yet arisen. The Arbitrator’s decision to allow discovery of pre-contractual evidence did not mean that such evidence would therefore necessarily feature in the Arbitration or in the Arbitrator’s reasoning when the Award was eventually published. I therefore do not place weight on this argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Even if I were to accept that both parties proceeded on the basis that pre-contractual extrinsic evidence was admissible and relied on it in the course of their closing submissions, the Arbitrator was not bound to simply accept that position without demur. As noted in <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>([31(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [65], an arbitrator is not bound to accept or adopt only the premises put forward by the parties. In addition, an arbitrator is entitled to infer a related premise from an argued premise placed before it, without asking parties to submit new or further arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As held in <span class="font-italic">AQU v AQV</span> [2015] SGHC 26 at [18], the “principles of natural justice are not breached just because an arbitrator comes to a conclusion that is not argued by either party as long as that conclusion reasonably flows from the parties’ arguments”. A particular chain of reasoning would be open to an arbitrator if the links in the chain flow reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or <span class="font-italic">are related to those arguments</span> (<span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro Industries v Agritrade International Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 768 at [156]). Conversely, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), there may be a breach of natural justice if an arbitrator “decides the case on a point which he has <span class="font-italic">invented</span> for himself” (original emphasis) (at [41]), citing Sir Michael J Mustill &amp; Stewart C Boyd, <span class="font-italic">The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England </span>(Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1989) at p 312), and that an arbitrator “should not make bricks without straw” (at [65(a)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 After considering the wording of Clause 15 of the MOA, the Arbitrator opined that the parties had “by contract, precluded themselves and each other from adducing evidence of their pre-contractual agreements or other pre-contractual evidence as an aid to construing Clause 11 of the MOA”.

In the circumstances, the Arbitrator was, in my view, entitled to explore and make a finding on the admissibility point even if the parties did not submit on it and were not asked to.

However, Mr Kumarasingam also submitted that Issues 6, 8 and 9 in the MOI read with paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Statement of Defence, viewed together with how the issues were ventilated during the Arbitration, brought evidence of pre-contractual negotiations and contextual interpretation into the arena.

If indeed Issues 6, 8 and 9 of the MOI read with paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Statement of Defence brought pre-contractual extrinsic evidence and contextual interpretation into the arena, then the question of the admissibility of such evidence would, in my view, reasonably flow from or would, at the very least, be related to those issues in the MOI <span class="font-italic">and</span> the arguments advanced in relation to those issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As such, the Arbitrator was, in my judgment, entitled to consider Clause 15 of the MOA in his reasoning and come to a conclusion on it without first inviting submissions from the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The potential impact of Clause 15 was foreseeable to the parties </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I now move on to consider whether the Defendant could have foreseen or anticipated that the question of admissibility of pre-contractual evidence would form part of the Arbitrator’s decision-making process.

Regardless of the reason for which the parties did not address the issue, the Court of Appeal held that this type of decision “cannot be set aside on the basis of any breach of natural justice because if the parties could reasonably have foreseen that the issue would arise, and if they choose not to address that issue, they cannot complain that they have been deprived of a fair hearing” (at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Plaintiff submitted that the case before me is a Type Three scenario<span class="font-italic">. </span>According to the Plaintiff, Clause 15 of the MOA could reasonably be expected to be relevant to the determination of whether pre-contractual evidence may be admitted to aid in the interpretation of the terms of the MOA.

</div> The Defendant, on the other hand, submitted that the case fell within either a Type One or Type Two scenario. The Defendant argued that this was not a Type Three scenario because the Arbitrator relied on Clause 15 of the MOA to exclude pre-contractual evidence when neither party had submitted on the impact of Clause 15.  According to the Defendant, there was no reason to think that the Arbitrator would adopt that reasoning, as Clause 15 excluded only prior agreements and not pre-contractual evidence. The Defendant reiterated that pre-contractual evidence was a central feature of the Arbitration.

</div> or their pleadings; nor was any clear or specific reference made to such points in the MOI or the Defendant’s opening statement. I have summarised the decisive issue at [41] and it was highlighted by the Arbitrator in the Award as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5.3.12 The Claimants argue that they are entitled to a full refund of the Deposit pursuant to Clause 11(a) and/or Clause 11(b) of the MOA because CF had not approved or had rejected the grant of loan facilities to the Claimants for the purchase of the Vessels.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5.3.13 The Respondents strenuously resist this assertion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Extensive arguments were canvassed by the parties on this issue. After considering the evidence put forth by the parties, the Arbitrator reached his decision on the issue in paragraphs 6.38 and 6.39 of the Award (see [45] - [47] above). I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the Arbitrator’s decision <span class="font-italic">did not</span> turn on the admissibility of pre-contractual evidence or on Clause 15 precluding the use of such evidence. In other words, <span class="font-italic">n</span><span class="font-italic">one</span> of those points was decisive or determinative as far as the Arbitrator’s conclusion on the decisive issue is concerned. For this reason, the present case does not fit easily or comfortably into the Type One and Type Two <span class="font-italic">Glaziers </span>scenarios.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my opinion, this case bears a closer resemblance to a Type Three scenario. As I stated at [61] above, admissibility must logically be a precursor to the question of the impact or relevance, if any, of pre-contractual extrinsic evidence. The question is whether, objectively, on the facts of this case, the potential issue of admissibility or exclusion of pre-contractual evidence was a reasonably foreseeable issue or question that the parties (or more specifically, the Defendant) could or should have anticipated or foreseen. In my judgment, it was. In the circumstances, the Defendant can have no cause for complaint that it was deprived of an opportunity to address the Arbitrator on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72  Adopting <span class="font-italic">Glaziers</span> ([66] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [64], where a party fails (knowingly or otherwise) to apply its mind to and address a reasonably foreseeable issue (<span class="font-italic">even if that issue was subsidiary to </span><span class="font-italic">the ultimate issue before the tribunal</span>), it cannot subsequently complain that it has been deprived of the right to a fair hearing or denied a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Overall, I am of the view that the Defendant is, in reality, seeking an opening to challenge the Award on its merits in the guise of a complaint dressed up as a breach of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I find that there was no breach of natural justice occasioned by the Arbitrator in this case in not inviting submissions from the parties on the admissibility of pre-contractual extrinsic evidence or the effect of Clause 15 of the MOA. This ground of the Defendant’s objection therefore fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) No actual or real prejudice</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Even if I had been persuaded that there was a breach of natural justice, the Defendant’s objection would still fail as it would not be able to show that the Arbitrator’s decision caused its rights to be prejudiced. It is trite that there must be a causal connection or nexus between the alleged breach of natural justice and the making of the award to establish actual or real prejudice (<span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure </span>([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [50], citing <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [86] and [91]). As further elucidated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure </span>at [54], the inquiry is whether as a result of the breach, the tribunal was “denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations” and whether “the material <span class="font-italic">could reasonably</span> have made a difference to the arbitrator rather than whether it <span class="font-italic">would ne</span><span class="font-italic">cessarily </span>have made a difference” (emphasis in original). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On the facts, any alleged breach did not cause the Defendant to suffer any actual or real prejudice.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I note at the outset that in an application such as the one before me, it is not the court’s role to assume the function of the Arbitrator in deciding whether the Arbitrator would have admitted the extrinsic evidence based on the parties’ submissions at [76] – [77] had those submissions been made in the course of the Arbitration (<span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure </span>([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [54]). To do so would be antithetical to the overarching objectives of limited curial intervention and autonomy of the arbitral process that permeate throughout the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79  I also need not be satisfied that a different result would ensue had the Arbitrator received the benefit of submissions on Clause 15 of the MOA. On a close reading of the Award as a whole, it is my view that any submissions on the admissibility of pre-contractual evidence and the impact of Clause 15 were unlikely to have had any impact on the decision of the Arbitrator on Clause 11(a) of the MOA and the words “the grant of the loan facilities” in that clause. The underlying tenor of the Award was that the wording of Clause 11(a) of the MOA was clear and unambiguous and therefore, the Arbitrator needed to go no further and consider pre-contractual extrinsic evidence for context. I agree that in substance, the Arbitrator appeared to have given primacy to the text of the words in Clause 11(a) of the MOA and found the wording clear enough. Therefore, even if the Arbitrator had invited submissions on the admissibility of pre-contractual extrinsic evidence and such evidence was admitted, it could not reasonably have made any appreciable difference to the Arbitrator’s conclusion on the decisive issue. As such, if necessary, I would also dismiss the Defendant’s objection on this ground. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second Objection: Selective Consideration of Matters by the Arbitrator </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The next complaint of the Defendant in terms of the breach of natural justice ground was that “for unknown reasons”, the Arbitrator did not consider its submissions on the interplay between the three sub-clauses in Clause 11 of the MOA, and that the structure of those sub-clauses was important to the interpretation of Clause 11.

The Arbitrator concluded, firstly, that it was “not for the Tribunal to re-write or give sense to clauses in the MOA which might be perceived as not making sense when set against each other”; and secondly, that there was “no difficulty in interpreting the clauses as they stand”, as each sub-clause in Clause 11 of the MOA was “distinct and separate”.

The Defendant’s complaint was, in my view, an unabashed attempt to re-litigate before me the merits of its arguments on the interplay between the sub-clauses in Clause 11. This was, simply put, impermissible under the IAA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For all of the reasons given above, I am of the view that the Defendant has failed to establish its case that, on the balance of probabilities, there was a breach of natural justice in the making of the Award or that by reason thereof, allowing the Award to be enforced would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore. In my judgment, what was done by the Arbitrator in this case fell within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal might have done in those circumstances. I also find that the Defendant has failed to establish that any real or actual prejudice has been suffered by it.

As highlighted at [41], the <span class="font-italic">decisive issue</span> placed by the parties before the Arbitrator for his determination centred on the interpretation of Clause 11(a) and/or 11(b) of the MOA and the meaning to be ascribed to the words “the grant of the loan facilities” contained therein. The Defendant argued that pre-contractual extrinsic evidence was relevant, and indeed, central to aid the interpretation of Clause 11 of the MOA. If so, it must logically follow that the Arbitrator <span class="font-italic">was </span>acting within his jurisdiction in considering the <span class="font-italic">admissibility</span> of pre-contractual extrinsic evidence and the effect of Clause 15 of the MOA in the process of coming to a decision on the decisive issue.

For the same reasons given at [75] to [79] above, even if I were to accept that the Arbitrator’s decision to exclude evidence of pre-contractual negotiations fell outside the scope of the terms of reference, the Defendant has, in my view, suffered no real or actual prejudice.
