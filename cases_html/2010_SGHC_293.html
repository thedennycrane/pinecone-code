The works were broken down into Part A, for $350,000 and Part B, for $222,000. It will be convenient to briefly set out a break down of the works and the contract sums against each item:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The Defendant subcontracted the whole of the works to the Plaintiff by a letter dated 30 July 2004 for a lump sum of $543,400. The 5% difference in price from the sum of $572,000 was for the Defendant’s profit and attendance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Defendant used its own subcontract form and this subcontract agreement was also dated 30 July 2004. The subcontract period of 6 months from 27 August 2004 to 26 February 2005 mirrored the period stipulated in the main contract between the Defendant and the Town Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Disputes arose between the Parties during the course of the subcontract works. In essence, the Plaintiff complained that their interim monthly payments, although certified and paid to the Defendant by the Town Council, were being unjustifiably withheld by the Defendant in breach of their contractual obligation to make payment within 10 days of payment by the Town Council. On the other hand, the Defendant complained that the Plaintiff had insufficient labour at site; was falling unacceptably behind in their progress of the works; lost their project manager and did not replace him and caused these and other complaints to be registered by the consultant, E M Services Pte Ltd (“the Consultant”) against the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Alleging a repudiatory breach by non-payment of Payment Certificates Nos. 2 and 3, the Plaintiff terminated its subcontract and abandoned the works on 10 January 2005. The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff had repudiated the contract by stopping work without justification on 10 January 2005 and accepted their repudiatory breach. In addition, the Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff was in breach of their subcontract by failing to carry out their works diligently and with due expedition, resulting in the Defendant having to take over parts of their works; failed to have a competent project manager; and failed to rectify their defective works. The Defendant also alleged that the Consultant had documented the defaults of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The disputes were referred to arbitration in February 2006. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) appointed Mr John Chung as the sole arbitrator (“the Arbitrator”), on 6 March 2006. The arbitration hearing was held on 31 August, 1, 3, 4 and 10 September 2009, written closing submissions were made on 8 October 2009 and reply submissions on 5 November 2009 and the Arbitrator published his award on 1 February 2010 (the “Award”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Arbitrator ruled in favour of the Defendant, finding and holding as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiff had wrongfully terminated the subcontract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the value of work done by the Plaintiff up to the date of termination was $130,522.87 and after deducting therefrom, the 1<sup>st</sup> Progress Payment of $20,947.50, the sum owed to the Plaintiff for this was $109,575.37;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Defendant succeeded in its counterclaim for having to rectify the Plaintiff’s defective works, taking over the Plaintiff’s works and finishing the project by appointing other subcontractors, thereby suffering loss and damage. This was quantified at $377,798.01 and was arrived at as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">When the sums were set off against each other, ($377,798.01 - $109,575.37), the net result was an award in the favour of the Defendant for $268,223.23. (Although I pause here to note that mathematically the result should be $268,222.64) The Arbitrator also awarded the Defendant the costs of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues of Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is from this Award that the Plaintiff seeks
                    leave to appeal on two questions of law. The questions of law set out in the
                    Originating Summons are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_i"></a>(i)     Whether when a main contractor, who
                        has awarded a back-to-back contract to a sub-contractor and in so doing
                        agreed to pay the sub-contractor progress payments within 10 days of receipt
                        of payment from the employer net only of 5% profit and attendance and
                        specified permitted deductions, delays payment of the 1st progress payment
                        and makes no payment of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th progress payments having
                        received payment from the Employer, has thereby renounced its obligations
                        under the sub-contract, notwithstanding complaints or concerns about the
                        subcontractor’s progress or quality of work that do not constitute
                        permitted deductions under the sub-contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Whether a provision permitting the main
                        contractor to make deductions of “ascertained or contra
                        accounts” can extend to a <em>bona fide</em>
                        counterclaim for <u>unascertained and
                            unquantified</u> damages for breach of
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Question (ii) was amended by the addition of the
                    underlined words “unascertained and unquantified”, pursuant to an
                    oral application to amend made during the hearing by counsel for the Plaintiff,
                    Mr Jeyaretnam SC. This was not opposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Jeyaretnam SC concentrated on the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> issue of law and anchored his arguments on a
                    fairly simple and straightforward proposition. The question of law arose because
                    the Arbitrator seemed to overlook the fact that when the Defendant refused to
                    make payment of Certificates Nos. 2, 3 and 4 when they were due, there was
                    no evidence given by the Defendant of having quantified or having tried to
                    estimate the sum which they were setting off against the Payment Certificates.
                    There was no finding by the Arbitrator on this and yet the Arbitrator accepted
                    the Defendant’s right to set off unliquidated and unascertained sums
                    against sums that had been certified by the Project Consultant and paid over to
                    the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Jeyaretnam SC relied heavily on the
                    House of Lords decision in <em>Gilbert-Ash (Norton) Limited v
                        Modern Engineering (Bristol) Limited</em> [1974] AC 689
                        (“<em>Gilbert-Ash”</em>) where an issue
                    arose as to the main contractor’s ability to set off sums claimed by way
                    of damages for defective works and delays of the subcontractor against certified
                    progress payments to the subcontractor. The relevant clause, clause 14,
                    provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Contractor also reserves the right to deduct from any payments
                        certified as due to the sub-contractor and/or otherwise to recover the
                        amount of any <em>bona fide</em> contra accounts and/or
                        other claims which he, the Contractor, may have against the sub-contractor
                        in connection with this or any other contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the above clause, the official referee held that even if it was
                    narrowly construed, it entitled the main contractor to withhold the balance of
                    the amounts due pending determination of their cross claims for unliquidated
                    damages against the sub-contractor for delay and defective work. The Court of
                    Appeal reversed that decision and on appeal the House of Lords allowed the
                    appeal. Besides overruling the case of <em>Dawnays Limited v
                        F G Minter Limited and Trollope and Colls Limited</em> [1971]
                    1 WLR 1205 (“<em>Dawnays</em>”),
                    the House of Lords held that on its true construction there was no provision in
                    the sub-contract which ousted the right of set off in respect of unliquidated
                    cross claims, and that accordingly, since the sum deducted was related to a
                        “<em>bona fide</em> contra accounts ... or other
                    claims” within the meaning of clause 14, the main contractor was entitled
                    to deduct that sum, pending the determination of the cross claims, from the
                    amounts certified payable to the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr Jeyaretnam SC referred me to the
                    following passage from the judgment of Lord Morris, at 704:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is upon the interpretation [of the above clause] that the present case,
                        in my view, depends. A ‘certified’ payment is clearly a
                        liquidated sum. To have a process of deduction from such a sum <em>there must clearly be some other stated sum</em>. There
                        could, for example, be some other liquidated sum. There could be some other
                        sum which could be regarded as a contra account. <em>But
                            there would have to be some sum</em>. <em>There
                            could not be a deduction of something that lacked any kind of
                            specification</em>. But need the sum to be deducted be a
                        liquidated sum or an ascertained sum in the sense of an agreed sum or of a
                        sum assessed by a court? The wording of the provision does not so indicate.
                        There may be a <em>deduction of the amount</em> of any
                            <em>bona fide</em> claim which the contractor may
                        have against the sub-contractor. Such claim may be in connection with the
                        contract which has occasioned the certified payments or in connection with
                        any other contract. As applied to the facts now before us the position is
                        that the appellants have claims against the respondent in connection with
                        the sub-contract. Those claims have both been particularised and quantified.
                        Their amount is known. Whether or not they can be substantiated it is
                        accepted that as “claims” they have been made in good
                        faith.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">and the following passage of Lord Diplock’s judgment at
                    715:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal, however, felt able to reverse his decision by
                        construing “contra accounts and/or other claims” as limited to
                        “established or admitted liquidated sums”. By
                        “established” they meant determined by and embodied in a
                        judgment of a court of law or an award of an arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, even without the qualifying adjectival phrase “<em>bona fide</em>” the words “contra accounts
                        and/or other claims” in ordinary usage do not, in my view, bear so
                        restricted a meaning; nor am I persuaded by the Court of Appeal that the
                        restriction is justified by the use of the verb “deduct”.

                            words themselves to suggest that the quantification may not be made by

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Right of Set-off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Although it is difficult to give any
                    comprehensive definition of set-off without reference to the various forms it
                    can take, it is in essence the taking of two competing money cross-claims,
                    setting off one against the other and producing a single balance, (see S R
                    Derham, <em>The Law of Set-off</em> Oxford University
                    Press, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2001 at para 1.01)
                        (“<em>The Law of Set-off”</em>). Its
                    early development, under the strictures of the old forms of pleadings and
                    practice at common law, 18<sup>th</sup> Century set-off
                    legislation and the intervention of equity resulted in a tangle that caused
                    Staughton LJ to exclaim in <em>Axel Johnson Petroleum AB v
                        MG Mineral Group AG</em> [1992] 1 WLR 270 (“<em>Axel Johnson”</em>), at 276:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Its historical development has led to results which appear to lack logic
                        and sense. It can be said that there is a case for reform of the law, which
                        has to be discovered in a number of diverse rules based on no coherent line
                        of reasoning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Today we see references to legal set-off, common law set-off,
                    equitable set-off, transactional set-off, independent set-off and the doctrine
                    of abatement. For some categories, the cross-claims need not be connected so
                    long as they are between the same parties, in others they have to be closely
                    connected or arise out of the same transaction. In some, liquidated sums are
                    required and in others unliquidated sums can be set-off against liquidated sums.
                    There are exceptions that apply to one rule but not to another. It was this
                    tangle, combined with Mr Jeyaretnam SC’s usual persuasiveness, which
                    caused me to reserve judgement when I initially thought this application should
                    be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the contract entered into between the
                    Plaintiff and the Defendant, clause 10d of the subcontract conditions reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In accepting this contract, the subcontractor agrees and permits the main
                        contractor to setoff and deduct from the subcontract progress payments, any
                        outstanding invoices and payment due to the main contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and clause 11 of the subcontract conditions, (with all its errors),
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>RIGHTS OF SETOFF</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Main Contractor reserve[s] the right of deducting from any monies due
                        to the subcontractor from subcontractor progress claim (including but not
                        limited to the retention monies held by the Main Contractor) to recover the
                        amount of any ascertained or contra accounts, which the Main Contractor may
                        have against the subcontractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I read clause 10d to allow the main contractor to set-off any payment
                    due to it from the subcontractor’s progress payments. Clause 11 allows the
                    same for “contra accounts”. In addition, the indemnity in Clause 5
                    cannot be ignored, (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The question arises: what is the meaning of
                    “payment due to the main contractor” and “contra
                    accounts”? The latter phrase appeared in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em> and Lord Reid interpreted this phrase to mean
                    “generally itemised accounts not yet agreed.” From the passages of
                    Lords Morris and Diplock, relied upon by Mr Jeyaretnam SC, the set-off must
                    comprise “some sum” and “[t]here could not be a deduction
                    of something that lacked any kind of specification.” Mr Jeyaretnam
                    SC submits that these passages stipulate that quantification is a necessary
                    pre-condition for contractual set-off. There is some commonsense appeal to this
                    proposition because a party must know there is an amount to be set-off before he
                    can say he is deducting or exercising the right to set-off that sum against the
                    sum he owes. But whether that must be a liquidated or unliquidated sum is one
                    question and must it be a liquidated sum at the time of set-off is exercised is
                    yet another question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In construing the contract, the other three
                    Law Lords in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em> referred to
                    “contra accounts and/or other claims” in a general sense and not
                    liquidated sums. Lord Reid said at 698:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I do not see how it can be limited to sums which have
                            either been found to be due or agreed</em>. It refers to <em>bona fide</em> contra accounts. The words
                            “<em>bona fide</em>” would be quite
                        unnecessary and, indeed, meaningless, if the scope of this provision were
                        limited to sums as adjudged or agreed to be due. <em>They</em><em><u>must imply a claim</u></em><em>which a contractor believes to be genuine but which may
                            still be in dispute</em>. And contra accounts are generally
                        itemised accounts not yet agreed. Even if “<u>other
                            claims</u>” could be read as claims <em>ejusdem generis</em> with contra accounts, that would not help
                        the sub-contractor because in this case <u>the claim in
                            respect of bad workmanship and delay</u> are worked out in great
                        detail. It is true that this provision goes a very long way if that is its
                        meaning, because it would allow deduction of all detailed claims outstanding
                        under other contracts. But if the sub-contractor chooses to agree to that,
                        that is his affair.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Lord Reid refers to “sums” and “itemised
                    accounts” which may still be in dispute but referable to ascertained
                    sums, he also refers to “a claim”, which can mean an unquantified
                    claim, especially since he related it to bad workmanship and delay. Loss or
                    damage caused to a main contractor by a subcontractor’s bad workmanship
                    and delay may not be quantifiable at the time of set off and may even have to be
                    quantified by a court or arbitral tribunal although in the case before him it
                    had been worked out in great detail. Viscount Dilhorne’s statements at 711
                    are of similar import:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The above clause] which gives the contractor the right to deduct
                        “the amount of any <em>bona fide</em> contra
                        accounts <u>and/or other claims</u> which he, the
                        contractor, may have against the sub-contractor in connection with this or
                        any other contract” is <em>not, in my opinion, limited
                            to the deduction of amounts which have been agreed between the parties
                            or to amounts calculated by reference to a liquidated and ascertained
                            amount</em>. This, in my opinion, is conclusively shown by the
                        fact that deduction may be made to recover the amount of any <em>bona fide</em> claims the contractor may have against the
                        sub-contractor. If, as I do not think is the case, a contra account is
                        limited to the deduction of agreed or ascertained sums, the amount of any
                            <em>bona fide</em> claim is not. It is admitted in
                        this case that the contractor’s claims against the sub-contractor were
                            <em>bona fide</em>. They were quantified by the
                        contractor and under this clause of the sub-contract the contractor is
                        entitled to deduct them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Salmon similarly said at 724:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Clearly you can have contra accounts</em>
<em><u>or claims</u></em>
<em>which are neither “established” nor
                            “admitted” but which are still contra accounts</em>
<em><u>and claims</u></em>
<em>. I can see no
                            reason for excluding these from the ambit of clause 14 and every reason
                            for including them</em> for, if you exclude them, it is impossible
                        to make any sense of the words “<em>bona
                            fide</em>” which immediately precede them. Nor can I see
                        any difficulty in “deducting” the amount of the
                        contractors’ claim for £4,532.94 which although neither
                        “established” nor “admitted” has been
                        elaborately itemised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is important to note the facts in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em>. The architect had certified £14,532
                    due to the subcontractors. The main contractor paid £10,000 and withheld
                    £4,532 alleging remedial costs for defective steel work, which they
                    quantified at £1,862, and for delays, which was quantified at £3,317.
                    The set-offs totalled £4,999. The issue there was whether, on the
                    subcontract terms, the main contractor was entitled to set-off unliquidated and
                    disputed counterclaims against otherwise certified and undisputed sums due to
                    the subcontractor. At that time, as every student and practitioner in the
                    building and construction industry knows, the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Dawnays</em>, had laid down the principle that sums
                    certified and paid over to main contractors as due to subcontractors must be
                    paid over without deductions or set-offs. The House of Lords in overruling
                        <em>Dawnays</em> held that the subcontract clause there
                    did not oust the right of the main contractor to set-off its “<em>bona fide</em> contra account ... or claim” and it was
                    entitled to deduct the sum that it did, pending the determination of the cross
                    claims from the amount certified as payable to the subcontractor. Clear contract
                    language was needed to exclude this right of set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In <em>Gilbert-Ash</em>
                    therefore, the main contractor had quantified the amounts in detail in respect
                    of delay, defective workmanship and rectification costs before set-off. We
                    cannot tell whether these amounts were quantified at the time the set-off was
                    exercised or at the time of pleadings. The passages relied upon were made in the
                    context of ascertained and quantified but disputed set-offs. If one goes deeper
                    down to questions like what degree of quantification is necessary before a right
                    to set-off arises, or must the quantification be possible at the time of
                    set-off, as compared to time of pleadings, is set-off permissible without any
                    quantification and if so under what kind of circumstances, then the <em>Gilbert-Ash</em> decision and the passages cited above do not
                    provide the answers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The question boils down to this: must a
                    contractor who withholds payment to his subcontractor, claiming a set-off, have
                        <em>some</em> sum in mind, be it an estimate or a sum
                    certain, <em>at the time</em> he withholds payment? Or is
                    it sufficient that he had contra claims in mind when he withheld payment leaving
                    the contra claims to be quantified or ascertained at the time he files his
                    pleadings or, as it can sometimes happen, leaving the contra claims to be
                    quantified or ascertained by a court or an arbitral tribunal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Jeyaretnam SC’s arguments must
                    fail on at least three grounds when looked at from the authorities. First,
                        <em>Gilbert-Ash</em> itself is not an authority for the
                    proposition he seeks to advance on behalf of his clients because the House of
                    Lords expressly recognised the right to withhold certified sums against
                        <em>bona fide</em> unliquidated claims under the phrase
                        “<em>bona fide</em> contra account/ ... or
                    claim” used in the subcontract entered into between the parties. The
                    judgments support the rule that set-offs could be effected, <em>pending</em> the determination of the cross-claims. Further, as it
                    was conceded that the main contractor’s claims were <em>bona fide</em>, Lord Reid said, at 696:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is now admitted, and in my view properly admitted, that at common law
                        there is a right of set off in such circumstances: but that right can be
                        excluded by contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Secondly, and more importantly, the Defendant
                    had the right in equity to set-off any <em>bona fide</em>
                    unliquidated claims. Building contracts and claims in that context clearly
                    fulfil the criteria of contra claims that are so closely connected with the
                    subject matter of the claim that it would be unjust to allow the
                    Plaintiff’s claim without taking into account the Defendant’s
                    set-offs. In <em>The Law of Set-off</em>, the learned
                    author considered the law in respect of cross-claims by the building employer
                    against the contractor for damages for delay and bad workmanship at
                    para 5-49:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A cross-claim for damages for delay or for bad workmanship is capable in
                        principle of being employed in set-off against an amount due for work
                        performed under a building contract. At one time it was thought that a
                        set-off was not available in cases in which the price was to be paid by
                        instalment on the certificate of an architect or engineer, or some other
                        such person. In a series of cases, commencing with <em>Dawnays Ltd v F G Minter Ltd</em> ... [a] claim on the
                        certificate by the contractor against the employer, or by subcontractor
                        against the contractor, could not be met by a set-off or counterclaim in
                        respect of an unliquidated cross-demand ... However <em>Dawnays v Minter</em> ... was overruled some two years later by
                        the House of Lords in <em>Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v Modern
                            Engineering (Bristol) Ltd</em> ... [which] held that there is no
                        presumption in building cases in which the price is to be paid by instalment
                        on certificates that the parties intend that the ordinary defences of
                        set-off and abatement should not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Thirdly, as the learned author alludes, the
                    doctrine of abatement would also apply to building contracts: see <em>eg</em> Lord Morris in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em> at 699 and <em>Hua Khian Ceramics
                        Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd v Torie Construction Ltd</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 901 (“<em>Hua Khian Ceramics
                        Tiles</em>”) at 905-906. The Defendant’s claims for
                    rectifying defective works and providing a supervisor to drive the
                    Plaintiff’s work are classic situations for the application of the
                    doctrine of abatement. These claims can clearly be taken into account as they
                    relate directly to the value of work done by the Plaintiff. Depending on the
                    case and evidence, taking over uncompleted work and the incurring of additional
                    costs therefor can also be factors taken into account in reducing the claims by
                    the subcontractor that it has done that work. There can be no doubt that under
                    the common law doctrine of abatement, a main contractor is entitled to raise an
                    unliquidated claim which, if established, would reduce or extinguish the
                    subcontractor plaintiff’s claim. An obvious example would be the case of a
                    piling subcontractor’s bad workmanship or errors in the foundation which
                    can cause an entire building to be torn down and reconstructed or require
                    extensive and very expensive remedial works resulting in long delays. Lord
                    Morris himself referred to this in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em> at
                    699. In so saying I have not overlooked the fact that the Arbitrator adopted a
                    different route for calculation, perhaps because of the nature of the evidence
                    before him, but the result is the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There is also authority that a party relying
                    on set-off can quantify his set-off at the time of pleadings. There is no
                    authority that requires this quantification to occur <em>before</em> a right of set-off arises. <em>Morley v
                        Inglis</em> [1837] 4 Bing NC 58, involved setting off an unliquidated
                    sum under a guarantee pursuant to the Statute of Set-Off which provided that
                    “where there are mutual debts between the plaintiff and defendant, one
                    debt may be set off against the other, and such matter may be given in evidence
                    upon the general issue, or pleaded in bar as the nature of the case shall
                    require.” In considering this legal set-off under this statute, Tindal CJ
                    said at 71: “It seems to me that the rule by which we are to determine
                    whether or not a demand can become the subject of a set-off, is by inquiring
                    whether it sounds in damages; <em>whether the demand is capable
                        of being liquidated, or ascertained with precision at the time of
                        pleading</em>” (emphasis added). In <em>Axel
                        Johnson</em>, Legatt LJ said at 272:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For set-off to be available at law the claim and cross claim must be
                        mutual, but they need not be connected. They need not be debts strictly
                        so-called, but may sound in damages. The question is ... 'whether the demand
                        is capable of being liquidated or ascertained with precision at the time of
                        pleading.'</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A close examination of authorities like these undermines the strict
                    rule advocated by Mr Jeyaretnam SC that there must be some sum, not an
                    unquantified or general claim, at the time of exercising the
                set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>The Law of
                        Set-off</em> at para 5.51, in the context of contractual
                    exclusion of equitable set-off and abatement in building contracts, the author
                    states that the drafter must bear in mind that a cross-claim for damages for
                    defective workmanship can give rise not only to an equitable set-off but also to
                    the common law defence of set-off. This principle is similarly stated in Philip
                    Wood, <em>English and International Set off</em>, (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 1989) (“<em>English and International
                        Set-off”</em>) at paras 1-20 to 1-21:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Transaction set-off (abatement, equitable set-off and
                            United States recoupment)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Transaction set-off arises where the reciprocal claims flow out of the
                        same transaction or closely connected transactions in circumstances,
                        generally, where the creditor claiming his primary claim has defaulted in
                        performance of the very obligation for which he is seeking payment. Unlike
                        independent set-off, the remedy is self-help and neither claim need be
                        liquidated...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This form of set-off was developed by the common law courts under the name
                        of “abatement” as an exception to the rigours of independent
                        set-off which requires that both claims be liquidated. It was developed
                        separately by the courts of equity under the name of “equitable
                        set-off”... Some slight differences between abatement and equitable
                        set-off may remain... but, as mentioned, the courts have discouraged
                        over-nice distinctions between equity and common law in the field of
                        set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The principles discussed above have been
                    applied in Singapore. In <em>OCWS Logistics Pte Ltd v Soon Meng

                    as he then was, said at [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general, any debt or liquidated sum due from a plaintiff to a defendant
                        can be set off against the plaintiff's claim. This is the legal set-off or
                        independent set-off. An unliquidated claim of the defendant for damages can
                        be set off if it arises from the same transaction as the claim of the
                        plaintiff or is closely connected with the subject matter of the claim: see
                        Hanak v Green [1958] 2 QB 9 and Morgan &amp; Son Ltd v Martin
                        Johnson &amp; Co Ltd [1949] 1 KB 107. This is the principle of equitable
                        set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal has summarised the development of common law and
                    equitable set-off and the doctrine of abatement in <em>Pacific
                        Rim Investments v Lam Seng Tiong</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 643

                    Denning MR also said, at 974-975:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it is not every cross-claim which can be deducted. It is only
                        cross-claims that arise out of the same transaction or are closely connected
                        with it. And it is only cross-claims which go directly to impeach the
                        plaintiff’s demands, that is, so closely connected with his demands
                        that it would be manifestly unjust to allow him to enforce payment without
                        taking into account the cross-claim.</p>

                    which states that the “set-off will need to represent a bona fide known

                    ... and not some possible or even likely future loss” (emphasis added).
                    In the <em>Pacific Rim Investments</em> case, our Court of
                    Appeal quoted, as an “instructive passage”, Goff J in <em>SL Sethia Liners Ltd v Naviagro Maritime Corp</em> [1981]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 18 (“<em>The Kostas
                        Melas”</em>) at 26:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, the exercise of a right of deduction or set-off is
                        essentially an act of self-help; it requires no order of the court or
                        arbitrators for its enforcement. <em>If a party exercises it,
                            however, he must have justification for doing so; and in theory he
                            should be able to prove, at the time of its exercise, that he has that
                            justification</em> ... it is in my judgement implicit in its very
                        nature that it should only be exercised in good faith on reasonable
                        grounds...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The authorities therefore only require the
                    party exercising his right of set-off to have an “entitlement” to
                    a contra claim before he can do so. He must have the
                    “justification” in exercising his right and it must be exercised
                        <em>bona fide</em>. It is for this very reason that
                    Lord Morris said, in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em>: “There
                    could not be a deduction of something that lacked specification”. A party
                    exercising the right to set-off cannot have no idea why he is making a
                    deduction, or withholding payment. He must know of his <em>entitlement</em> to set-off or his <em>justification</em> for doing so even though at that time of
                    exercising his right, he is not able to quantify the set-off. He is exercising
                    his remedy of self-help. Indeed, in the case of an unliquidated contra claim,
                    that party will not know what the eventual figure will be. Of course in many
                    cases, such a party will be able to make a reasonable and <em>bona fide</em> estimate of his contra claims and if his estimate
                    turns out to be wrong, he is not in default, but has to refund the excess. In
                    commenting on the estimation of the quantum of an unliquidated set-off, Philip
                    Wood in <em>English and International Set-off</em> at
                    para 4-27 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The weight of authority favours the view that where a party entitled to a
                        transaction set-off for unliquidated damages quantifies his loss by a
                        reasonable assessment made in good faith and deducts the sum quantified,
                        then he is not in default. <em>One reason is that often the
                            defendant does not have sufficient evidence immediately available to him
                            to quantify accurately. But to protect the claimant, the assessment must
                            be objectively reasonable</em>. If it subsequently turns out that
                        a party has deducted too much, the other party can recover the balance. The
                        same principle applies to both transaction set-off for unliquidated damages
                        and to contractual set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And also Philip Wood, <em>Set-off and Netting,
                        Derivatives, Clearing Systems</em>, (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2007) at para 3-019:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">English decisions decide that, if the debtor quantifies his claim
                        reasonably and in good faith, he is not in default even if his
                        quantification turns out to be wrong. This rule is necessary because
                        otherwise the debtor would be exposed if he did not have sufficient facts at
                        his disposal to quantify the damages by the time the payment from him, such
                        as hire, fell due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the <em>Pacific Rim
                        Investments</em> case, Thean JA stated at [27], referring to
                        <em>The Nanfri</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The majority of the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning MR and Goff LJ, agreed
                        that in the circumstances the appellant charterers were entitled to an
                        equitable set-off and to deduct from the hire, sums as loss arising from the
                        loss of speed because the claims were so closely connected, provided that
                        the unliquidated loss was quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment
                        made in good faith. This was a right quite apart from the contract
                        entitlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This principle was also endorsed in <em>Hiap Tian Soon
                        Construction</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I would go further and say that in the context
                    of a building contract dispute, if it is clear on the facts or <em>it is evident</em> that there is an entitlement or
                    justification, to raise a claim in set-off against the claiming party, and that
                    sum is likely to be so large as to exceed or extinguish the claiming
                    party’s claim, then the lack of an exercise to estimate the amount of the
                    set-off or quantify the same is not fatal nor a disqualification to exercise
                    this self-help remedy. In such an event, the lack of an estimate to satisfy the
                        <em>bona fides</em> and reasonableness falls away.
                        <em>A fortiori</em> if at that time the party asserting
                    a set-off is under great pressure to take over the works and adopt acceleration
                    measures to ensure timely completion or mitigate the length of the delay. Take
                    the case at hand, after approximately 4.5 months into a 6 month contract, after
                    having completed only slightly over one-fifth of the value of the contract,
                    after being clearly in delay, after the main contractor has had to provide a
                    supervisor and then take over some of the works, after unambiguous and strong
                    written complaints by the employer’s project consultant, the subcontractor
                    walks off the site, does the law require the main contractor to sit down and
                    quantify his likely damages before he can withhold payment? It seems evident to
                    me that a defendant in such a position has other priorities, <em>viz</em>, to deal urgently with taking over the works, sort out the
                    material on site and completing the same as soon as he can lest he faces claims
                    or mounting claims for delay damages. As those in the construction industry well
                    know, taking over incomplete works, and under time pressure, is a very messy and
                    unenviable situation. Other subcontractors brought in to finish incomplete work
                    charge a premium for taking on the liability for someone else’s incomplete
                    work and for acceleration. It is also clearly a measure in mitigation caused by
                    the other party who is in default or repudiatory breach of the contract. If so,
                    the entitlement is clearly there and so is the justification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, if the amount withheld or set-off is
                    so large, and later confirmed to be so excessive or so disproportionate to the
                    likely amount of those damages or the counterclaims, then there is the obvious
                    difficulty in proving the <em>bona fide</em> belief in the
                    amount set-off and the party effecting a set-off cannot satisfy the element of
                    reasonableness or that he was justified in so doing. A court will then
                    legitimately ask, did that party claiming the set-off, pause to think about his
                    entitlement or estimate his set-off? Also, “<em>possible</em> future” losses cannot be the basis for a right
                    of set-off, as it cannot amount to an “entitlement” since it must
                    be necessarily speculative in nature, (see <em>A L Stainless
                        Industries</em>). It will then also impinge on the reasonableness and
                        <em>bona fides</em> of the exercise of that right and
                    the amount deducted. In such cases, a court will consider not just the handing
                    over of the excess balance wrongfully withheld but can, in its discretion and if
                    the facts warrant it, consider proper compensation to the injured party for any
                    damages suffered. This is what was meant by Rajah JC (as he then was) in
                        <em>Jia Min Building Construction</em> at [43]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The exercise of these rights have to be bona fide and reasonably made ...
                        The fact that the amount may subsequently turn out to be erroneous will not
                        vitiate the initial basis for exercising the right, <em>though it could lead to other consequences</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It will all depend on the circumstances of each particular
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before I leave the applicable legal
                    principles, I need to deal with <em>Hiap Tian Soon
                        Construction</em>. In this case, the superstructure contractor caused
                    damage to the piles installed by another contractor, which in turn led to
                    substantial delays to the project. The employer withheld subsequent payments,
                    Interim Certificates Nos 8, 9 and 10, following which the contractor
                    terminated the contract and brought a claim for the moneys withheld. The
                    employer disputed the quantum and claimed that it was entitled to an equitable
                    set-off for the defective building work. The learned Judge at [38], endorsed the
                    principle already discussed above, that so long as the party purporting to
                    exercise the right of set-off sought to quantify his loss in a <em>bona fide</em> way by reasonable means, the fact that the
                    estimated figure may eventually turn out to be too high is not, in itself,
                    sufficient to preclude a party from relying on a defence of set-off; the party
                    does not actually have to produce a specific and final figure, quantified by
                    professional quantity surveyors. The project quantity surveyor and the
                    structural engineer had a meeting with the employer prior to the purported
                    termination and the project quantity surveyor gave a verbal estimate of the cost
                    of rectification works “in the region of $200,000”. The employer
                    said he obtained a verbal estimate from a friend in the construction industry
                    that the estimated cost of repairs would be around $300,000, but that person was
                    not called to give evidence. The amount withheld by the employer was
                    $214,196.90. Surprisingly, the learned Judge held that it was “not enough
                    to obtain two casual verbal estimates in passing; at the very least, [the
                    employer] must have had some basis or engaged in some form of rational analysis
                    before coming to an estimate of the costs involved. I find that the two
                    estimates used by [the employer] were not reasonable and that [the employer] had
                    failed to show that the losses had been quantified by means on a reasonable
                    assessment.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I accept that the full facts of the case may
                    not have appeared in the reported judgment and that the issue is very fact
                    sensitive. With great respect to the learned Judge, I find the application of
                    the principles to the reported facts difficult to accept for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the contractor admitted
                        damaging 32 piles and well as some piles in another location (grid 7/A), as
                        a result of his negligent workmanship; this resulted in 158 compensating
                        piles having to be installed. The contractor admitted liability for this
                        remedial work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, it was the project quantity surveyor who produced the estimate of
                        $200,000. Of all people on site, and of all professionals consulted, it
                        would be the project quantity surveyor who would be the one person best
                        informed on prices and cost of reinforced concrete piles and their
                        installation. On top of that, the estimate was made in the presence of the
                        structural engineer and he would be the professional who would be the most
                        knowledgeable party on the employer’s team to know about the type and
                        methods of rectification works. Both these professionals were certainly
                        better placed to form an estimate of the rectification costs as compared to
                        the employer. I fail to see how these two professionals, giving their views
                        in the presence of each other to the owner, who was making “some
                        attempts ... to obtain an estimate of the cost of the rectification
                        works” (at [39]-[40]), can be a mere “casual verbal
                        estimate”. Both of them gave evidence and I do not see any adverse
                        remarks or findings by the learned Judge against them on this score (I
                        accept the possible limitation that the manner in which these witnesses gave
                        their evidence is not in the report). As the second estimate of $300,000 was
                        allegedly verbal and the person giving the estimate was not called to give
                        evidence, I accept that this being fact sensitive, the learned Judge was
                        entitled and correct to characterise this as a “casual verbal
                        estimate”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, the 158 piles were not the only rectification or
                        compensation piles; the learned Judge made a finding that because of the
                        contractor’s submission of inaccurate eccentricity plans, more damaged
                        piles were discovered later (at grids 8/B and 6/A, see [71]), and the
                        learned Judge held that the contractor was also liable for damage to those
                        piles and that must have included their rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, the rectification works were
                        not the only contra claims. The learned Judge found there were substantial
                        delays to the project, which was the building of a factory. It is self
                        evident that superstructure works cannot commence until the foundations and
                        piling damage is rectified. The learned Judge found that the contractor
                        failed to proceed with reasonable diligence was responsible for the delays,
                        damages for which was to be assessed by the registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifthly, the amount withheld was only
                        $214,196.90. The contract sum was $10,090,000 which was later reduced to
                        $7,995,000. The total amount certified was $1,310,661.83 and on the
                        contractor’s own evidence, it had received $952,553.89. This was not a
                        case where there were large sums withheld or sustained non-payment. This
                        $214,196.90 is not an extravagant sum by any measure, especially considering
                        the estimate given by the project quantity surveyor, which was only for
                        rectification/compensatory piles, and did not include delay damages or
                        increased costs of completing the work. There was no allegation of the
                        employer causing delay to the contractor except for an allegation that there
                        was a late handover of the site. The learned Judge held against the
                        contractor and found that there was no delay on this
                    score.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With the greatest of respect, I therefore have my
                    reservations on the correctness of the application of the principles to the
                    facts of that case. The threshold for the <em>bona
                        fides</em> and reasonableness was set far too high.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Although a digression, it is worth noting that
                    by contract, parties can even agree to set-off a future or contingent claim.
                    Thus in banking documents, it is common to find a contractual right to set-off a
                    customer’s credit balance against an unliquidated or a contingent claim.
                    There is no doubt that such clauses are valid and enforceable because all that
                    really means is that there are two contractual rights rolled into one:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a right to withhold payment of the credit balance pending
                        quantification of the claim (whether by agreement, or by judicial decision
                        or by arbitral award), coupled with the right to set off that claim when it
                        has been quantified. In other words, the so-called contractual set-off in
                        relation to unliquidated claims is in effect two rights rolled into one: in
                        the company instance, a right to suspend payment, while leaving the
                        customer’s credit balance intact; and later, when the amount of the
                        claim has become liquidated, a set-off which will result in pro tanto
                        extinguishment of the credit balance ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(see <em>Goode</em> on <em>Legal
                        Problems of Credit and Security</em>, (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) at para 7-22).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts Available to the Arbitrator and his Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Before me, Mr Tan Joo Seng, counsel for
                    the Defendant, candidly accepted that the Defendant did not put forward any
                    evidence during the arbitration of having quantified or estimated his contra
                    claim when it chose not to pay the Plaintiff on the Payment Certificates
                    No. 2 and 3. On the facts, the Arbitrator has not made any findings on the
                    question of <em>bona fides</em> or reasonableness in
                    exercising its rights of set-off. The Award, as it stands, exposes the
                    Arbitrator to criticism that he does not seem to have directed himself to these
                    issues. However, this alone does not entitle the Plaintiff to obtain leave to
                    appeal on a question of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     By the time the dispute reached the
                    Arbitrator, the Defendant was clearly able to quantify its contra claims. Hence,
                    on the evidence of the Defendant, the Arbitrator was able to make an award for
                    the amount spent by the Defendant to complete the works and to rectify the
                    Plaintiff’s defective works. I also note the subcontract included an
                    indemnity clause, <em>viz</em>, for the Plaintiff
                    subcontractor to indemnify the Defendant main contractor for and against certain
                    breaches and omissions (see below <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The following facts appear from the Award and
                    the Affidavits. The subcontract sum was $543,400, the start date was
                    27 August 2004 and the contract completion was 26 February 2005. The
                    Plaintiff purportedly terminated the subcontract on 10 January 2005, some
                    4½ months into a 6 month contract and having, as found by the Arbitrator,
                    carried out only about 20% by value of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Payment Certificate No.1 was for the month
                    ending September 2004 for the sum of $22,050.00 and no dispute arises on its
                    payment. In any case, the Plaintiff accepted there was delay in furnishing a
                    valid performance bond and insurance policy and the Defendant paid the Plaintiff
                    $20,947.50 on 30 December 2004 after the Plaintiff furnished the same. This
                    inordinate delay by the Plaintiff speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Payment Certificate No. 2 for the sum of
                    $31,447.50 was for the month ending October 2004. Payment Certificate No. 3
                    for the sum of $26,617.50 was for the month ending November 2004 and Payment
                    Certificate No. 4 for the sum of $57,277.50 was for the month ending
                    December 2004. The Town Council paid Certificate No. 3 to the Defendant on
                    20 December 2004. The withholding of these three sums under Certificate
                    Nos. 2, 3 and 4 by the Defendant, totalling $109,575.37 was the basis of
                    the Plaintiff’s claim that the Defendant was in breach of the subcontract.
                    However at the time the Plaintiff repudiated the subcontract, 10 January
                    2005, only Payment Certificates No. 2 and 3, (<em>ie</em> totalling $58,065), were due. Payment Certificate No. 4
                    was only certified on 10 January 2005 and the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice
                    for Progress Claim No. 4 is dated 15 February 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     After hearing the witnesses and considering
                    the evidence and the submissions, the Arbitrator held that the Plaintiff had
                    failed to carry out their works with due diligence and expedition and that the
                    Plaintiff was in breach of the subcontract and was in culpable delay. There was
                    ample evidence in the form of letters from the project consultant to the
                    Defendant complaining about the slow progress and delays to the works. He
                    accepted the Defendant’s evidence that the Plaintiff’s slow progress
                    was due to the lack of resources and manpower and this was the subject of
                    written complaints by the project consultant; the Defendant had to assign one of
                    their project managers to the Plaintiff’s works in November 2004; the
                    Defendant did not cause any delaying events which critically affected the
                    progress of the works; although the Defendant was in breach of the payment terms
                    in paying Certificates No. 2 and 3 late, that delay was not so serious as
                    to go to the root of the contract and it did not have the effect of depriving
                    the Plaintiff of the whole benefit under the subcontract. He also held that the
                    Defendant took over and completed the works abandoned by the Plaintiff and Part
                    A was eventually completed and handed over to the Town Council on 31 July
                    2005 and Part B was completed and handed over on 27 December
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There was sufficient evidence before the
                    Arbitrator to make those findings and come to those conclusions that he did. In
                    the Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”), the complaint
                    letters of the project consultants were exhibited. The earliest letter is dated
                    29 October 2004 and it directed the Defendant to arrange for a project
                    manager from its own staff for the project. This was done on 13 November
                    2004 and in a letter dated 13 November 2004 the Defendant informed the
                    Plaintiff that they would be charged $3,000 per month for their
                    supervisor’s services, (see AEIC of Michael Chew Choon Ling at
                    para 18). In this same letter of 29 October 2004, the project
                    consultant expressed his doubts about the Plaintiff’s ability to complete
                    the subcontract and stated that the Defendant was to “replace your
                    current sub-contractor, if necessary”. These complaint letters continue
                    through to January 2005. It is worth noting a letter of 17 January 2005
                    from the project consultant to the Defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I refer to my warning letter no.1 dated 30 Dec 04 to you regarding

                        reserves the right to engage a third party to carry out the work and all
                        costs incurred will be recovered from you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is significant to note that in the
                    Defendant’s AEIC submitted at the arbitration, Ong Kai Siong’s AEIC
                    at para15 states that after the project consultant’s warning letter of
                    30 December 2004, the Defendant took over the extended covered walkways at
                    Blocks 702, 607 and 413A because the Plaintiff had not started any work on these
                    items. The Defendant informed the Plaintiff of this by a letter dated
                    30 December 2004 and in that same letter, gave notice that they would
                    ‘back charge’ the costs against the Plaintiff. These 3 blocks were
                    in Part A of the contract works. From the tables at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, the contract sums for the work at these 3 blocks
                    totalled $103,000 (Block 702 - $39,000; Block 607 - $23,000; and Block 413A -
                    $41,000). Taking away the 5% profit and attendance, the subcontract sums for
                    these 3 Blocks taken over before any work was carried out by the Plaintiff
                    amounted to $97,850. As of 10 January 2005, the only sums being withheld
                    were under Payment Certificates No. 2 and 3, <em>ie</em> $58,065, (Payment Certificate No. 4 having been issued
                    only on 10 January 2005). On top of the facts recited above, the Arbitrator
                    found that the Plaintiff wrongfully abandoned the subcontract works on
                    10 January 2005. It follows that the Defendant had to take over and
                    complete the works and was probably not going to be able to complete on time,
                    exposing themselves to a claim for delay damages from the Town
                Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It may not be usual for the Court to dredge
                    out such detailed facts on an application for leave to appeal, but I do so for a
                    number of reasons. First the Arbitrator certainly had the evidence to come to
                    the conclusions that he did. Secondly, and more relevantly, the questions of law
                    do not arise in a vacuum. The Defendant here had more than ample ground to know,
                    for sure, at the time it withheld Payment Certificates No. 2 and 3, that
                    the damages it was likely to suffer was considerable, had accrued and there was
                    every prospect of even more loss and damage materialising in the future. As
                    noted above, of a subcontract sum of $543,400, the subcontractor had not
                    completed, by value, $419,092.50 or some 77% of its subcontract works. Some
                    4½ months of a 6 month contract had passed. The Arbitrator found and held
                    that the Defendant’s cost and expense incurred to complete the Project was
                    $768,290.51. Against this is a total sum of $109,575.37, but only $58,065 as of
                    10 January 2005, withheld. It is in this context that I now turn to the
                    Award once more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The main question of law raised before me was
                    not overlooked but was in fact an issue argued before the Arbitrator:
                    “The Claimants averred that the set-off amounts must first be ascertained
                    before the Respondents were entitled to set-off” (see the Award at [40]).
                    The Arbitrator construed clauses 10d and 11 of the subcontract, applied the
                    facts and noted at [31] of the Award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Defendant] had paid the [Plaintiff] $20,947.50 under Certificate No.1
                        but had withheld payment under Certificate No. 2 to set-off against
                        damages for delays caused to the Subcontract works by the [Plaintiff]. The
                        [Defendant] argued that due to delays by the [Plaintiff], the [Defendant]
                        had taken over some of the works and it was prudent and reasonable for them,
                        to assess any potential set-off they would have against the [Plaintiff]
                        before making further payment to them. Their right to set-off had been
                        expressly provided for under clause 10d of the Subcontract
                        conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and held at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Defendant] <em>had withheld payment</em> of the
                        amounts due in respect of Certificate Nos. 2 &amp; 3 <em>because they were of the view that it was the [Plaintiff] who [was] in
                            breach</em> of the Subcontract by failing to proceed with the
                        works diligently and with due expedition and had delayed the progress of the
                        works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although cited for a different proposition, Woo JC’s
                    decision in <em>AL Stainless Steel Industries</em> was
                    cited to the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Arbitrator found and held that the
                    Defendant had to deploy its own resources to assist the Plaintiff catch up with
                    the subcontract works and were entitled to withhold payments “to set-off
                    against the loss and damage suffered by the [Defendant] as a result of the
                    [Plaintiff’s] breach” (at [50] of the Award). Further, at [51] he
                    stated “I am convinced that there was sufficient evidence adduced by the
                    [Defendant] that the [s]ubcontract works were in culpable delay and that the
                    same was attributable to the [Plaintiff], since the entire [s]ubcontract works
                    had been subcontracted to them.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the evidence before the Arbitrator and his
                    findings in his Award, can it be said that the Defendant had not estimated any
                    sum or had an ‘unquantified’ amount when he exercised his set-off
                    and was therefore not entitled to do so? I think not. As noted above, the
                    Arbitrator answered this at [42] and [50] of the Award. This is one of those
                    clear cases where the contra claims were self-evident and they were likely to be
                    considerably in excess of the Plaintiff’s claims. The Defendant clearly
                    was entitled to his contra claims for the subcontractor’s breaches and he
                    was certainly justified in withholding payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Leave Should be Given</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Even if I am wrong, the subcontract here was a
                    one off contract, being the Plaintiff’s own contract form and not a
                    standard form. It comprised a letter of 3 paragraphs, a 2-page agreement form, a
                    2-page appendix and a 4-page Terms and Conditions containing 18 clauses,
                    including grammatical, syntax and other errors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Jeyaretnam SC sought to persuade me
                    that the wording of clause 11 was similar to other standard form contracts. He
                    referred me to clause 52 of the Singapore Contractors’ Association
                    Ltd’s (“SCAL’s”) Conditions of Sub-contract for
                    Domestic Sub-contracts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding anything in the Sub-contract, the Contractor shall be
                        entitled to deduct from or set off against any money due from the Contractor
                        to the Sub-contractor under the Sub-Contract any sum which the
                        Sub-Contractor is or may be liable to pay to the Contractor under the
                        Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and clause 11.4 of the Singapore Institute of Architects
                    (“SIA”) Conditions of Sub-contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Contractor may set-off against any monies due to the Sub-Contractor
                        under the Sub-Contract, such loss or damage suffered or incurred by him as a
                        result of the failure of the Sub-Contractor to carry out the Sub-Contract
                        Works with diligence or due expedition or to complete the Sub-Contract Works
                        by the date or dates specified in Schedule III hereto or the date or dates
                        as extended until such date as may be certified by the Contractor in his
                        Sub-Contract Completion Certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Neither of the clauses are sufficiently similar to the conditions here
                    to support his submission. This is especially true because these clauses were
                    within different standard form contracts with their own structure. For example
                    under the SIA Conditions of Sub-contract, there is an elaborate clause 11.5
                    which prescribes conditions precedent for the main contractor to exercise its
                    rights of set off, this includes quantifying the set-off in detail with
                    particulars and reasonable accuracy, giving written notice of the same and
                    grounds upon which the set-off is made. These are absent in the subcontract
                    before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In this subcontract, clause 5 provides that
                    the Plaintiff subcontractor will indemnify the Defendant main contractor from
                    and against, <em>inter alia</em>, any breach,
                    non-observance or non-performance of the provisions of the main contract by the
                    subcontractor, its servants or agents or any act of omission by the
                    subcontractor, its servants or agents, which will involve the main contractor in
                    any liability to the Town Council. I accept the terms and conditions of the main
                    contract did not feature in this dispute, but the latter indemnity will still
                    apply to the facts here. The SCAL’s Conditions of Sub-contract for
                    Domestic Sub-contracts may or may not have had an indemnity clause as I was not
                    shown the full subcontract conditions. The SIA Conditions of Sub-contract has
                    rather more elaborate indemnities under Condition 4.2 and Condition 9 than
                    clause 5 in the current subcontract before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Jeyaretnam SC then tried to persuade
                    me that set-offs arise all the time and are common in the building and
                    construction industry, a subcontractor needs to know under what circumstances a
                    main contractor’s breach of payment terms can be justified and in
                    particular whether ascertainment of an amount due from a subcontractor to a main
                    contractor is required and whether he can actually set-off against amounts owing
                    to the subcontractor without ascertaining or quantifying the sums; there needs
                    to be certainty in the industry.</p>

                        itself, without the benefit of argument, that the arbitrator was obviously
                        wrong; and</p>

                        mbH &amp; Co &amp; Others</em> [2003] 1 WLR 1015,
                        (“<em>The Northern Pioneer</em>”), a case
                    involving construction of the war cancellation clause in the NYPE time charter
                    form, and the onset of NATO operations in Kosovo in March 1999, the English
                    Court of Appeal, at [60], said that section 69(3)(c)(ii) of the 1996 Arbitration
                    Act, (our equivalent being section 49(5)(c)(ii)), imposed a broader requirement
                    than Lord Diplock’s formulation in <em>The Nema</em>
                    that leave should not be given “unless the judge considered that a strong
                    prima facie case had been made out that the arbitrator had been wrong in his
                    construction.” According to Lord Phillips MR, Lord Diplock’s
                    formulation “was calculated to place a particularly severe restraint on
                    the role of the commercial and higher courts in resolving issues of commercial
                    law of general public importance.” This has now been superceded by the
                    statutory criteria in section 69(3)(c)(ii), which opens the door “a
                    little more widely to the granting of permission to appeal than the crack that
                    was left open by Lord Diplock.” (see judgment at [11] and [61]). So
                    except for the fact that the arbitrators there had decided that the charterers
                    had failed to exercise their right to cancel within a reasonable time, which
                    rendered the other issues academic, the court could have granted leave as the
                    construction of the standard NYPE form’s war cancellation clause and their
                    manner of application in the light of the changing circumstances of
                    international conflict was of general public importance and would substantially
                    affect the rights of one or the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The first question of law is in effect, the
                    construction of the subcontract clauses and the right of repudiation. It is a
                    ‘one-off’ contract and it is related to the particular facts of this
                    case. It clearly does not satisfy either <em>The Nema</em>
                    principles nor section 49 of the Arbitration Act as interpreted by <em>The Northern Pioneer</em>. I note Mr Jeyaretnam SC did
                    not, and quite rightly in my respectful view, spend any time on
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The second question of law suffers from the
                    same defect, it is a one-off contract and it was decided on its own particular
                    facts. Despite the absence of any findings of fact in relation to the question
                    of <em>bona fides</em> or reasonableness, referred to at
                        <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above, I cannot say that the
                    Arbitrator here is “obviously wrong” in this case. On the
                    contrary, the Arbitrator’s findings are amply supported by the evidence
                    before him and he was certainly justified in coming to the decision that he did.
                    The determination of this question of law will not therefore substantially
                    affect the rights of one or more of the parties. Neither can it be said on the
                    basis of his findings of fact in the Award, that the decision of the Arbitrator
                    is obviously wrong, nor, even if I accept that the question is one of general
                    importance, that the Arbitrator’s decision is open to serious
                    doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It follows that the application for leave to
                    appeal on the two questions of law must be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Costs must follow the event and unless there
                    are any special circumstances that I am unaware of, and if so, the parties are
                    at liberty to write in for a hearing thereon within 10 days from the date
                    hereof, I award costs to the Defendant which are to be agreed or taxed. If
                    neither party writes in within the stipulated time, my award on costs shall
                    become final.</p>
