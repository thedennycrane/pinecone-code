There is also an accompanying application to set aside the leave that has been granted to enforce the arbitral award.  The thrust of the application is that the arbitrator failed to determine issues that were in dispute, that he ignored certain submissions and that he had conducted himself in a manner which showed an apparent bias on his part.  As a result, it is alleged that the claimant in the arbitration was deprived of the award of damages in several material respects.

</div>
</div>  This will be explained in greater detail later in my judgment.  Also, I should mention that no issue is taken by the respondent that the application was made within the time period prescribed by statute.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 7 September 2018, the respondent filed Originating Summons 1108 of 2018 (“OS 1108/2018”) for leave to enforce the arbitral award.  This was an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application which was granted by the court on 10 October 2018.  The applicant then filed, on 25 October 2018, SUM 5038 of 2018 (“SUM 5038/2018”), seeking to set aside the order of court granting the respondent leave to enforce the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 This judgment is in respect of OS 1010/2018 and SUM 5038/2018.  Both applications are the applicant’s efforts to prevent the enforcement of the arbitral award, and were heard by me at the same time.  The grounds relied upon by the applicant in both these applications are the same.  These grounds are elaborated on later in my judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 For completeness, I should also add that the applicant has also filed, on 14 June 2018, an application for leave to appeal against the award on certain questions of law.  This was via Originating Summons 730 of 2018 (“OS 730/2018”).  That was heard together with this matter but immediately after the arguments were made in  OS 1010/2018 and SUM 5038/2018.  In the course of the hearing, counsel for the respondent had asked whether I would be issuing a single judgment in respect of both matters.  As the issues raised in OS 730/2018 differ from those raised with respect to OS 1010/2018 and SUM 5038/2018, I decided eventually to issue a separate judgment in respect of OS 730/2018.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In its application in OS 1010/2018, the applicant has sought a prayer for the arbitral award to be set aside in its entirety.  However, in the applicant’s submissions, it was clarified that she is not seeking to set aside the parts of the award that deal with (i) the arbitrator’s determination on the claim of discrepancies between the completed works and the construction drawings (see [16(a)] above), and (ii) the arbitrator’s determination on the respondent’s counterclaim (see [16(f)] above).

</div>  Apart from those parts, she submits that the rest of the award should be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The grounds of the applicant application are elaborated on in her affidavit filed in support.  In summary, she asserts that the arbitrator had failed to decide certain issues that had been submitted to him for his determination.  She also alleges that there were various breaches of natural justice by the arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 First, the arbitrator had allegedly failed to consider whether the applicant was entitled to general damages for the delay in the completion of the works.  He had not decided whether the respondent was entitled to an extension of time to complete the works or what was otherwise a reasonable period for completion.  As a consequence, the arbitrator had failed to decide matters which had been submitted to him for his decision.  The applicant had suffered prejudice because she was deprived of an award of general damages for the delay in completion of the contractual works.

These had been made prior to the arbitration hearing.  As a consequence, there was a breach of natural justice that affected the arbitrator’s findings on the validity of the delay certificates.

More particularly, it was alleged that the arbitrator had demonstrated apparent bias during the cross-examination of the applicant’s expert on property valuation, Mr Goh Tiam Lock (“Mr Goh”).  The arbitrator had also relied on his own knowledge and experience with regard to the issue of valuation of the property.  Further, the arbitrator had subjected Mr Goh to excessive and unwarranted interruptions when he was giving his evidence.  According to the applicant, all this showed that the arbitrator had already made up his mind about the issue of the loss in value of the property.

</div>  The applicant thus suffered prejudice because she was deprived of an award of damages for the loss in value of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, it is argued that the arbitrator had failed to consider the evidence that had been given by the applicant’s building surveyor expert, Mr Chin Cheong (“Mr Chin”).  Instead, the arbitrator had relied on the views of the architect, Mr Liu, on whether certain complaints were in fact defects in the works.  In this vein, it is also argued that the arbitrator also exhibited apparent bias in the manner in which he treated the evidence given by Mr Chin on the issue of the defects in the works.  The applicant suffered prejudice because she was not awarded the amounts that she sought as the damages for the defects.

Did the arbitrator rely on his own knowledge and experience in substitution for the views of Mr Goh?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On the question of the claim for damages for rectification works for the defects - did the arbitrator exhibit apparent bias in his rejection of the evidence of Mr Chin on the claim for damages for defects and his preference for the evidence of the architect?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On the question of the quantification of damages for rectification works for the defects - did the arbitrator exhibit apparent bias in his rejection of Mr Teo’s evidence?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 There are various sub-issues within these broad issues that I will have to deal with as well.  These relate to the specific allegations as to the arbitrator’s conduct on the question of his apparent bias, his alleged reliance on matters not raised to the parties for their submissions and also his alleged non-consideration of certain discrete issues on the question of general damages for delay.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">legal</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I first start with a review of the applicable legal principles that govern the applicant’s application, brought under s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(vii) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48.—(1) An award may be set aside by the Court —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) if the party who applies to the Court to set aside the award proves to the satisfaction of the Court that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vii) a <span class="font-italic">breach of the rules of natural justice</span> occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been <span class="font-italic">prejudiced</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Essentially, a challenge made under s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(vii) of the Act is one that is made on grounds of breach of natural justice.  There are two pillars of natural justice.  First, the arbitrator must be disinterested and unbiased.  Second, the parties must be given adequate notice and opportunity to be heard; sub-branches of this second principle are that each party must be given a fair hearing and a fair opportunity to present its case (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>”) at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Gas &amp; Fuel Corporation of Victoria v Wood Hall Ltd &amp; Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd </span>[1978] VR 385 at 396 with approval).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In this case, the applicant alleges that both pillars of natural justice have been breached by the arbitrator and that these breaches have caused the applicant prejudice, such that the award ought to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adequate notice and opportunity to be heard</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 First, as regards the issues of whether the applicant is entitled to general, instead of liquidated, damages and whether the arbitrator had failed to consider the 8 January 2016 submissions, the query arises as to whether the applicant had been given a fair hearing and a fair opportunity to present her case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The applicable principles in relation to this second pillar of natural justice were extensively canvassed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [65], following a comprehensive review of the authorities in this respect.  In summary, the Court of Appeal observed that parties to arbitration have a general right to be heard on <span class="font-italic">every issue </span>that may be relevant to the resolution of a dispute.  Arbitrators in this regard ought to allow all parties reasonable opportunities to present their cases as well as to respond, and an arbitrator ought not to base his decision(s) on matters not submitted or argued before him (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [65(a)]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, to ensure the integrity of the arbitral process, courts have adopted a policy of minimal curial intervention.  In the context of applications to set aside an arbitral award, in so far as the right to be heard is concerned, the failure of the arbitrator to refer every point for decision to the parties for submissions is not invariably a valid ground for challenge (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [65(c)] and [65(d)]).  Instead, the overriding burden is on the applicant seeking to set aside the award to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award.  Certain examples of what would amount to such an instance were provided in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [65(d)]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Only in instances such as where the impugned decision reveals a <span class="font-italic">dramatic departure </span>from the submissions, or involves an arbitrator receiving <span class="font-italic">extraneous evidence</span>, or adopts a view <span class="font-italic">wholly at odds with the established evidence</span> adduced by the parties, or arrives at a <span class="font-italic">conclusion unequivocally rejected by the parties as being trivial or irrelevant</span>, might it be appropriate for a court to intervene. In short, there must be a real basis for alleging that the arbitrator has conducted the arbitral process either <span class="font-italic">irrationally or capriciously</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this respect, the court also recognised that it is “almost invariably the case that parties propose diametrically opposite solutions to resolve a dispute.”  Nonetheless, the arbitrator is not bound to adopt either of the approaches proposed by the parties, and “[h]e is perfectly entitled to embrace a middle path (even without apprising the parties of his provisional thinking or analysis) so long as it is based on evidence that is before him”.  In short, the arbitrator is not expected to inexorably adopt the parties’ submissions or to consult parties on his thinking and reasoning process, “unless [his award] involves a dramatic departure from what has been presented to him” (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [65(e)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Finally, “it is not the function of the court to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically in attempting to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral process; rather, an award should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately remedied” (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [65(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, the applicant also alleges that the arbitrator had been biased against her experts, namely Mr Goh, Mr Chin and Mr Teo.  This amounts to an allegation that there has been a breach of the first pillar of natural justice, which requires the arbitrator to be disinterested and unbiased: <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [43].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 To establish the existence of apparent bias, which could warrant the setting aside of the award, the test is whether “there are circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that the tribunal was biased” (<span class="font-italic">Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 at [91]).  This has been described as the “reasonable suspicion test”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In this regard, parties “are entitled to expect from an arbitrator <span class="font-italic">complete impartiality and indifference</span>” and “an arbitrator must always act judicially with a <span class="font-italic">detached mind </span>and patience.  <span class="font-italic">He </span><span class="font-italic">must not at any time descend into the arena</span> or take an adversarial role.  <span class="font-italic">His response and words used must always be measured and circumspect</span>” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Kempinski Hotels SA v PT Prima International Development</span> [2011] 4 SLR 633 at [67], citing <span class="font-italic">Turner (East Asia) Pte Ltd v Builders Federal (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[1988] 1 SLR(R) 483 at [65] and [78]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Need for actual or real prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As a final point, aside from alleging a breach of the rules of natural justice, the applicant must also show how such a breach of natural justice has prejudiced the rights of the applicant who seeks to set aside the arbitral award: s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(vii) of the Act and <span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd (formerly known as John Holland Construction &amp; Engineering Pty Ltd)  v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan)</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 443 (“<span class="font-italic">John Holland</span>”) at [18].  The prejudice in this regard must be “some actual or real prejudice”.  While this is “a lower hurdle than substantial prejudice, it certainly does not embrace technical or procedural irregularities that have caused no harm in the final analysis.”  This means that “the breach of the rules of natural justice must, at the very least, have actually <span class="font-italic">altered the final outcome of the arbitral proceedings </span>in some meaningful way” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 With these principles in mind, I proceed now to consider the issues before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the arbitrator fail to decide the issue of whether the applicant is entitled to general damages for delay?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The applicant submits that there is no dispute between the parties that the date when the works were actually completed was 19 January 2011.

</div> there is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> a delay of almost seven months by the respondent in the completion of works.  While the applicant might not have succeeded in her claim for liquidated damages due to the arbitrator’s finding that the second delay certificate was invalid, the arbitrator should have gone on to determine whether there should be an extension of time granted to the respondent for the completion of the works.  However, the arbitrator failed to analyse this issue and rule on it.  By failing to determine whether the respondent was entitled to an extension of time, the arbitrator thereby failed to consider if the applicant ought to be entitled to general damages flowing from the respondent’s delay in the completion of the works.  This, it was alleged, constituted a breach of natural justice.

In those further submissions, there was a clear shift in the applicant’s arguments on the type of general damages she had claimed in the arbitration.  It was argued in these further submissions that the applicant had claimed general damages in terms of the loss of rental for the delay in completion of the works and there was evidence of such loss of rental.

</div>  These contentions must be placed in their proper context.  In response to the applicant’s claim for liquidated damages based on the second delay certificate, the respondent had pleaded and raised issues such as prevention on the part of the applicant.

</div>
</div>  This was a defence to the claim for delay.  If time had been set at large because of the acts of prevention on the part of the applicant, then the claim for liquidated damages might be defeated because the respondent might be granted an extension of time to complete the works.  However, the arbitrator eventually did not have to decide this issue of whether there were acts of prevention, whether time was set at large and what was a reasonable extension of time for the respondent to complete its works.  This is because the applicant failed to prove that it was entitled to liquidated damages for the delayed completion given the invalidity of the delay certificates.  As such, in the award, while these issues were mentioned by the arbitrator as having been raised, a proper analysis of his reasoning shows that the arbitrator was simply setting out the various arguments and contentions raised by the parties.

His reasoning was actually quite straightforward.  First, he relied on Mr Liu’s own evidence that the first delay certificate, which stipulated that the works had gone into delay from 23 November 2010, thus effectively granting the respondent an extension of time of up to 22 November 2010 to complete the contract works, was flawed.  This was because, amongst other reasons, the date of 23 November 2010 had been arbitrarily arrived at.

</div>  Given the bases of his findings and decision, it was not necessary for the arbitrator to expressly deal with the rest of the applicant’s arguments made in the 8 January 2016 submissions concerning the delay certificates.  For example, it was not necessary for the arbitrator to deal with the argument made by the applicant that clause 23(3) of the SIA Conditions permitted the architect to delay his decision on whether to grant an extension of time until he is in receipt of sufficient information, which it was said was the reason why the architect waited until 2015 to decide on a ten business days extension in the second delay certificate.

</div>  I see nothing wrong in what the arbitrator did.  What is relevant is that the arbitrator allowed Mr Goh to give his answers fully, including an explanation of the factors that would be relevant to the market value of the property.  He also allowed the applicant’s counsel at the arbitration to further re-examine Mr Goh on these points as well.  I do not accept the submission that the arbitrator, through his questions of Mr Goh, entered into the fray and displayed an apparent bias with regard to the evidence of Mr Goh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Quite apart from this, I find that there is no basis for the submission that the arbitrator had interrupted Mr Goh’s answers during his oral evidence with the aim of trying to steer Mr Goh’s evidence in a particular direction.  The questions posed were open-ended in nature, and Mr Goh was not prevented from elaborating on his answers given to the arbitrator’s questions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The arbitrator’s alleged reliance on his own knowledge and experience  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Next, the applicant submits that the arbitrator had preferred his own knowledge and experience over that of the expert, Mr Goh.  There are two aspects to the applicant’s complaint in this regard.  First, the applicant submits that, from the questions raised by the arbitrator to Mr Goh, it was clear that the arbitrator preferred his own knowledge and experience over the evidence given by Mr Goh.  It was contended that the arbitrator should not have done this because he was not qualified to do so.

As I have explained earlier, the arbitrator simply raised his concerns to Mr Goh during his oral evidence about the factors that might be relevant to a determination of the market value of the property.  From my review of the award, the arbitrator decided not to place any reliance on the valuation of Mr Goh because of his assessment of the quality of his expert evidence.  He found that Mr Goh could not substantiate why his valuation of the property was significantly higher than the other transactions concluded around the same time in the vicinity of the property, as shown by the records of property transactions maintained by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

</div>  In short, the arbitrator’s decision to reject Mr Goh’s evidence was entirely proper, and the applicant was not able to point to me any part of the award which showed that the arbitrator took into account his own knowledge or experience as a reason for his rejection of Mr Goh’s valuation of the property.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reliance on a “well-known fact”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The other aspect of the applicant’s complaint is as to the arbitrator’s alleged reliance on “a well-known fact” that leaving defects in a building unrepaired would cause the defects to deteriorate.  This was in the context of the issue of whether the applicant had mitigated her losses that arose from the defects in the property.  What the applicant had done was to leave the defects in the building as they were in order to preserve the evidence of the defects.

By not doing so, the applicant was deprived of an opportunity to show that the arbitrator’s reliance on the “well-known fact” was misplaced.

An arbitrator, like a judge, is entitled to rely on his own common sense when analysing and determining the issues in the case.  It is plainly common sense that defects in a building which are left un-remedied, like the water seepage in this case, would just deteriorate over time and cause further damage to the building.  The arbitrator cannot be expected to refer such obvious points to the parties to ask them whether they agree with it: see <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [65(e)].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 However, quite apart from this, as counsel for the respondent pointed out at the hearing before me, there was evidence given by the respondent’s building surveyor expert, Ms Catherine Loke (“Ms Loke”), also an architect by profession, on how defects would deteriorate over time if they are not promptly rectified.

</div>  In other words, it had not been shown that the property was even valued at S$7m, such that there had been a “loss in value”.  Further, even if the property was indeed valued at S$7m, it had not been proven that the subsequent loss in value of the property was caused by the defects in the property.  Given the arbitrator’s finding that the applicant had not proven the causative link between the defects in the property and her inability to sell the property at her expected price of S$7m between October 2012 and April 2013, it is clear that the arbitrator’s reference to the “well-known fact” when dealing with the issue of mitigation had no impact on the applicant’s claim for loss in value of the property due to the defects.  Strictly speaking, any finding by the arbitrator on the point of mitigation, whether with reference to the “well-known fact” or otherwise, was irrelevant given the findings on causation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I should also point out that counsel for the applicant agreed in the hearing before me that, on the face of the award, the issue of causation of the loss in value of the property was not linked to the arbitrator’s observation about the “well-known fact” that un-remedied defects would deteriorate over time in Singapore’s climate.

He confirmed that he was not instructed to review the correspondence between the parties, or other documents and drawings to determine what parties had actually agreed.

</div>  As a result, Mr Chin was unaware of why certain items of work were carried out in a certain way, which might have contributed to his conclusion that the items in question were defects.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 During the course of Mr Chin’s evidence, and after it was completed, the arbitrator expressed his concerns to the parties’ counsel that it was difficult to determine based on Mr Chin’s evidence whether a complaint was really a defect or a result of the architect’s design or an agreed variation.  The arbitrator informed both counsel that his view was that the architect’s evidence would be relevant in determining whether each complaint can really be characterised as a defect that was attributable to the respondent in that they did not comply with the terms of the contract, as varied or otherwise.

In the first place, this is not a complaint that can be raised by the applicant given that any bias, if any, would be in her favour.  Secondly, the applicant had already called the architect as a witness in the proceedings before this issue of his knowledge of the defects was raised during the course of Mr Chin’s oral evidence.  Thirdly, it is preposterous to suggest, without any evidence, that a professional man would not testify truthfully and honestly just because he had been appointed by a party and paid by that party.  If the applicant is right, such a criticism would apply to Mr Chin as well.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The applicant also points out that the architect’s final inspection of the property was on 22 February 2012 to check if the defects listed in the “defects list” dated 19 December 2011 had been rectified.  As such, the defects that manifested after 19 December 2011 would not have been examined by the architect in person.  He would have only seen these defects from the photos in Mr Chin’s report.

In the award, the arbitrator explained why he found Mr Chin’s evidence to be less reliable than the architect’s evidence.

</div>  This was a plainly untenable submission to make.  As pointed out by the respondent’s counsel, the arbitrator did not accept the entirety of the architect’s evidence.  For example, he did not completely accept the architect’s evidence that the rotten timber battens were as a result of defective work, but instead found that the architect’s design flaw in not having sufficient rainwater outlet pipes had contributed to the rotting of the timber battens.  However, the arbitrator also found that the respondent had failed to properly treat the timber battens.  In the result, he found that the respondent was only liable for 50% of the costs of rectification.

</div> the respondent had provided concrete examples to show why Mr Teo’s evidence was unreliable.  For example, the arbitrator had considered that Mr Teo had included the cost of the provision of scaffolding for a single item of defect even though he had already provided a separate amount for scaffolding under “Preliminaries”.  According to the arbitrator, this separate provision for scaffolding was not logical, unless Mr Teo was suggesting that for “ten such areas of defects, the [applicant] is going to appoint ten different contractors … and each individual contractor must install its own scaffold” to make good the defects.

Mr Teo had arrived at this figure solely based on a quotation of S$12,000 by another contractor.  In contrast, Mr Wong provided that the cost of rectification of the railing would only be S$2,270.64.  The reason for the significant difference in the pricing was because Mr Teo’s quotation was for <span class="font-italic">laminated</span>, rather than ordinary<span class="font-italic"> </span>tampered glass.

His rejection of Mr Teo’s assessment was by no means cursory given that, in many cases, the arbitrator had set out the submissions made by both parties before coming to a decision as to whose views were to be preferred.

As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 1 SLR 733 (“<span class="font-italic">SEF</span>”) at [60], “[n]atural justice requires that the parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions made.”  In <span class="font-italic">SEF</span>, the adjudicator had failed to discuss his reasoning and explicitly state his conclusions in relation to the third and fourth jurisdictional issues.  Prakash J found that given that the adjudicator had taken pains to explain the reasons for his other determinations, and even indicated matters on which he was not making a determination, it may have been an accidental omission on his part, and whatever may be the reason for the adjudicator’s omission, she did not think that the applicant was not afforded natural justice as a result.  Here, the arbitrator had provided clear, albeit sometimes brief, reasons for preferring Mr Wong’s evidence.  These reasons were objective, and did not evince a blatant and unwarranted preference for Mr Wong.  In the circumstances, it cannot be argued that he failed to consider Mr Teo’s evidence, or that a reasonable suspicion is raised in relation to the arbitrator’s bias.  Therefore, I reject the applicant’s assertion that the arbitrator had exhibited apparent bias against Mr Teo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arbitrator’s mistake </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The applicant also points out that, in one instance, the arbitrator had mistakenly read Mr Teo’s assessed costs of rectification as being a far larger figure.  This was for the attic bathroom and the master bedroom steam room.  Mr Teo had indicated the costs of rectification of the defects to be $1,111 and $973 respectively.  He then provided an “optional” assessment based on a “full replacement cost”, which he found to be $19,721 and $13,225 respectively.

</div>  The result of the arbitrator accepting Mr Wong’s assessed figures was that <span class="font-italic">more </span>damages were allowed to the applicant for this item than should have been the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As a preliminary point, it is unclear what rule of natural justice this mistake encroached upon, since it neither shows that the arbitrator failed to consider the applicant’s submissions, nor does it <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>show that the arbitrator was biased against Mr Teo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The more fundamental point, however, is that while the arbitrator clearly made a mistake in this regard, it is clear that no real prejudice was suffered by the applicant which would justify a setting aside of the award.  Quite the contrary, the applicant fortuitously received <span class="font-italic">more </span>damages as a consequence of the arbitrator’s mistake.  Hence, this is clearly not a basis for setting aside the award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In this judgment, I have sought to consider every allegation of a breach of natural justice that was raised by the applicant.  In certain instances, the prejudice suffered by the applicant was patently absent, while in other instances, allegations of bias were simply unfounded.  The issue of general damages was also raised for the first time before me, when the issue was clearly not before the arbitrator during the arbitration proceedings.  In the circumstances, I am inclined to agree with the respondent’s counsel that the various allegations of breaches of the rules of natural justice is but a disguised attempt to challenge the merits of the award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 It bears reminding parties that arbitration is often selected by parties as an <span class="font-italic">efficient </span>means to dispose of the dispute before them.  This is the fundamental reason minimal curial intervention is warranted, as backdoor attempts to challenge the merits of an arbitrator’s decision conflict with the policy of facilitating the prompt resolution of disputes.  I stress that, when a breach of natural justice is alleged, courts <span class="font-italic">do not </span>evaluate the merits of the arbitrator’s decision, and the award is only set aside if four elements can be shown: first, which rule of natural justice was breached; second, how it was breached; third, in what way was the breach connected with the making of the award; and fourth, how the breach had caused real prejudice to the rights of the party concerned: <span class="font-italic">John Holland </span>at [18].  Before filing a setting aside application, parties who may be dissatisfied with an arbitral award ought to carefully consider whether all four of the above elements have been met, or whether any other grounds for setting aside are reasonably available.  Submissions on breaches of the rules of natural justice ought to be structured in accordance with the four elements above, so that it will be clear to the court how the alleged breach arose, and how it caused prejudice to the applicant.  Needless to say, only meritorious applications to set aside an award will be looked upon favourably, and frivolous applications may be met with adverse cost consequences if the circumstances call for such orders.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the applicant’s applications in OS 1010/2018 and SUM 5038/2018 entirely.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I will hear parties separately on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Choon Guan Daniel, Lim Khoon and Ang Minghao (Eldan Law LLP) for the applicant in HC/OS 1010/2018 and the defendant in HC/OS 1108/2018;<br/>Por Hock Sing Michael and Li Jiaxin (Michael Por Law Corporation) for the respondent in HC/OS 1010/2018 and the plaintiff in HC/OS 1108/2018.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
