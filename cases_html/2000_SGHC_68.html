<p align="justify">THE STATEMENT OF FACTS</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The joint Statement of Facts admitted by the two Accused persons

reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1 The Accused persons are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">b. Zhou Jian Guang @ Guo Ping, (hereinafter "1<sup>st</sup>

    Accused"), male / 26 years. He is a national of the People’s Republic of China. </p>
<p align="justify">c. Shi Song Jing @ Ah Jing, (hereinafter "2<sup>nd</sup>

    Accused") male / 29 years. He is a national of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2 The victim is Yong Sze Hui (hereinafter "the victim")

  female / 14 years, a Secondary 2 student of Monk’s Hill Secondary School. She is

  residing at No. 25 Sian Tuan Avenue, Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">3 Investigations revealed that sometime in early August 1999, one

  Vincent Lee Chuan Leong (hereinafter "Vincent Lee") met the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Accused at a coffeeshop located behind Hougang Plaza. Both 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Accused asked Vincent Lee whether he could help them find a job in Singapore. A few days

  later, they met up again at a hawker centre in Hougang. There, Vincent Lee suggested that

  they conduct a kidnap for ransom and came up with the details to execute the scheme. Both

  1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused agreed to the plan suggested by Vincent Lee.</p>
<p align="justify">4 On 25 August 1999, Vincent Lee rented a house at No. 43 Lorong Kismis

  through a housing agent from Mr K Sivanathan. He paid for the rental of the house by way

  of a United Overseas Bank ("UOB") cheque amounting to $2,600. Vincent Lee also

  paid the housing agent, Mr Tham See Weng, $325 as commission by way of another UOB cheque.

  The purpose of renting this house was to keep the victim there for the duration of the

  kidnapping. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">5 On 26 August 1999, Vincent Lee proceeded to M/s National Automobile

  Service at Block 5033 Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2 #01-279. There, he rented a Toyota

  LiteAce Motor van, bearing registration number GQ 3466 Y (hereinafter "the

  vehicle"). He paid for the rental of the vehicle using his Overseas Chinese Banking

  Corporation Visa credit card.</p>
<p align="justify">6 On the same day, Vincent Lee went to a shop in Ubi Industrial Estate.

  There, he paid for a pair of false vehicle licence plates bearing number GQ 6292. Later

  that day, Vincent Lee and 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused fixed the false licence plates on to the

  vehicle. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">7 From 26 August 1999 till 8 September 1999, Vincent Lee, together with

  1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused, drove around Singapore looking for victims to

  kidnap. The profile of their intended target was that of a young schoolgirl. They decided

  to roam the Bukit Timah area as they felt that it was a "rich man’s" area.</p>
<p align="justify">8 On 9 September 1999, the victim was walking alone along Sian Tuan

  Avenue on her way home. Near the junction of Sian Tuan Avenue and Hua Guan Lane, the

  vehicle was driven up to the victim. Vincent Lee was the driver of the vehicle. The 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Accused grabbed the victim and pulled her into the van while 1<sup>st</sup> Accused closed

  the sliding door of the van. As Vincent Lee drove off, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Accused blindfolded the victim and tied her up using adhesive tapes.</p>
<p align="justify">9 Upon arriving at No. 43 Lorong Kismis, the victim was carried into

  one of the bedrooms of the house by 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused. Vincent Lee and both the 1<sup>st</sup>

  and 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused then asked the victim questions pertaining to her family’s

  wealth and background. They also obtained the victim’s father’s handphone and

  residence telephone numbers from her.</p>
<p align="justify">10 Shortly before 9.00 pm on 9 September 1999, the victim’s

  father, Mr Yong Cher Keng, (hereinafter "Mr Yong") received a call on his

  handphone from Vincent Lee who spoke in Mandarin. Vincent Lee informed Mr Yong that the

  victim was in his hands and demanded a sum of $500,000 for the release of the victim if he

  wanted to see the victim again. Vincent Lee then hung up the phone.</p>
<p align="justify">11 About three minutes later, Mr Yong again received another call from

  Vincent Lee on his handphone. This time, Vincent Lee asked him if he had any problem in

  raising the said amount of $500,000. Mr Yong expressed his difficulty in raising the

  money. Vincent Lee then informed Mr Yong that he would call him back about half an hour

  later. Immediately after this call, Mr Yong called ‘999’ and reported the matter

  to the police.</p>
<p align="justify">12 From the time of the police report till the release of the victim

  there were numerous calls made by Vincent Lee to Mr Yong. Mr Yong negotiated with Vincent

  Lee for the ransom to be reduced and it was eventually agreed that the amount would be

  $330,000. During three of the phone calls, Mr Yong was allowed to speak to the victim. One

  of the instructions of Vincent Lee, the victim told Mr Yong that she was safe and that he

  should not alert the Police and that he should get the ransom money ready. Vincent Lee

  also told Mr Yong to put the ransom money in a bag for delivery. Mr Yong replied that he

  had a black bag that he would use for the purpose. </p>
<p align="justify">13 In the evening on 11 September 1999, Vincent Lee gave instructions

  for Mr Yong to drive to Ponggol Marina Park to deliver the ransom money. Mr Yong complied,

  bringing along with him a black bag containing $330,000. Thereafter, Mr Yong was told to

  drive to Blk 127 Tampines St 11 where he was given further instructions on his handphone

  by 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused as to where to drop off the money. The bag containing the money

  was finally dropped off at the grass verge near the overhead bridge. There, the money was

  collected by Vincent Lee and 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused. On the way back, they threw the bag

  out of the car after transferring the money into another carrier. The 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Accused then alighted from the car somewhere at Hougang, taking along with him the ransom

  money as Vincent Lee and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused felt that they were being followed. </p>
<p align="justify">14 The 1<sup>st</sup> Accused remained with the victim in the house at

  No. 43 Lorong Kismis when 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused went with Vincent Lee to collect the

  ransom money. She was blindfolded throughout her stay at No. 43 Lorong Kismis for a period

  of about 60 hours.</p>
<p align="justify">15 On 12 September 1999 at about 7.40 am, the victim was released. She

  managed to take a taxi and return home.</p>
<p align="justify">16 The 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused who had all the ransom money with him

  then went to stay at Blk 311 Hougang Avenue 5. The 1<sup>st</sup> Accused subsequently

  went to join the 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused there. At the flat, the 1<sup>st</sup> Accused

  took out a portion of the ransom money and placed it in his bag. Thereafter, the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Accused left the flat with the bag and went to stay with another Chinese national one

  "Wu Kang". At "Wu Kang"’s flat, he placed his bag containing part

  of the ransom money in a wardrobe. The bag and the money were subsequently stolen by

  another Chinese national, one "Wen Fu" who was staying at the flat.

  Investigations revealed that "Wen Fu" handed a sum of $5,000 to one Lin Shi Jian

  and asked him to have it remitted to China. Lin Shi Jian left the money with Yu Chuan Wen

  for safekeeping. This sum of $5,000 was recovered by the Police from Yu Chuan Wen.</p>
<p align="justify">17 Investigations revealed that 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused disposed of the

  remaining money as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused entrusted a black sports bag containing a

    sum of $134,500 to one Chen Chan Seng for safekeeping. The bag and the money were

    retrieved when the Police arrested Chen Chan Seng;</p>
<p align="justify">b. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused requested Chen Chan Seng to remit another

    sum of $60,000 to his family in China through one Lin Yong Jian. This amount was

    subsequently recovered from the DBS account of Lin Yong Jian who was in the process of

    remitting the money to China. </p>
<p align="justify">c. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Accused also handed a sum of $1500 to one Weng Wu

    Kun in repayment of a loan. However, only a sum of $200 was recovered from Weng Wu Kun as

    the latter had handed a sum of $1000 to his uncle Weng Bao Fa for remission to China, and

    had spent the rest of the money.</p>
<p align="justify">d. The sum of $1400 was recovered from Weng Bao Fa. Investigations

    revealed that $1000 was from Weng Wu Kun and $400 comprised marked notes which formed part

    of the ransom monies taken by "Wen Fu".</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) The Prosecution</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The Prosecution informed me the two Accused persons had no known

criminal history.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 The Prosecution also referred me to the decision of the Court of

Criminal Appeal in <i>Sia Ah Kew &amp; Others v PP</i> <nobr>[1972-1974] SLR 208</nobr> and submitted

that there should be a strong incentive for kidnappers to refrain from harming or

molesting hostages or otherwise behaving cruelly towards them and that caning should be

imposed where there was some harm. The Prosecution conceded that the two Accused persons

here had treated the hostage quite kindly and that she was not molested or hurt.

Accordingly, the Prosecution submitted that caning was not necessary. In addition, the

mastermind, Vincent Lee, was not sentenced to caning as well.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(2) Zhou Jian Guang</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 For Zhou Jian Guang, Mr Sng informed me that he was from a poor

farming family in the province of Fukien, China. He wanted very much to build a new house

for his parents, his wife and a 5-year old son and came to Singapore hoping to achieve

this objective.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 His work at construction sites was irregular but he remitted money

every month back home to repay the loan taken out to finance his passage here. It was when

he was out of work in July 1999 that he and the other Accused happened to meet Vincent Lee

at a coffeeshop where both of them approached him for job openings. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 Sometime in August 1999, Vincent Lee hatched the kidnapping scheme

originally targetted at another girl as hostage. Both Accused persons decided to go along

with Vincent Lee’s plans as he had been providing them with food, cigarettes and

loans. Vincent Lee was also potraying himself as someone not to be disobeyed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 I was urged to take into consideration the following mitigation

factors:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) The plea of guilt;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) His previous clean record;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) The absence of physical injury and ill-treatment on the victim and

  the fact that her welfare was looked after;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) The absence of threats by this Accused;</p>
<p align="justify">(5) His removal of the tapes used to tie the victim’s hands and

  his subsequent release of the victim on his own volition;</p>
<p align="justify">(6) The absence of any weapons;</p>
<p align="justify">(7) The fact that Vincent Lee devised the whole scheme;</p>
<p align="justify">(8) The fact that this Accused had used only $150 to $200 at the end of

  the day; </p>
<p align="justify">(9) The need for consistency in sentencing all the co-Accused persons

  in this matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) Shi Song Jing</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 This Accused came here from China in February 1997 lured by promises

of abundant well-paid jobs in the construction industry only to be abandoned by the agent

once he arrived. He had to fend for himself for the first six months until he found a job

as a plasterer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 As an overstayer, he had reluctantly agreed to participate in the

scheme because of the overbearing Vincent Lee and also because the mastermind provided

free meals and cigarettes.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 I was urged to bear in mind the following factors:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) He pleaded guilty;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) He was completely remorseful and wished to apologise to the victim

  and her family;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) He had no previous criminal record;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) He did not profit from the crime and had assisted the police in

  recovering the loot;</p>
<p align="justify">(5) The victim was unharmed, was actually consoled and cheered by him

  constantly and she was allowed to talk to her father three times over the telephone;</p>
<p align="justify">(6) He removed the adhesive tape from the victim’s mouth because

  he felt sorry for her;</p>
<p align="justify">(7) The one who did all the planning and demanding of the ransom was

  Vincent Lee;</p>
<p align="justify">(8) He was nave and stupid (instead of being a hardcore criminal);</p>
<p align="justify">(9) He should not be sentenced more harshly than Vincent Lee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 I made the following remarks at the conclusion of the trial:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1 No person anywhere should be subject to the agony, the anguish

  and the anxiety that both of you, together with Vincent Lee Chuan Leong, have inflicted on

  the victim, not least a 14-year old girl. One can easily emphatize with what this young

  female student must have felt during those dark 60 hours in September last year, not

  knowing where she was, what manner of persons were holding her in captivity and what

  horrible plans they might have in store for her. She was completely at the mercy of the

  three of you and could never be certain that the ransom money was all that you wanted.</p>
<p align="justify">2 She was not your only victim during those painful 60 hours. In every

  kidnap, there is at least one other person who suffers – the person from whom the

  ransom is demanded, who is willing to pay any price but may not be able to and often has

  to scramble frantically to muster the funds within a very short span of time. The three of

  you must have caused sleepless nights to the parents and family of this young female

  hostage. Although you may not have known it then, you have made her father’s birthday

  a very memorable one for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">3 The then Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>Sia Ah Kew &amp; Others v PP</i>
<nobr>[1972-1974] SLR 208</nobr> has said that it is a long and well established principle of

  sentencing that the legislature in fixing the maximum penalty for a criminal offence

  intends it only for the worst cases. The Court there also noted that the sentencing

  discretion given in cases of kidnapping for ransom was very limited in scope and said:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In our opinion, the maximum sentence prescribed by the

  legislature would be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or conduct

  of the kidnappers are such as to outrage the feelings of the community."</p>
<p align="justify">The Court also held that it was wrong to impose the alternative

  sentence of life imprisonment only when there were some very exceptional circumstances

  which did not justify the imposition of the death sentence. After noting that this type of

  crime was neither rampant nor on the increase in Singapore between 1970 and 1973 and after

  having regard to the fact that two of the five appellants in that case were armed with

  pistols and one with a dagger, the Court there set aside the sentences of death and

  substituted therefor sentences of life imprisonment with caning ranging from six to 12

  strokes. </p>
<p align="justify">4 In your case, it is to your credit that the victim was not hurt

  physically and that there is no indication that weapons were used. That is of immensely

  greater importance than the fact that some two thirds of the ransom money have been

  recovered. You say that the victim’s welfare was looked after – I am not sure

  being bundled into a van, having one’s limbs and lips bound with adhesive tapes, and

  then spending 60 hours in total darkness and fear merit such a description. This offence

  has certainly not been rampant for the past decade – in fact it was practically

  non-existent – but I am confident that our society does not feel nostalgic about it. </p>
<p align="justify">5 Due to the turn of events in Court, the acknowledged directing mind

  of this episode, Vincent Lee, pleaded guilty two days before the two of you did. He was

  sentenced to life imprisonment with no caning imposed. As noted in <i>Sia Ah Kew’s

  case</i>, there are only three sentencing options for this type of offence and Vincent

  Lee’s sentence is the most lenient permissible in law. </p>
<p align="justify">6 There is another principle of sentencing which dictates that there

  should be parity of sentences for accomplices unless there are some material

  distinguishing features in the roles that they played in the offence or in their personal

  circumstances. In your case, no such distinguishing feature has been brought to my

  attention as to justify a heavier penalty for the two of you in comparison with Vincent

  Lee. The death penalty is undoubtedly inappropriate in your case. To order caning would be

  to impose a harsher punishment on the two of you than that meted out to the originator of,

  and the main player in, this whole scheme. The only appropriate sentence for both of you

  is therefore one of life imprisonment, deemed to have commenced from the date of your

  arrest, 14 September 1999, and I so sentence both of you.</p>
<p align="justify">7 I thank Mr Francis Tseng and his team of DPPs and the Defence teams

  led by Mr Sng Kheng Huat and Mr Leo Cheng Suan for their efforts in bringing this episode

  to a swift conclusion. In addition, I must congratulate the team of investigators led so

  ably by ASP Richard Lim Beng Gee for their remarkable speed and admirable professionalism

  in apprehending all the offenders within 41 hours or so after confirmation of the safe

  return of the victim. </p>
<p align="justify">8 Finally, for Sandi Yong and her family, we wish you all well and hope

  that the emotional wounds you have suffered will begin to heal from this day forth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 Upon the application of the Prosecution, I ordered that the $214,400

recovered by the police be returned to the victim’s father and that there be a

disposal inquiry in the Subordinate Courts in respect of the vehicle (SBQ 7935 T) used to

collect the ransom money.</p>
