<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       By Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September
                    2004, Sambo E&amp;C Pte Ltd (“Sambo”) commenced an <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration against Econ Piling Pte Ltd
                    (“Econ”) and NCC International Aktiebolag (“NCC”).
                    On 25 October 2004, the High Court sanctioned the Scheme of Arrangement
                    (“the Scheme”) in respect of the debts and liabilities of Econ.
                    Five years later, Econ and NCC (hereinafter collectively referred to as
                    “ENJV”) applied by way of Originating Summons No 1084 of
                    2009/Z (“OS 1084/2009”) for the High Court to determine two
                    questions of law pursuant to s 45(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed). In response, Sambo applied by way of
                    Originating Summons No 54 of 2010/S (“OS 54/2010”) for
                    an additional question of law to be determined arising from the two questions of
                    law raised by ENJV. The key issue arising from the three questions of law raised
                    by both Sambo and ENJV is whether the joint liability of NCC as a partner of
                    Econ was released as a result of the Scheme which released the debts and
                    liabilities of Econ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The determination of the key issue would entail
                    a critical analysis of the scope of the principle that a release of a joint
                    debtor releases all other joint debtors. In <em>Deanplan Ltd v
                        Mahmoud</em> [1992] 1 WLR 467 (<em>“Deanplan Ltd”</em>), Judge Baker QC observed at 483
                    that this principle has been described by some as “illogical”.
                    Similarly, Steyn LJ (as he then was) in <em>Watts v
                        Aldington</em> [1999] L&amp;TR 578, has also described it as an
                    “absurd” rule that requires “re-examination”.
                    Nevertheless, it has withstood the test of time for more than a
                century.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I heard both OS 1084/2009 and OS 54/2010
                    together on 19 March 2010. On 23 March 2010, I delivered my oral
                    decision with brief grounds. In respect of the key question of law before me, I
                    arrived at the conclusion that the Scheme did not release NCC from its joint
                    liability with Econ. I now give my reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in 2001, the Land Transport Authority
                    (“LTA”) invited tenders to construct two underground stations at
                    Macpherson and Upper Paya Lebar including the tunnels between the two stations
                    and for other ancillary works (“the Contract”). NCC invited Econ
                    to submit a joint bid for the Contract. Econ and NCC then entered into a Joint
                    Venture Agreement dated 13 May 2002 (“the JVA”). Econ had a
                    55% interest while NCC had the balance 45% interest in the joint venture. The
                    JVA specifically provided that ENJV was not a partnership. Notwithstanding the
                    terms of the JVA, the High Court in Originating Summons No 694 of 2006
                    found that ENJV was in fact a partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In August 2002, ENJV’s tender for the
                    Contract was accepted by LTA. ENJV invited Sambo to submit a quotation for the
                    construction of the diaphragm walls and barrette pipe works for the two
                    underground stations (“the Sub-Contract”). By letter of award
                    dated 28 December 2002 and duly signed on 21 April 2003, ENJV engaged
                    Sambo as their domestic sub-contractor for the Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       By early 2003, Econ had fallen into financial
                    difficulties. Following Econ’s financial woes, the parties’
                    participating interests in the JVA were altered pursuant to a Deed of Variation
                    dated 22 May 2003 under which NCC’s interest was increased to 99.9%
                    leaving Econ with the balance 0.1%. Nothing turned on this variation.
                    Eventually, by an Order of Court dated 15 March 2004 in Originating
                    Petition No 24 of 2003, Econ was placed under judicial management and
                    Timothy James Reid was appointed as Econ’s judicial manager. On
                    15 September 2004, the Scheme was proposed by the judicial manager to
                    Econ’s creditors. The Scheme was approved by three-quarters in value of
                    the creditors of Econ. Thereafter, the Scheme was sanctioned by an Order of
                    Court dated 25 October 2004. Timothy James Reid was appointed the Scheme
                    administrator. The Scheme was duly administered by the Scheme administrator and
                    on 19 March 2009, the Scheme administrator, having completed the
                    distribution, applied for and was given a discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       One week after the Scheme was proposed by the
                    judicial manager but a month prior to the court’s sanction, Sambo
                    commenced an <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration against ENJV in
                    respect of claims arising under the Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Arising from the above undisputed facts, three
                    questions of law were referred to the High Court for determination by Sambo and
                    ENJV:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup>
                        Question of Law (OS 1084/2009)</p>

                        25 October 2004 in Originating Petition No 23 of 2003/Z, the
                        Defendants required the consent of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Plaintiff before the Defendants commenced against the Plaintiffs an
                            <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration by way of a Notice of
                        Arbitration dated 23 September 2004.</p>

                        accordance with the terms of the Scheme including (but not limited to)
                        clauses 1.2, 2 and 9 thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law (OS

<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>If the claims in the abovenamed
                        arbitration proceedings commenced by the Plaintiffs are compromised by the
                        Scheme of Arrangement dated 15 September 2004 (and sanctioned by an
                        Order of Court dated 25 October 2004 in Originating Petition No 23
                        of 2003/Z) against the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>Defendant and the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is released by such compromise
                        (if any), whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the partner
                        of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in ENJV at the material
                        time, was also released by the compromise (if
                any).”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">1<sup>st</sup> Question of Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The original question posed by ENJV for
                    determination was whether Sambo required the consent of Econ before Sambo could
                        <em>commence</em> the arbitration proceedings against
                    ENJV by way of Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2004. Counsel for
                    Sambo submitted that no such consent was required simply because the arbitration
                    proceedings were commenced prior to the Order of Court dated 25 October
                    2004 which sanctioned the Scheme. Technically, this submission was correct.
                    However, counsel for ENJV drew my attention to clause 4.1.3 of the Scheme
                    which provided that “no creditor shall, without the consent in writing of
                    Econ, take any step to <em>commence or continue</em> in
                    proceedings against the company for the adjudication of any claim.” It
                    was apparent that clause 4.1.3 of the Scheme applied not only to the
                    commencement of proceedings, but to its continuance as well. Accordingly, the
                    continuance of the arbitration proceedings commenced by Sambo did require the
                    consent in writing by Econ. I allowed ENJV to amend the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Question of Law to cover continuance of
                    the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the light of the amendment, counsel for
                    Sambo readily conceded that the 1<sup>st</sup> Question of
                    Law, as amended, would be answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">2<sup>nd</sup> Question of Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     A proper determination of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Question of Law would necessarily entail an
                    examination of the terms and legal effect of the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Purpose of the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The purpose of the Scheme can be gleaned from the following relevant provisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Scheme is a quasi-liquidation under which Creditors are largely afforded the same rights and obligations imposed by a liquidation process but with the additional gross realisation of $350,000 (less costs), resulting from the Investor seeking to purchase the shell of the Company, being available for distribution to the Creditors. If the Scheme is not approved the Judicial Manager will request the Court to discharge the Judicial Management Order and place the Company in liquidation.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.3</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Participating Creditors shall look only towards the Pool of Assets for the recovery of their debts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.5.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Each Participating Creditor shall accept his rights as stated in the Scheme as full and equivalent substitution of his original rights against the Company, and fully discharge and release the Company from any further liability under the original rights by assigning such original rights to the Investor.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.7</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Any Creditor who is entitled to participate in the Scheme, but who does not take all necessary steps as set out herein to participate in the Scheme, or is precluded from doing so pursuant to the terms of the Scheme, <em>shall have no Claim whatsoever against the Pool of Assets, the Company, the Judicial Manager or the Scheme Administrator. All Claims of such a Creditor shall be extinguished</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the above terms that the purpose of the Scheme was to compromise the rights and claims of all creditors against Econ and to fully discharge and release Econ from all further liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Scope and legal effect of the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Clause 1.2 of the Scheme defined the categories of creditors and types of claims that were subjected to the Scheme.</p>
<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="15.2007275561907%"/><col width="84.7992724438093%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top">

<p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“Creditors”</p>

<p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">All creditors of the Company, whether secured, preferential, contingent or unsecured, to whom a liability is owed by the Company, arising out of any transaction entered into or act or omission of the Company and/or any persons, carried out or which took place before the Fixed Date, whether their claims be liquidated or sounding only in damages and whether in contract or in tort howsoever arising and whether or not their claims have crystallised as at the Fixed Date and whether the creditors are based in Singapore or otherwise, including all related companies and related parties of the Company.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/>
<p class="Judg-1">It is self-evident from the above definitions that the Scheme applied to any claim of whatsoever nature by any creditor against Econ. Furthermore, it also applied to all creditors of Econ whether secured, preferential, contingent or unsecured to whom a liability was owed by Econ arising out of any transaction entered into or act or omission of Econ which took place before 16 September 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The authorities are clear that once a scheme of arrangement is sanctioned by an order of court, it binds all creditors including objecting creditors. This is clear from the decision of the High Court in <em>Re CEL Tractors Pte Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 700 (“<em>Re CEL Tractors</em>”) where the court held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    In my view s 210(3) should be given its plain meaning, ie that <em>an approved arrangement binds all the creditors. It cannot matter that an objecting creditor has not consented to be bound because he is nevertheless bound by the operation of law</em>. I do not see any reason why the arrangement has to have his support for the provision to take effect and for the arrangement to bind him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    I do not agree that an arrangement cannot discharge the liability of a party who is not a party to it. That view ignores the commercial framework of such arrangements…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    It should be remembered that a scheme of arrangement must have the support of the majority of the creditors and approved by court before it takes effect. After a scheme is accepted by the creditors, an objecting creditor can persuade the court to withhold its approval, or to approve it subject to such alternatives or conditions as it thinks fit (see s 210(4)). The objecting creditor would succeed if he can show that the creditors did not vote bona fide for the benefit of the creditors or the company as a whole…or that the scheme is not fair and reasonable...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel for Sambo acknowledged that the Scheme
                    operated to release Econ from all its liabilities including partnership
                    liabilities. This would include Econ’s partnership liabilities which arose
                    in the course of its partnership with NCC under the JVA. However, the ultimate
                    objective of ENJV’s application was to determine whether the Scheme had
                    released NCC from its joint partnership liabilities with Econ. Accordingly, a
                    determination of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Question of Law would
                    not be complete without examining the pivotal question of whether NCC was
                    released from its joint partnership liabilities with Econ. In this connection,
                    it was eminently sensible for Sambo to have framed the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law for
                determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     To avoid any ambiguity and to prevent any
                    overlap with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law, I determined
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Question of Law in the affirmative subject to
                    the qualification that the joint debts and liabilities of Econ as a partner in
                    any joint venture, including the JVA, were compromised or settled in accordance
                    with the terms of Scheme <em>in that no claim can be brought
                        against Econ in respect of such joint debts and liabilities</em> (the
                    qualification in italics). The qualification is necessary because the express
                    purpose of the Scheme was only to release Econ from all liabilities and
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The determination of the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law was hotly contested by both
                    parties. Counsel for ENJV submitted that NCC was released from its joint
                    liabilities with Econ as a legal consequence of the Scheme. The submission was
                    well crafted by counsel for ENJV in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, partnership liabilities of
                        Econ and NCC constituted a single joint liability. In support, ENJV relied
                        on s 9 of the Partnership Act which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Every partner in a firm is liable jointly with the other partners for
                            all debts and obligations of the firm incurred while he is a partner;
                            and after his death his estate is also severally liable in a due course
                            administration for such debts and obligations, so far as they remain
                            unsatisfied, but subject to the prior payment of his separate
                            debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Counsel for ENJV also directed my attention
                        to <em>Pirie v Richardson</em> [1927]
                        1 KB 448 which concerned a claim against a partnership for damages
                        for breach of contract. The partners pleaded separate defences. The court
                        accepted the defence pleaded by one of the partners. The other partners
                        applied to plead the same defence upon which the partner was successful but
                        the judge refused leave to amend. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held at 451
                        that “where there is a joint contract there is but one cause of
                        action, and the aggrieved party may sue all the joint contractors or he may
                        sue one of them, but for the purposes of that decision they all stand on the
                        same footing.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the legal effect of the Scheme had released all of
                        Econ’s liabilities including partnership liabilities. This explained
                        the purpose behind ENJV’s request for the determination of the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Question of Law which I have determined
                        above in the affirmative subject to the qualification. I should add that the
                        Scheme had also released all of Econ’s liabilities vis-à-vis NCC, the
                        significance of which I will elaborate below in connection with the
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, discharge of one joint debtor
                        by accord and satisfaction discharges all other joint debtors. The defendant
                        relied on <em>Morris v Wentworth-Stanley</em> [1999]
                        QB 1004. In that case, the plaintiff brought a claim against a
                        partnership for sums due under a contract for works done on a farm.
                        Eventually, the claim was settled and consent judgment was entered against
                        one of the partners for a compromised sum. The sum was not paid.
                        Subsequently, the son of the defaulting partner settled the compromised
                        judgment debt. The plaintiff then commenced a separate action against
                        another partner for the same debt less the payment received. The court held
                        at 1011 that the “discharge of one joint debtor by accord and
                        satisfaction discharges all other joint debtors in accordance with the
                        general principle that a joint liability creates only a single
                        obligation”, and that a plaintiff who sued the other co-debtor in a
                        separate action later might be viewed as having committed an abuse of
                        process (at 1018).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Scheme which discharged all the liabilities of Econ was
                        equivalent to accord and satisfaction which thereby discharged NCC’s
                        joint partnership liabilities to Sambo as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At face value, ENJV’s submission
                    appeared to be very appealing and seemingly simple. In response, counsel for
                    Sambo essentially accepted the first three planks of ENJV’s submission.
                    However, Sambo disagreed with ENJV that the Scheme had the same legal effect as
                    accord and satisfaction. Sambo drew a critical distinction between release by
                    accord and satisfaction and release by operation of law. Sambo submitted that
                    the release of Econ’s liabilities under the Scheme was by operation of law
                    and it did not constitute accord and satisfaction such as to release NCC from
                    its joint partnership liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There was at least one area where both parties
                    were on common ground. They both accepted that the issue whether a release
                    constituted accord and satisfaction of joint debts/liabilities is essentially a
                    question of construction. In <em>Deanplan Ltd</em>, the
                    court held at 483 that whether a release of one joint debtor was by way of
                    accord and satisfaction is a question of construction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From this long review of the cases, I draw the following conclusions.
                        First, a release of one joint contractor releases the others. There is only
                        one obligation. A release may be under seal or by accord and satisfaction. A
                        covenant not to sue is not a release. It is merely a contract between the
                        creditor and the joint debtor which does not affect the liabilities of the
                        other joint contractors or their rights of contribution or indemnity against
                        their co-contractor. <em>It is a question of construction of
                            the contract between the creditor and joint debtor in the light of the
                            surrounding circumstances whether the contract amounts to a release or
                            merely a contract not to sue</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Release by operation of law versus release by accord and
                satisfaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     ENJV cited a number of authorities in support
                    of the proposition that discharge of a joint debtor by accord and satisfaction
                    discharges all other joint debtors. None of the cases concerned release by
                    operation of law. In each of those cases, the discharge was pursuant to an
                    agreement with the creditor and it was on that basis that the court held that
                    the release and discharge by the creditor constituted accord and satisfaction.
                    Counsel for ENJV was, however, not able to refer me to any authority that the
                    discharge of a joint debtor’s liability under a scheme of arrangement or
                    by operation of law is either tantamount to accord and satisfaction or has the
                    legal effect of discharging the other joint debtors as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the other hand, the authorities cited by
                    Sambo were more germane to the determination of the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law. In the case of <em>In re Garner’s Motors Limited</em>
                    [1937] Ch 594 (“<em>In re
                    Garner</em>”), two companies (Sentinel and Garner’s Motors)
                    were jointly liable to Temple Press Ltd. Sentinel went into receivership and a
                    scheme of arrangement was proposed and sanctioned by the court. Temple Press Ltd
                    accepted a compromised payment under the scheme. Garner’s Motors
                    subsequently went into liquidation and Temple Press Ltd filed a proof of debt
                    for the balance amount owing. The proof of debt was rejected by the liquidator.
                    When the dispute was referred to court, Crossman J held that the scheme did
                    not have the legal effect of discharging the joint liability of Garner’s
                    Motors. The court highlighted the fact that the scheme only discharged the
                    liability of one of the joint debtors, <em>ie</em>
                    Sentinel, by operation of law and did not discharge the other joint debtors,
                        <em>ie</em> Garner’s Motors. The following
                    passage from the decision (at 598-599) is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that accord and satisfaction between a creditor and one
                        of several debtors, who are jointly and severally liable to the creditor,
                        discharges the other debtors unless it appears from the terms of the
                        agreement or the surrounding circumstances that the creditor intended to
                        reserve his rights against them. <em>But in my judgment a
                            discharge of one of several joint debtors by operation of law does not
                            discharge the other debtors. In my judgment the effect of s. 153 of
                            the Companies Act, 1929, is to give to a scheme when sanctioned by the
                            Court under the section a statutory operation. The scheme when
                            sanctioned by the Court becomes something quite different from a mere
                            agreement signed by the parties. It becomes a statutory
                            scheme</em>. In my judgment, therefore, <em>the
                            discharge of Sentinel Waggon Works, Ld., from the debt to Temple Press,
                            Ld., which was effected under clause 15 of the scheme sanctioned by the
                            Court on March 23, 1936, did not have the effect of discharging
                            Garner’s Motors, Ld., from its liability in respect of the
                            debt</em>. It is settled law that a discharge of one of several
                        judgment-debtors by operation of law does not release the other debtors. But
                        in my judgment the effect of s. 153 of the Companies Act, 1929, is to
                        give a scheme when sanctioned by the Court a statutory operation. Per
                        Crossman J at 598-599.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This distinction received judicial endorsement
                    in Australia in the decision of <em>Hill v Anderson Meat
                        Industries</em> [1971] 1 NSWLR 868 (“<em>Hill v Anderson</em>”). Anderson Meat Industries Ltd
                    (“Anderson”) and its five subsidiaries fell into financial
                    difficulties and a scheme of arrangement was agreed between the subsidiaries and
                    their creditors. Under the terms of the scheme, the debts of the subsidiaries
                    were extinguished upon payment of a compromised sum to the creditors. One of the
                    subsidiaries was indebted to Mrs Hill and the debt was guaranteed by
                    Anderson. However, the scheme did not specifically discharge the guarantees that
                    were provided in respect of the debts and liabilities of the subsidiaries. The
                    court held that the guarantee provided by Anderson for the debt of the
                    subsidiary was not discharged by the scheme. Significantly, the court held that
                    the scheme only applied to the relationship between the debtor and its creditors
                    and did not concern the guarantor in the absence of any special arrangement in
                    the guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The decision was affirmed on appeal. Although
                    the Court of Appeal agreed that a guarantee is an accessory obligation and that
                    upon extinguishment of the principal debt there would be no principal debt to
                    which the accessory liability could attach, it nonetheless held that the
                    principle regarding discharge or release of a guarantor did not apply where the
                    obligation of the principal debtor was discharged by operation of law. This was
                    clear from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Hill v
                        Anderson Meat Industries</em> [1972] 2 NSWLR 704
                        (“<em>Hill v Anderson CA</em>”) at
                    706:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What has been submitted to this Court is that by the terms of the scheme,
                        particularly cl. 3 which I have set out, the debt owing by the packing
                        company to Mrs Hill is extinguished. Next, because a guarantee is an
                        accessory obligation, upon the extinguishment of the principal indebtedness
                        the guarantee goes also, as a result of the fact that there is no principal
                        debt to which the accessory liability can attach. <em>It is
                            conceded, as of course it must be, that these principles do not apply
                            where the obligation is extinguished by operation of law, as for
                            instance in the case of bankruptcy or the winding up of a company, but
                            it is submitted that the obligation in the present case is not
                            extinguished by operation of law but rather is extinguished by the terms
                            of the scheme which impose not only upon those creditors who assent to
                            it, but upon all creditors, the effect of the document which constitutes
                            the scheme</em>. In this way it is submitted that the cases which
                        are referred to by Street J are distinguishable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The argument is not substantially different from that which was propounded
                        before the judge at first instance. He rejected it upon the ground that
                        there is in fact a discharge of the obligation by operation of the law. I
                        agree with this conclusion. Mrs Hill was never a party to the release
                        of the obligation. The release came through the operation of a law which
                        bound her as though she were a party. This seems to me in principle to be
                        within that line of authority which so clearly establishes that the
                        extinguishment of a principal obligation, when it is brought about by
                        operation of law, does not result in a discharge of the surety.</p>

                        guarantor for the same debts or liabilities of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Several of the decisions where the court
                    recognised the distinction between the release by operation of law and release
                    by accord and satisfaction in the context of a scheme of arrangement (<em>eg In re London Chartered Bank of Australia</em> [1893]
                    3 Ch 540 and <em>Hill v Anderson</em>) drew
                    support from <em>Ex parte Jacobs, In re Jacobs</em> (1875)
                    LR 10 Ch App 211 (“<em>In re
                        Jacobs</em>”). Counsel for ENJV submitted that the decision was
                    of no assistance because it was based on the UK Bankruptcy Act 1869 (c 71)
                    and was not a case involving a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”). With respect,
                    this distinction has missed the point. In <em>In re
                        Jacobs</em>, the claimant was the holder of a bill of exchange which
                    was drawn by the defendant and accepted by one Philips. The bill of exchange was
                    dishonoured and Philips as acceptor called for a meeting of his creditors
                    pursuant to the UK Bankruptcy Act 1869. At the meeting, the majority of the
                    creditors voted in favour of receiving a composition from Philips including the
                    plaintiff. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a claim against the defendant as
                    drawer of the bill of exchange. In defence, the drawer alleged that he was
                    discharged from liability under the bill of exchange as the plaintiff had
                    accepted the composition from Philips. The court, however, held that as the
                    acceptor was discharged only by operation of law, the liability of the drawer to
                    the holder remained unaffected. James LJ at 213 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There can be no doubt that, if the holder of a bill, by becoming party to
                        a deed or agreement, independently of any bankruptcy Act, agrees to accept a
                        composition from the acceptor, he thereby discharges the drawer; but, on the
                        other hand, it is equally clear that if the acceptor is discharged from his
                        liability by operation of law by becoming a bankrupt, the liability of the
                        drawer to the holder is not thereby affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The common denominator in each of these cases
                    was the consistent recognition by the courts that a release by operation of law,
                    be it under the Bankruptcy Act 1869 or under a scheme of arrangement, did not
                    release the other joint or co-debtors from their liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I accept that the specific issue that
                    confronted the court in a number of the above decisions did not specifically
                    concern partnership liabilities. ENJV acknowledged that <em>In re
                        Garner</em> did concern a joint liability under a contract. In my
                    view, the crucial point to note is the consistent distinction drawn by the
                    courts in several jurisdictions that a release by operation of law does not have
                    the same legal effect as accord and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     ENJV in recognising that <em>In
                        re Garner</em> is on point, sought to distinguish the decision on the
                    basis that it does not represent the law in Singapore because in Singapore,
                    unlike the position in the UK or Australia, a release under a scheme of
                    arrangement is not by operation of law. Instead, ENJV submitted that a scheme is
                    consensual in nature. <em>The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v
                        Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 121
                        (“<em>Oriental Insurance</em>”) was cited
                    as authority for this somewhat novel submission. In <em>Oriental
                        Insurance</em>, the issue before the court was whether it had the
                    residual jurisdiction to extend time for a creditor to file its proof of debt
                    under the scheme. At first instance, the High Court, adopting the English
                    approach embodied in the Privy Council decision in <em>Kempe v
                        Ambassador Insurance Co</em> [1998] 1 WLR 271, came to the
                    view that the scheme operated like a statutory contract and save for cases of
                    mistake or fraud, the court did not have the jurisdiction to extend time. On
                    appeal, the decision was reversed. The Court of Appeal preferred the Australian
                    approach over the English position in holding that a scheme of arrangement
                    derived its efficacy not from the statute but from the order of court approving
                    the scheme. The scheme therefore did not operate as a statutory contract under
                    which the court had abdicated the powers conferred on it by s 210 of the
                    Companies Act. By holding that a scheme of arrangement does not operate as a
                    statutory contract, it does not follow that a scheme of arrangement is therefore
                    consensual in nature. The underlying flaw in ENJV’s submission is that it
                    regarded a statutory contract and release by operation of law as one and the
                    same. However, that is not so. Instead they represent separate and distinct
                    points of law and are not to be confused one for the other. It seems to me that
                    the decision in <em>Oriental Insurance</em> only served to
                    reinforce the trite proposition that a scheme of arrangement and its attendant
                    legal consequences owe its efficacy entirely to the order of court that
                    sanctioned it. Put simply, it amounts to a release by operation of
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Interestingly, the Court of Appeal observed in
                        <em>Oriental Insurance</em> at [67] that a scheme is
                    contractual if all the creditors agree. The Court of Appeal in <em>Daewoo</em> also made a similar observation at [24] that a
                    scheme that is approved by all creditors is binding on the creditors and the
                    company because such a scheme would be wholly contractual in nature and there
                    would be no requirement to invoke s 210 of the Companies Act. In the
                    present case, the Scheme was not approved by all of the creditors. Therefore,
                    contrary to ENJV’s submission, the Scheme could hardly be described as
                    consensual such as to constitute accord and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In further support that a scheme of
                    arrangement is consensual in nature, Counsel for ENJV also relied on <em>Johnson and Another v Davies and Another</em> [1998]
                    3 WLR. 1299 (“<em>Johnson</em>”).
                    The case considered the effect of a voluntary arrangement under s 260 of
                    the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (“the UK Insolvency Act”).
                    Chadwick LJ observed that a voluntary arrangement is treated as
                    “consensual”. However on a close scrutiny of the decision, it
                    would be apparent that it does not support ENJV’s submission that a
                    release under a scheme of arrangement is likewise consensual and not by
                    operation of law. In that case, the plaintiffs were the sureties of the lease
                    taken out in the name of their company. The plaintiffs then sold their shares in
                    the company to the two defendants and one Hopkins. In the sale agreement, the
                    two defendants and Hopkins covenanted to indemnify the plaintiffs against all
                    claims arising out of the lease. The company subsequently went into receivership
                    and the plaintiffs paid the claims under their sureties. Hopkins then entered
                    into a voluntary arrangement with his creditors under the UK Insolvency Act. The
                    plaintiffs were given notice of the meeting and the arrangement was approved by
                    the creditors. Thereafter, the plaintiffs brought a claim against the two
                    defendants to recover the sums paid under the lease as sureties. Before the
                    Deputy District Judge, the court held that the defendants were discharged from
                    liability as a result of the voluntary arrangement entered into between Hopkins
                    and his creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On appeal, the decision was reversed by the
                    High Court who held that the agreement was merely a covenant not to sue. The
                    defendants then appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed the appeal, albeit
                    on different grounds. The Court of Appeal agreed that the discharge of a debtor
                    under the voluntary arrangement depended entirely on the terms of the
                    arrangement. It held that the voluntary arrangement in that case did not amount
                    to a release of Hopkins’ liabilities due to the presence of inconsistent
                    provisions in the voluntary arrangement. Although that finding was sufficient to
                    dispose of the appeal, the Court of Appeal nevertheless went on to consider the
                    nature and legal effect of the voluntary arrangement under the UK Insolvency
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In my view, the decision in <em>Johnson</em> does not take ENJV’s case any further. In
                        <em>Johnson</em>, the court traced the history of the
                    UK Insolvency Act and how it evolved to its present state from the UK Bankruptcy
                    Act, 1869. It concluded that the UK Insolvency Act was not a consolidating Act,
                    and therefore there was no presumption that it was not intended to change the
                    existing law. The court also found that there is a crucial difference in the two
                    legislations in that discharge under the UK Bankruptcy Act, 1869 took effect
                    from the statute while discharge under the UK Insolvency Act took effect from
                    the scheme which becomes operative when sanctioned by the court. Crucially, the
                    court treated the voluntary arrangement under s 260 of the UK Insolvency
                    Act as consensual in nature because, it created a statutory hypothesis that the
                    approved voluntary arrangement binds every person “as if he were a party
                    to the arrangement.” Accordingly, it is clear that the court’s
                    treatment of a voluntary arrangement as consensual was premised entirely on the
                    specific wording of the UK Insolvency Act. In <em>Daewoo</em>, the Court of Appeal was invited to consider <em>Johnson</em> but declined from doing so as it was not
                    necessary for the purposes of that case. Nonetheless it observed that <em>Johnson</em> “was based on the express wording in
                    s 260 of the Insolvency Act 1986.” There is no local equivalent of
                    s 260 of the UK Insolvency Act. Section 210(3) of the Companies Act simply
                    provides that a scheme of arrangement “shall, if approved by order of the
                    Court, be binding on all creditors or class of creditors…as the case may
                    be.” As pointed out above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> the
                    position in Singapore is that a scheme of arrangement is only treated as
                    consensual if all the creditors agree: <em>Oriental
                        Insurance</em> and <em>Daewoo</em>. In any event,
                    there is clear authority that a scheme of arrangement is regarded as a release
                    by operation of law: <em>Re CEL Tractors</em>. This is no
                    different from the position in the UK (<em>In re
                        Garner</em>), Australia (<em>Hill v
                    Anderson</em>), Hong Kong (<em>The Bank of Canton v Mak Lai
                        Ting and Others</em> [1923] HKLR 27 (“<em>The Bank of Canton</em>”) and New Zealand (<em>Re Southern World Airlines</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Finally, the Court of Appeal in <em>Johnson</em> observed that the question whether co-debtors
                    and sureties should be discharged as a consequence of a voluntary arrangement is
                    a matter of policy. In that regard, it was observed that there was merit in the
                    argument that the release of a joint or co-debtor would not be complete if it
                    could be frustrated by an action of a co-debtor in enforcing rights of
                    contribution. Obviously, this policy consideration would be irrelevant if the
                    co-debtor is unable to seek contribution against the released co-debtor by
                    operation of law or by the terms of the court order approving the arrangement or
                    the scheme as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is reservation of rights necessary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In addition, ENJV also submitted that in the
                    absence of any reservation of rights against a joint-debtor, the default
                    position is that the release of a joint-debtor releases all the other
                    joint-debtors. ENJV contended that Sambo did not raise any objection or
                    reservation to the terms of the Scheme and having failed to do, should be bound
                    by the Scheme. This proposition presupposed that there was a requirement for
                    Sambo to have reserved its rights against NCC when the Scheme was approved
                    pursuant to the order of court. This submission, according to ENJV, found
                    support in <em>In Re E.W.A., A debtor</em> [1901]
                    2 KB 642 at 648-649 (“<em>In Re
                    E.W.A</em>.”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is not disputed that the rule of law applies, namely, that the
                        release of one of two joint debtors has the effect of releasing the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]lthough a document in terms purports to release one of two joint
                        debtors, yet it may contain in terms a reservation of rights against the
                        other joint debtor. Where you find these two provisions, you construe the
                        document not as a release but merely as an undertaking not to sue a
                        particular individual and the result is that the right to proceed against
                        the co-debtor is reserved and can be put in force against him. Whenever you
                        can find from the terms of the document an agreement for the reservation of
                        rights against the co-debtor, then, I agree, the document cannot be
                        construed as an accord and satisfaction of the joint debt and therefore as a
                        release of the co-debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     
          <em>In Re E.W.A</em>. was
                    a case where the release was not by operation of law. In cases involving release
                    by operation of law, reservation of rights is strictly not necessary in the
                    first place. In <em>In Re London Chartered Bank of
                        Australia</em> [1893] 3 Ch 540, an objection was raised to
                    the scheme on the ground that the rights of the creditors were not reserved
                    against the sureties of the company. The court at 546-547 held that there was no
                    need for such a reservation since the release was by operation of law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The scheme contains no release of the bank or the contributories; it
                        contains no covenant not to sue, and it is by operation of law that the
                        scheme becomes effective to relieve the company and contributories from
                        further liability than that contemplated or imposed by the scheme. The
                        scheme of arrangement under the Act of 1870 is…an alternative mode of
                        liquidation which the law allows the statutory majority of creditors to
                        substitute for the pending winding-up, whether voluntary or under the Court,
                        just as the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, allowed the creditors the substituted
                        liquidation by arrangement under sect. 125, or composition under sect. 126,
                        of that Act, for a pending bankruptcy. The discharge of the bankrupt in such
                        case was statutory and not conventional, and therefore by operation of law.
                        Just so here under the Act of 1870. The discharge of the company or
                        contributories under the Joint Stock Companies Arrangement Act, 1870, is by
                        operation of law effected by the stay of actions imposed…<em>It seems to me, then, that, the discharge being clearly by
                            operation of law consequent upon statutory liquidation, the principles
                            laid down by Lord Justice Mellish in In re Jacobs
                            (1875) LR 10 Ch App 211 apply, and that, therefore,
                            there is no need, and it would not be right, to introduce a reservation
                            of rights against sureties into the scheme of arrangement</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore, ENJV submitted that the cases
                    relied on by Sambo did not concern partnership liabilities. I do not agree that
                    this is a valid distinction. The principle governs all joint liabilities.
                    Partnership liability is but a species of joint liability and should be treated
                    no differently from joint liability under a contract or accessory liability
                    under a guarantee. In either case, a release by accord and satisfaction of the
                    joint-debtor, as distinct from release by operation of law, would release the
                    other joint-debtor or guarantor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The fact that no distinction should be drawn
                    between a discharge by operation of law in respect of a joint debtor and a
                    surety in the context of a scheme of arrangement was reaffirmed in the Hong Kong
                    decision of <em>The Bank of Canton</em>. In that case, an
                    action was brought against several defendants as makers, jointly and severally,
                    of a promissory note. Two of the defendants also stamped the promissory note as
                    guarantors. In resisting an application for summary judgment, the defendants
                    contended that since one of the defendants has already been discharged pursuant
                    to a scheme of arrangement, they were all likewise discharged as the debt was a
                    joint debt. The court disagreed and held at 30:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, there is no distinction in law in the case of joint
                        liability on an instrument between principals and sureties, the discharge of
                        one, <em>prima facie</em>, operates as a discharge of
                        all, but where the principal debt is gone by operation of law, as in this
                        case the legal position of joint debtors (whether the liability is joint or
                        several) and sureties is the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">No express provision to release any third party under the
                Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is not disputed that the Scheme did not
                    expressly provide for NCC to be released from its joint partnership liabilities
                    with Econ. The position would be different if the Scheme had provided for the
                    release of NCC’s joint liabilities as well. Indeed this was precisely the
                    experience in <em>Daewoo</em> where the court (at [22],
                    [23] and [32]) gave effect to an express term under a scheme of arrangement
                    whereby the guarantor of the company’s debts was discharged from its
                    liability under the guarantee:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    It seems to us that in this case there are really
                            two issues for determination. The first is whether it is permissible to
                            incorporate in a scheme of arrangement or compromise under s 210 of
                            the Companies Act, as was incorporated in the present scheme under
                            consideration, a term to the effect that, upon the company performing
                            its obligations as regards payments and other things vis-à-vis the
                            creditors under the scheme, the creditors will release the guarantors
                            from their obligations under the respective guarantee. The second is
                            whether such a term is valid and effectual for the
                        purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    On the first question, we can see no reason in
                            principle why a scheme of arrangement or compromise under s 210 of
                            the Companies Act cannot incorporate such a term. No cases have been
                            cited to us to say that such a term cannot be embodied in a scheme.
                            After all, a scheme of arrangement or compromise proposed by a company
                            to be made with its creditors or a class of creditors under s 210
                            of the Companies Act is no more than a proposal to vary or modify its
                            obligations in relation to its debts and liabilities owed to its
                            creditors or a class of creditors on certain terms and
                            conditions…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s the scheme is binding on the company and its creditors, there is no
                        reason in principle why the company cannot in principle enforce the terms of
                        the scheme as against the creditors. It must be borne in mind that the
                        scheme contains reciprocal rights and obligations of the company and the
                        creditors, and once the company has observed and performed all its
                        obligations under the scheme, the creditors likewise must observe and
                        perform their obligations thereunder, and if they fail or refuse to do so,
                        the company is entitled to take proceedings to enforce their obligations
                        under the scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the governing principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     From my review of the cases cited by both
                    parties, the following principles can be derived:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Even in cases of release of a
                        joint-debtor by a creditor, it is still a question of construction whether
                        the release constituted accord and satisfaction so as to release the other
                        joint-debtors. The release could on a true construction merely amount to a
                        covenant not to sue in which event the joint-debtor is not released from the
                        joint liability. In other words, there is no default rule that a release of
                        a joint-debtor would invariably release the other
                    joint-debtors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        law recognises a clear distinction between release by accord and
                        satisfaction and release by operation of law. It is only in the former case
                        that the joint-debtors are likewise released from such joint
                        liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     In
                        cases where a joint-debtor is released by operation of law such as a scheme
                        of arrangement, the release applies only to the joint-debtor under the
                        scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        scheme of arrangement would only release third parties, <em>ie</em> any party other than the company, if the court order
                        specifically provides for such release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The position becomes even clearer when the
                        <em>raison d’etre</em> of the principle regarding
                    release of joint-debtors is carefully scrutinised and understood. It has been
                    expressed in various ways though they effectively refer to the same
                    mischief:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     If the joint-debtor who has not been
                        released is sued, he has a right to enforce contribution from the other
                        joint-debtor and if that right remains, then the release of the joint-debtor
                        is not complete: <em>Ex parte Good; In re Armitage</em>
                        (1876) 5 Ch D 46 at 51.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     In bringing another action to recover the balance amount
                        from other joint-debtors, the creditor commits a breach of the contract to
                        the released joint-debtor for such an action would inevitably lead to the
                        very claim from which the release has been purchased by accord and
                        satisfaction: <em>Deanplan Ltd</em> at
                    483.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Neither of the above reasons would be relevant
                    in the context of a release under the Scheme. First, the release of Econ under
                    the Scheme was in fact complete because NCC cannot seek contribution from Econ
                    when sued by Sambo as the Scheme has also compromised and released all of
                    NCC’s claims against Econ. (see para 17(b) above) Secondly, unlike
                    release by accord and satisfaction, under the terms of the Scheme, all creditors
                    including Sambo, have only agreed or deemed to have agreed that they have no
                    further claims whatsoever against Econ. There was no undertaking or confirmation
                    by the creditors that they will drop any claims that they have against third
                    parties like NCC for its joint liabilities. Accordingly, any claim brought
                    against NCC would not be in breach of any contract or undertaking to
                    Econ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the circumstances, as there was no express
                    provision under the Scheme that has released NCC from its joint liabilities to
                    Sambo, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Question of Law must be answered in
                    the negative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I would like to record my appreciation to both
                    counsel for their well researched and ably presented submissions, both written
                    and oral. I found their submissions to be extremely helpful in enabling me to
                    distil the issues to arrive at my determination in a timely
                manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It is clear to me, both as a matter of law as
                    well as on a true construction of the terms of the Scheme, that NCC was not
                    released from its joint liabilities to Sambo. If ENJV is right in its
                    submission, it would mean that NCC would enjoy an unexpected
                    “windfall” in being released from its joint liability to Sambo, a
                    consequence which was neither contemplated nor intended under the Scheme. The
                    very fact that ENJV took five years to raise this issue after the Scheme was
                    sanctioned bears testimony to my observation that such a
                    “windfall” would indeed be unexpected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I ordered the costs of both applications to be
                    costs in the arbitration.</p>
