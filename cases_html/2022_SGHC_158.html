However, the PA (which was unsigned) did not embody the terms of the Employment Agreements which Dways claimed were oral, and instead contradicted Nancy’s claim as it stated that Irene would be the CFO with Justin as the Chief Operating Officer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Dways also relies on name cards printed for the Four Persons and specifically Justin’s name card which stated he was “Founder and CFO”, to support the existence of Justin’s Employment Agreement. I find this to be equivocal. First, the WhatsApp chats showed the discussions pertaining to the name cards and the Four Persons’ respective designations in Dways started around mid-June 2019,

Second, I accept Irene’s explanation that the Lims never used the name cards. A document entitled “Order of namecards”, which indicated the name and designation printed on each name card, was not signed by the Lims. This supported Irene’s claim that when the name cards were ready, the Lims chose not to acknowledge receipt of them or collect them as Justin did not eventually agree to being appointed CFO.

The informal manner in which Dways’ business was run contradicts Nancy’s testimony that the Four Persons had agreed that Justin should have a <span class="font-italic">formal</span> position in Dways.

For instance, on 20 December 2019, when Nancy said that she did not have the tokens for the Bank Accounts and requested to be able to make transfers and payments online while Irene was travelling, Irene assured Nancy that she (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Irene) would still be able to make payments even if she were away as she “[took] charge of accounts”. In court, Irene agreed that she was in charge of making payments for Dways and she had prepared a spreadsheet of payments Dways had made to its suppliers and vendors. Likewise, Irene had signed off as “CFO” on an invoice (see [11] above). She also updated Nancy on the balances in Dways’ accounts and kept a record of the transactions in its accounts.

Irene admitted that she wanted to control the Bank Accounts because she suspected Nancy was taking Products without paying for them and, if she relinquished the bank tokens to Nancy, she would lose access to online banking to check the Bank Accounts. This showed that Irene was at that time the sole person effecting transfers and making payments from the Bank Accounts. Hence, even if Nancy was still able to sign cheques independently as the Lims claimed, Irene was by December 2019 in sole control over the OCBC Account.

Nancy admitted that she had access to Products whenever she requested as she was a director and doing sales; that from 3 December 2019, she had access to Products without having to make a request; and that in January 2020, she had taken HL Span from Dways’ cabinet.

</div> It should be noted that HL Span, Purity and B’Glo were received by Dways from the manufacturers only on 21 October, 1 November and 17 November 2019 respectively. As for B’Glo, there is no evidence that Nancy was denied access to it. In court, Nancy admitted (contrary to her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”)) that she had instructed the manufacturer to deliver B’Glo to the Lims’ Home and there is no evidence that she had objected to B’Glo being stored there.

</div> I reiterate that the Relevant Period started from March 2019, whereas Dways started receiving Products from only 21 October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Nancy admitted that Dways’ staff recorded information pertaining to Products in its books and computer system. This included a record pertaining to the movement of HL Span. I disbelieve that Nancy had been unaware of the existence of this record until the Lims exited Dways. Even if this were true, this did not show that the Lims had hidden the records from Nancy (as Nancy had tried to portray). Dways had a computer system which recorded information regarding its distributors, including the Products they purchased and the amounts paid to Dways, and I accept Irene’s testimony that Nancy and Dways’ staff had access to this system. I have also earlier found that the store and locker keys were kept in a drawer in Dways’ office which Nancy claimed had no lock.

</div> If Nancy claimed not to know about the inventory of stocks (or Dways’ financial position), it was because she did not at the material time bother to find out. Nancy was also a director of Dways and, as Zul attested, the intent was for the Four Persons to be involved in all aspects of Dways’ business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In this regard, Dways also claims that the Lims failed or refused to hand over Dways’ sales records and inventory after their exit. It points to WhatsApp messages from early February 2020 where Nancy had asked Justin to return “stocks records” and “updated stock accounts”. However, the WhatsApp messages showed Nancy subsequently acknowledging the Lims’ handing over of invoices and records of bank statements (although Nancy claimed they were incomplete). On Nancy’s account, Irene also left behind inventory records in Dways’ office which Nancy relied on to show the shareholders’ Arrangement that she claimed existed among the Four Persons (see [110] below on this Arrangement).

</div> Dways could not rely on the Employment Agreements which I have found not to exist. Moreover, Nancy agreed that it was the Chuas who conducted stock checks and made a record of the stocks. This is supported by the WhatsApp messages and Karen’s testimony that the Chuas were tasked to do so and that the records for the stock checks were placed in Dways’ office drawers. Indeed, Dways’ system of managing its inventory was decentralised and honour-based, where each person would record what he or she had taken. For instance, on 6 January 2020, when Karen stated in a WhatsApp message that there was a shortfall of 17 boxes of HL Span, Nancy responded to say that she had taken them a few days earlier and had “[a]lready written down today what [she had] taken”. Nancy also attested to an occasion in December 2019 where she took the Products first and made a record in Dways’ books later.

However, these messages do not show a general system in which Products taken were reported to Irene regularly as part of her purported stewardship of Dways’ inventory. Rather it showed that Nancy could take Products on her own without prior approval.

</div> As for the WhatsApp messages between Karen and Irene on 21 to 22 December 2019 and 30 January 2020 (which Dways relies on to show Irene’s alleged control over the inventory and sales records), they do not evidence a practice of Irene tallying Dways’ sales records or payments made for Products against its inventory. By this time, the relationship between the Lims and Nancy had deteriorated and the messages thereby related to Irene’s suspicion of Nancy taking Products without paying and to the Shareholders’ Entitlement to Products (see [110] below on the Shareholders’ Entitlement).

Nancy explained that she pre-signed the cheques because she trusted Irene and this arrangement was convenient as Dways had many payments to make and she did not meet Irene very often. Hence, it was not as if Nancy wanted to jointly operate Dways’ accounts or deal with transactions from the outset, but rather she willingly ceded control to Irene because she trusted her. She did not bother to look at the bank statements of the OCBC Account even when they were mailed to her home nor find out how to access internet banking for the UOB Account.

Yet, Nancy did not, then, object to its installation or express any concern as to its price. On 20 July 2019, Nancy had also in a separate WhatsApp chat with Karen asked Karen about the “mirror door”, which Karen replied to and exhibited photographs (being the same reply given on the Dway Office Reno chat).

</div> Thus, Nancy knew of the decision to procure the Frame. Nancy’s explanation that she did not see the messages in the Dway Office Reno chat cannot be believed, as she had separately spoken to Karen at the same time about a “mirror door”. Second, in the “DWay Accounts Updates” WhatsApp chat group (of which Nancy was a member), Irene had, on 23 September 2019, set out a list of items with corresponding amounts unpaid by Dways. This included the item “Office Mirror: (S$1580.00)”. Nancy did not express any concerns as to the installation or cost of the Mirror, despite expressing concerns on another item.

Indeed, despite knowing on around 4 September 2019 from Irene that Dways required its shareholders to top up its accounts (a point Dways relies on to show it was short of funds then), Nancy did not object to the procurement and installation of the Four Items.

Although Nancy initially claimed that Dways would offer a full refund if requested within 30 days of purchase of Products and the unconsumed Products were returned, she later stated that even if Dways’ customers asked for a refund after 90 days, Dways would still make the refund in genuine cases. Nancy herself had acceded to a refund for a customer Susan more than four months after Susan had purchased Products. It is also undisputed that one director can exercise the refund policy independently of, and without having to seek prior approval from, the other.

</div> This was unbelievable and contradicted Lionel’s Letter, which stated that Lionel did not find the Products suitable and that he was returning them. All these undermined the authenticity of Lionel’s Letter and the Lims’ claim that the payment to Lionel was a refund for returned Products. In any case, even if I accept that Lionel had requested for a refund, I would have found that Irene should not have caused Dways to refund moneys without Lionel returning the Products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As for Sandra’s Letter, Irene’s account in her AEIC was simply that Sandra had sent a letter to Dways on or about 1 February 2020. In court, she claimed that Karen had passed her the said letter on 1 February 2020 and told her that Sandra wanted a refund. Irene then made a copy of Sandra’s Letter before Justin handed the original to Nancy on 6 February 2020.

</div> But this account was absent in both Irene’s AEIC and Karen’s AEIC.

</div> Similarly, Irene claimed that Sandra had not even collected any Products when the refund was made to her. Again, I find this unconvincing and an afterthought made to explain away the lack of any Products being returned to justify a refund. All these undermined Irene’s purported purpose for making the payment to Sandra.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Likewise, I disbelieve that the two payments which Irene claimed were made to Wilano were for the purpose of refunding Wilano for Products that she had purchased. Dways’ bank transaction slips showed the two payments were made to <span class="font-italic">Irene’s bank account</span> and not to Wilano, contrary to what Irene had claimed in her AEIC. Even if Irene had passed $3,000 in cash to Wilano as she claimed in court, there was no reason to first transfer the moneys from Dways to her bank account, when she could have easily withdrawn cash from Dways’ Bank Accounts to hand to Wilano.

</div> Her action as such casts doubts on her claim that the $3,000 was made to Wilano and to refund her for Products that she had purchased. Likewise, Irene’s claim that Wilano had not yet collected any Products when the refund was made further undermined her purported purpose for making the payment to Wilano (even assuming the moneys were in fact paid to her).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In the round, Irene has failed to show the transfers of the moneys from Dways were for the purpose of refunding its distributors for Products that they had purchased.

The payments which were all made within a short span of time and purportedly as “refunds” to Wilano, Lionel and Sandra, coincided with the Lims exiting Dways after a deterioration in their relationship with Nancy. As Mr Maniam pointed out, Irene had sent a letter to some distributors in April 2021 which evinced her intent to deplete Dways of its moneys through refunds to the Lims’ friends and to leave a minimal amount in the Bank Accounts.

As I have found, Irene was the director primarily in charge of accounts and payments. She agreed that she was in charge of making payments to vendors and suppliers and she had even prepared a spreadsheet to show payments that Dways had made to them (see [17] above). Hence, the payments of the Three Sums would have been within Irene’s knowledge and the burden was on her to explain what they were for. Indeed, in other transactions where Irene caused Dways to issue cheques with a lump sum payment to reimburse her for Dways’ expenses, she could recall the breakdown of each item and its transaction value and she even kept her own internal records.

The Lims however claim that the Loan was authorised by and came from Dways, and that Nancy subsequently approved writing it off as a way of compensating the Chuas for having contributed substantially to Dways’ business and in exchange for them continuing to do so.

On 23 September 2019, when Irene was providing reports in the “DWay Accounts Updates” WhatsApp chat group (which comprised the Four Persons), she stated “there is a loan amount to Steven Karen of S$30,000”. Irene herself thus treated the Loan as outstanding, even after the 14 August 2019 meeting at Crown Café. On 5 December 2019, Nancy messaged the Chuas to state that the outstanding Loan was supposed to have been settled in October but it was now December. Yet the Chuas did not refute her claim. Their explanation, that they had been on holiday and had subsequently clarified with Nancy about the Loan which Nancy then acknowledged had been written off, was but a bare assertion and unbelievable.

Nancy’s claim of three sums (of US$699, US$829 and US$1,527.20) was based on a misreading of the electronic cash wallet for the TLC Investment (“the Wallet”). The WhatsApp messages between Justin and Nancy (containing screenshots showing the total assets in the Wallet) reflected a sum of US$699 on 28 July 2019, which became US$829 on about 31 July 2019, and then US$1,527.20 on about 11 November 2019. Indeed, Justin’s 31 July 2019 WhatsApp message to Nancy described what was in the wallet as “[p]rofit U$829 in less than 2 weeks for DWAY888 invested 10,500”. The Wallet would show only one amount, which would increase or decrease depending on whether more profits were made or moneys withdrawn from it. There was therefore only one figure of US$1,527.20 that was due. As an aside, Justin explained that the amount in the Wallet was denominated in the cryptocurrency USDT, but this distinction was immaterial as 1 USDT is equivalent to US$1. In any event, the parties’ submissions did not distinguish between 1 USDT and US$1.

</div> However, this does not therefore mean that Justin was privy to the payments that Irene was making from the Bank Accounts, much less that he conspired with her to cause Dways to make them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the above regard, I also find that Dways has not shown that Justin was a custodial fiduciary (see in this regard <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1199 at [106]). I find that Dways has not shown that Justin had control over Dways’ funds and the existence of Justin’s Employment Agreement. As for Irene, I find that she was a custodial fiduciary of Dways’ Bank Accounts, based on my earlier findings on her role in Dways . Also, by December 2019, Irene took steps to give herself greater control over the Bank Accounts (see [22] and [24] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 That said, it is unnecessary to order an account of Dways’ accounts or the Disputed Payments made without legitimate or proper basis. The partnership between the Lims and Nancy/Zul lasted merely a year from early 2019 to February 2020 and Dways would have identified all the transactions from the Bank Accounts during this period to arrive at its list of Disputed Payments (and which it even pared down at the close of the trial). Dways’ loss is already quantifiable by reference to the amounts that were withdrawn from the Bank Accounts for each of the transactions that I have found Irene to be liable on. While Dways may elect whether to call for an account, it is the court which always has the last word (<span class="font-italic">UVJ and others v UVH and others and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 336 at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As for the Allowances, I find that Justin had conspired with Irene to withdraw the $21,000 from the UOB Account and that they did so with intent to injure or damage Dways. The Lims were not entitled to the Allowances and Nancy was unaware of and did not consent to its withdrawal at the material time. I find that Irene had made the withdrawal with Justin’s agreement and knowledge as he would benefit from a share of the Allowances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I accept Dways’ assertion that the $21,000 withdrawal (as with other Disputed Payments such as items 6, and 10 to 14 of the Table at [33], all made when the Lims were intending to exit or were exiting Dways) was intended to deplete its accounts when the Lims exited the company. In particular, the $21,000 withdrawal was done to deplete the UOB Account by Irene in concert with Justin. On 1 February 2020, the UOB Account had $27,981.19 before the $21,000 was transferred out on the same date, leaving a balance of $6,981.19. When Irene ceased to be a director on 5 February 2020, the UOB Account had about $150. This was partly because she had caused further payments to be made that were not for proper purposes (items 10 and 11 of the Disputed Payments amounting to $1,980).

However, one to two boxes each of HL Span and Purity would have been sufficient for an individual’s consumption per month, and hence the rest were meant for distribution to potential distributors or customers. As the purpose for this arrangement was to allow the Four Persons to better market the Products, if any one of them ceased to be a shareholder, he or she would no longer be allowed to take any Products.

</div> In the final analysis, I find that each of the Four Persons were entitled to no more than two boxes of HL Span, three boxes of Purity and two boxes of B’Glo per month for personal consumption (“Personal Entitlement”). In particular, in relation to Purity, whilst I have rejected Nancy’s account of the Arrangement pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">total </span>number of boxes of each Product that each of the Four Persons was entitled to in a month (being less than the total under the Shareholders’ Entitlement), I accept Nancy’s account that for the purposes of personal consumption, each of them was entitled to take three boxes of Purity (see [110] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I also accept Nancy’s testimony that the entitlement to Products would cease to apply to a shareholder who leaves Dways. The Lims were thus entitled to their respective Personal Entitlement up to January 2020, pursuant to the Shareholders’ Entitlement which had already been agreed on in 2019. When Justin met Nancy on 22 January 2020 to discuss the sale of the Lims’ shares, their relationship with Nancy had deteriorated and it was unlikely that the Lims intended to continue distributing Products for Dways, nor was there evidence that they did so. Consequently, when the Lims removed Products in January 2020, they were not entitled to take anything in excess of their Personal Entitlements. As for the Lims replacing B’Glo with Purity (which they claimed they were entitled to do) because they preferred the latter Product,

In this regard, Nancy claims the Product Record showed that, as at 10 November 2019, 50 boxes of HL Span, 35 boxes of Purity and 30 boxes of B’Glo were set aside pursuant to the Arrangement. But this is contradicted by: (a) Nancy’s assertion of the number of HL Span and Purity that each shareholder was entitled to take per month (which did not add up to the quantities in the Product Record); and (b) the exclusion of B’Glo from the Arrangement (whereas the Product Record recorded quantities of B’Glo being set aside). The Product Record is also contradicted by Karen’s WhatsApp message to Irene on 22 December 2019, for instance, which showed that Nancy and Zul had taken 24 boxes of HL Span in December 2019 alone. Notably, Nancy admitted at trial that she probably took more than that (see [114] above). Nancy also admitted to having taken 17 boxes of HL Span in early January 2020 (see [30] above),

</div> Whilst it referred to Nancy’s and Zul’s conduct in Dways and impugned their integrity and reputation, read in totality, it also: (a) referred to Dways’ business being conducted in a dishonest and an improper manner by its “directors” (which was how Irene described the Four Persons); and (b) sought to weaken Dways’ business reputation by citing its mismanagement in terminating distributors unjustifiably. For instance, at the beginning of the 1st Letter, Irene stated that “[o]ur uplines were terminated due to this reason, they discovered Nancy &amp; Zul, that took many stocks to sell but the money they had collected went to their pockets instead of DWay accounts !” At the end of the letter, Irene stated “[f]or those that continue w DWay, good luck to you ! Do remember to withdraw your Commission. Do not work for FREE !” Finally, Irene admitted that when she wrote the words “Nancy felt that our uplines hv betrayed her by telling d ex-Directors of their stealing of stocks with no money banked into DWay accounts ! All of us did not expect Nancy to be so unscrupulous, unethical, immoral &amp; full of crooks !”, she wanted to create the impression that Dways was managed by a director who was unscrupulous, unethical, immoral and a crook.

Further, the statements meant and were understood to mean that Dways’ business was conducted in a dishonest and improper manner. They included allegations that Dways had actively misrepresented to its customers where its products were manufactured. For instance, one line stated that “[i]n your Product Presentation, you have told us that [Dways’] products are from one of these countries (USA or Australia or New Zealand), however, we later found out that you have lied to all of us!

The maker of the Report was not called and his evidence not tested in cross-examination. It is unclear whether he was even qualified to give an opinion on the safety or effects of HL Span.

Whilst these customers and distributors claimed that Zul or Nancy had informed them of the specific place of manufacture, none of them have provided documentary evidence to support this.

She then decided to become a distributor as the USA is a reputable country with high manufacturing standards for health supplements. She claimed that Zul made the same representations again at OPPs in November 2019. I disbelieve Vivianne’s claim that Zul had made such representations. Vivianne claimed that when she first found out from Justin on 13 February 2020 that the Products were manufactured in China, she became “extremely upset”, and this further convinced her that her father’s death was caused by his consumption of HL Span.

In her AEIC in July 2021, however, Doria stated that she was now able to recall that Zul told her the Products were manufactured in the USA. In cross-examination in September 2021, she then claimed that she “had a very strong impression on USA” because of Zul’s presentation.

</div> Her account is unbelievable. One would have thought that her recollection would have been better in February or March 2021, closer in time to her purchase of Products in 2019, rather than in July or September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I accept Dways’ submission that Doria tailored her evidence to assist Irene’s case. Doria had sent the WhatsApp messages to Denny to enquire on the Products’ country of manufacture on 7 March 2021, some five days before the Defendants informed Dways that they intended to call her as a witness in the Suit. Strangely, the only issue which Doria appeared to be interested in (when conversing with Denny) was the place of manufacture of the Products, despite claiming that she had messaged Denny because Yang had asked her over the phone to recommend health supplements and wanted more information about the Products.

</div> I disbelieve Doria that Yang had approached her to find out more about Dways’ Products. There was no record of any calls made between them. I find, as Mr Maniam put to Doria, that she had agreed to be Irene’s witness in the Suit by the time she communicated with Denny. Doria was Irene’s friend and her partiality to Irene can be seen from the fact that she attempted to downplay Irene’s role in Dways by claiming (repeatedly) in court that Irene did not at that time inform her that Irene was selling Dways’ Products, despite having said the contrary in her AEIC.

He then became a distributor. On about 29 November 2019, Vivianne informed Neo that her father had passed away and also told him that her father had consumed 12 capsules of HL Span daily. Neo was shocked to hear of her father’s demise and he grew sceptical about the purported health benefits of HL Span. Then on 17 February 2020, Vivianne told him that she was going to seek a refund from Dways for the Products and he also decided to do the same.

Neo’s testimony that he grew sceptical about the alleged health benefits of the Products after the passing of Vivianne’s father was undermined by the fact that he only sought a refund on the Products some three months later when Vivianne informed him that she was going to seek a refund. This is also despite the fact that he had purchased a very substantial amount of Products, namely, Dways’ “platinum package” (being the most expensive package) at $3,000. I disbelieve Neo that he did not seek a refund from Dways immediately upon discovering Vivianne’s father’s death (despite claiming to have then become sceptical of the Products and to have been informed by Vivianne that her father’s death was caused by consuming HL Span) because it was “inconvenient” to do so at that time. I disbelieve that he had to wait for Vivianne as he could only get his refund by going through her as she was his upline. Neo did not explain in his AEIC that he had already wanted to seek a refund but was merely waiting for an opportune time to do so through Vivianne.

The reliability of Ong’s evidence was further called into question by the fact that he was unable to provide a satisfactory answer for why he made no genuine attempt to return the Products and seek a refund, despite claiming to have concerns about them after black spots appeared on HL Span capsules and to have a lot of remaining Products.

</div> Hence this was not a case in which the Chuas were terminated as Dways’ distributors; rather, they chose to stop being involved in Dways. Indeed, Nancy’s concerns turned out to be justified when the CCTV Footages showed the Chuas assisting the Lims to remove Products on 30 January 2020.

</div>
</div>
</div> I find the defence of fair comment is not made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 First, an ordinary reasonable person reading the tone and language of the WhatsApp Messages, 1st Letter and 2nd Letter would have understood that the writer was making factual statements and not merely comments (<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span> at [144]). For instance, in the WhatsApp Messages, Irene categorically claimed that she “[had] been cheated”, that Dways “[had] cheated many people”, and that the Products were made in a country that did not meet the “World Hygiene Standard”. These were not words of opinion but assertions of fact that the Products were unsafe for consumption because they did not meet a specified standard and that Dways had in fact cheated many people. Likewise, the mention in the 1st Letter that distributors were terminated because they discovered Nancy and Zul had misappropriated the proceeds of sale of Products was not a comment but a definitive statement of fact. Irene’s claim in the 2nd Letter that Dways had informed distributors that the Products were manufactured in the USA, Australia or New Zealand, but that they subsequently discovered this to be untrue, was again putting across a factual statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Second, Irene failed to show that many of the statements, assuming they were comments, were based on true facts. For instance, she claimed that she was “Lisa” (which was false) and joined Dways to buy its Products but was cheated. If Irene claimed to have been cheated because <span class="font-italic">she </span>(as “Lisa”) was informed the Products were made in the USA, New Zealand or Australia, then Irene would have known this was not true. She had, even in March 2019, been aware that HL Span and Purity were manufactured in China. She also admitted in court that even when she was still a director of Dways, she was perfectly happy for it to sell products manufactured in China. Irene also knew that B’Glo was manufactured in Malaysia at the material time.

</div> Her claim that the Products were made from a country that did not meet the World Hygiene Standard was also not based on true facts as there was no such standard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Also, the defence of fair comment is defeated by malice. In this regard, I find that Irene did not genuinely believe in what she said. She knew the manufacturing origins of the Products and knew there was no “World Hygiene Standard”. Whilst she explained in court that what she had wanted to say in the WhatsApp Messages was “fair standard”, she admitted that she <span class="font-italic">did</span> intend to type the words “World Hygiene Standard”. At trial, Irene attempted to distance herself from her statements that the <span class="font-italic">country</span> of manufacture was a cause for concern, claiming instead that she was actually concerned about the manufacturing <span class="font-italic">plant</span>.

</div> This showed that Irene did not genuinely believe that the country of manufacture was a cause for concern. In any event, I disbelieve that she had concerns about the manufacturer. The WhatsApp Messages referred in many instances to the manufacturing “country”. Contemporaneous messages showed the Lims were involved in Dways’ operations from the outset, and I reiterate that Irene knew very early on of the origins of the Products and was nevertheless perfectly happy for Dways to sell them.

</div> As late as in December 2019, Irene was explaining to distributors the reason for black spots on the Products and even requested they disseminate the information to their downlines. She had accepted the manufacturer’s explanation that the capsules turned black because of exposure to moisture, and she did not have any concerns then and in fact continued to promote the Products. Additionally, the Lims had in January 2020 brought home a few months’ worth of Products (pursuant to the purported Family Entitlement), which showed that Irene was not genuinely concerned about the safety of the Products for consumption.

This undermined Irene’s case that she became increasingly concerned about the safety of the Products for consumption after knowing of Vivianne’s father’s passing. Although Irene claimed that her concerns were confirmed when the Lims met with Vivianne on 13 February 2020, she agreed there was no proof that Vivianne’s father’s death was caused or contributed to by the Products.
