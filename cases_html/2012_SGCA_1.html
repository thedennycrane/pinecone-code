<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by CDL Properties Ltd
                    (“CDL”) against the decision of the High Court judge (“the
                    Judge”) in <em>CDL Properties Ltd v Chief Assessor and
                        another</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1077 (“the HC Judgment”)
                    affirming the decision of the Valuation Review Board (“the VRB”)
                    to amend the annual values prescribed by the Chief Assessor for 117 units in the
                    development known as “Republic Plaza” located at 9 Raffles
                    Place, Singapore 048619.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first and second respondents (collectively,
                    “the Respondents”) are the Chief Assessor and the Comptroller of
                    Property Tax (“the Comptroller”) respectively. They are different
                    and distinct entities under the Property Tax Act (Cap 254, 2005 Rev
                    Ed) (“the PTA”). The Chief Assessor’s principal functions
                    and duties, in so far as this appeal is concerned, are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     under s 4(2) of the PTA, the
                        Chief Assessor is responsible for assessing the annual values of all
                        “properties” (defined in s 2(1) of the PTA as
                        “includ[ing] houses, buildings, lands and tenements”) for the
                        purposes of the PTA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     under s 10(1) of the PTA, the Chief Assessor is also charged
                        with the duty of preparing a list (referred to in the PTA as the
                        “Valuation List”) containing, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, the annual values of all properties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     under s 11 of the PTA, the Chief
                        Assessor may, at his discretion, either: (i) cause to be prepared a new
                        Valuation List every year, or (ii) adopt the Valuation List then in
                        force, with such alterations and amendments as may have been made from time
                        to time in accordance with the provisions of the PTA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     under s 20(1) of the PTA, the
                        Chief Assessor may amend the Valuation List where it appears that:
                        (i) it is or has become inaccurate in any material particular in any
                        year, or (ii) it is likely to become inaccurate in any material
                        particular in the ensuing year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In respect of a property
                    such as Republic Plaza (<em>ie</em>, a property which is
                    not a wharf, pier, jetty or landing-stage), the term “annual
                    value” is defined in s 2(1) of the PTA as “the gross amount
                    at which the [property] can reasonably be expected to be let from year to year,
                    the landlord paying the expenses of repair, insurance, maintenance or upkeep and
                    all taxes (other than goods and services tax)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As for the Comptroller, he is vested under
                    s 4(1) of the PTA with the responsibility, generally, for carrying out the
                    provisions of the PTA, as well as for collecting property tax and paying it into
                    the Consolidated Fund.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       CDL is the owner of Republic Plaza, which is a
                    large commercial building situated at Raffles Place. Between 6 and 8 June
                    2007, the Chief Assessor, in exercise of his power under s 20(1) of the
                    PTA, issued several notices to inform CDL of his intention to reassess the
                    annual values of the 117 units mentioned at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above (referred to hereafter as “the 117
                    Units”) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     the annual values of 115 of the units
                        (“the 115 Units”) would be amended from $4.20 per square foot
                        per month (“psf/mth”) to $11 psf/mth with effect from
                        1 January 2007; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     the annual values of two of the units (“the 2
                        Units”) would be amended from $4.20 psf/mth to $11 psf/mth
                        with effect from 16 June 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Section 20(1) of the PTA provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where it appears that any Valuation List —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    is or has become
                                inaccurate in any material particular in any year; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    is likely to
                                become inaccurate in any material particular in the ensuing
                                year,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Chief Assessor may, in the year referred to in
                            paragraph (<em>a</em>), if he considers it
                        desirable that an amendment should be made to the Valuation List, give
                        notice thereof to the owner of the property concerned stating the amendment
                        that is considered desirable and the date from which it is proposed the
                        amendment shall take effect, and the amendment shall be made in the
                        Valuation List from that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under s 20A(2) of the PTA, any
                    “owner” (as defined in s 2(1) of the PTA) who desires to
                    object to an amendment made to the Valuation List under s 20 shall make his
                    objection in writing to the Chief Assessor within 21 days of the service of the
                    notice referred to in s 20(1) (the “s 20(1) notice”).
                    Under s 20A(7) of the PTA, any owner dissatisfied with the decision made by
                    the Chief Assessor disallowing his objection (whether in whole or in part) may
                    appeal to the VRB in the manner provided in s 29 of the PTA. Under
                    s 20A(8) of the PTA, where the VRB varies any annual value in the Valuation
                    List in an appeal before it, the Chief Assessor shall cause the Valuation List
                    to be amended in accordance with the decision of the VRB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the present case, each of the s 20(1)
                    notices issued to CDL (collectively, “the Disputed Notices”) was
                    issued in the name of one Ms Ang Sock Tiang (“Ms Ang”),
                    who described herself as “Chief Assessor and Asst Comptroller of Property
                        Tax”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> [capital letters in
                    original omitted]. Each of the Disputed Notices further contained the following
                    statement: “<em>Please note that Property Tax has to be
                        paid even if you have filed an
                        objection/appeal/claim</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> [emphasis
                    added] (“the Notification”). Apropos the Notification, it may be
                    noted that s 35A(1)(<em>d</em>) of the PTA provides
                    that notwithstanding that an objection has been made under s 20A to the
                    Chief Assessor, the owner of the property concerned shall pay “to account
                    of tax in respect of [the] property a sum of money calculated at the prescribed
                    rate of tax on the basis of the annual value in the Valuation List proposed or
                    amended under the provisions of [the PTA]”. CDL paid the property tax
                    outstanding for 2007 that resulted from the Chief Assessor’s proposed
                    amendments to the annual values of the 117 Units, and, after unsuccessfully
                    raising an objection with the Chief Assessor in accordance with the provisions
                    of the PTA, lodged two separate sets of appeals to the VRB (one set in respect
                    of the 115 Units (“the appeals relating to the 115 Units”) and one
                    set in respect of the 2 Units (“the appeals relating to the 2
                    Units”)) under s 20A(7) of the PTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the hearing before the VRB, CDL’s
                    appeals were based on the <em>quantum</em> of the proposed
                    increase in the annual values of the 117 Units, and not on the <em>legality</em> of the Chief Assessor’s proposed action
                    to reassess these units’ annual values and amend the Valuation List for
                    2007 with respect to these units. CDL argued that the Chief Assessor’s
                    amended annual values of $11 psf/mth for the 115 Units with effect from
                    1 January 2007 and $11 psf/mth for the 2 Units with effect from
                    16 June 2007 were excessive, and that the appropriate amended annual values
                    would instead be $7 psf/mth for the 115 Units with effect from
                    1 January 2007 and $9.80 psf/mth for the 2 Units with effect from
                    16 June 2007. In support of its proposal, CDL relied on, <em>inter alia</em>, what was termed the “Market Comparison Method
                    of Valuation” and the existing rent for units in Republic Plaza as
                    reference points (see <em>CDL Properties Ltd v Chief
                        Assessor</em> [2009] SGVRB 1 (“the VRB’s GD”) at
                        [5]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The VRB dismissed the appeals relating to the 2
                    Units (see the VRB’s GD at [26]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In contrast, the VRB allowed the
                    appeals relating to the 115 Units in part by ordering (at [25] of the VRB’s GD)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> that the annual values of
                    those units be set at $7 psf/mth with effect from 1 January 2007 and,
                    thereafter, at $11 psf/mth with effect from the dates of the Disputed
                    Notices (“the Notice Dates”), which, in respect of most of the
                    notices, would be 8 June 2007. The VRB’s reasons for varying the
                    annual values of the 115 Units in this manner were explained in the VRB’s
                    GD as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    Restricting the
                            survey to rental evidence around the period 1 January 2007 to June
                            2007, the [VRB] was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to
                            indicate that rentals had risen to $11 psf/mth by the end of the
                            second quarter of 2007 (i.e. around the date[s] of the [Disputed]
                            Notices):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22.1   Leases in Republic Plaza contracted between
                                May and July 2007 ranged between $10.50 psf/mth and
                                $12.80 psf/mth. The lease at $12.80 psf/mth was a 2-year
                                lease while the lease at $10.50 psf/mth was a 3-year lease. The
                                rental evidence for 2007 shows that rents for 2-year leases were on
                                average higher than rents for 3-year leases.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22.2   The table of Average Grade A Office
                                (Gross) rentals for 2007 compiled by the [Chief Assessor] indicates
                                that average rents for 2Q07 ranged between
                                $11.00–$14.50 psf/mth and for 4Q06 (a proxy for
                                1 January 2007) ranged between $8.73 to
                                $9.10 psf/mth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Although the VRB allowed the appeals relating
                    to the 115 Units in part, it did not award CDL costs against the Chief Assessor
                    with respect to those appeals. Similarly, although CDL failed in the appeals
                    relating to the 2 Units, the VRB did not order CDL to pay the Chief
                    Assessor’s costs for those appeals. The VRB also did not award CDL
                    interest on the amount of overpaid property tax refunded to it with respect to
                    the 115 Units (“the overpaid property tax in respect of the 115
                    Units”) as it did not make the relevant application to the
                VRB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Dissatisfied with the VRB’s decision,
                    CDL appealed to the High Court under s 35(1) of the PTA via Originating
                    Summons No 511 of 2009 naming the Chief Assessor and the Comptroller as the
                    first and second respondents respectively. CDL’s appeal against the
                    VRB’s decision was based predominantly on the argument that the VRB erred
                    in both law and fact in: (a) making the orders set out at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the annual values of the 117 units; (b) not awarding CDL interest on the
                    overpaid property tax in respect of the 115 Units; and (c) not awarding
                    costs to CDL with respect to the appeals relating to the 115
                Units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), the Judge dismissed CDL’s appeal.
                    It is not necessary for us to examine the Judge’s reasons for dismissing
                    CDL’s appeal in so far as: (a) the quantum of the increase in the
                    annual values of the 117 Units and (b) the costs of the appeals relating to
                    the 115 Units are concerned, as CDL is not pursuing these two matters before
                    this court. However, we will consider later the Judge’s reasons for
                    dismissing CDL’s appeal where the issue of interest on the overpaid
                    property tax in respect of the 115 Units is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Given the position taken by CDL in this appeal
                    (see the preceding paragraph), before us, counsel for CDL, Mr Ang Cheng
                    Hock SC (“Mr Ang”), did not challenge that part of the
                    Judge’s decision which upheld the VRB’s decision on the quantum of
                    the revised annual values of the 117 Units and the costs of the appeals relating
                    to the 115 Units. Instead, Mr Ang raised the following issues for
                    determination by this court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Comptroller may
                        immediately recover the increased property tax payable on a property
                        pursuant to a revision of its annual value by the Chief Assessor (as further
                        varied by the VRB, if applicable) in the middle of a calendar year, or
                        whether the increased property tax is recoverable only from 1 January
                        of the following year (“the Tax Recoverability Issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
                        interest should be awarded to CDL on the overpaid property tax in respect of
                        the 115 Units (“the Interest Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We
                    will now discuss these two issues <em>seriatim</em>,
                    beginning with the Tax Recoverability Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Tax Recoverability Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CDL’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     CDL’s argument on the Tax Recoverability
                    Issue is that the scheme of the PTA envisages the payment of property tax on
                    properties contained in the Valuation List in advance for the whole year in
                    January of each year, except in certain instances specified in the PTA.
                    According to CDL, this entails that in the case of the 117 Units, the increased
                    property tax calculated using their revised annual values was payable only in
                    January 2008. This argument is based on s 6 of the PTA, which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Charge of </b>

                                this Act, within one month of the service of that
                            notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Section 6(2) of the PTA, as can be seen
                    from its terms, merely prescribes the time of payment of property tax, and does
                    not empower either the Chief Assessor to impose, or the Comptroller to collect
                    property tax. Specifically, under s 6(2)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the PTA, an owner has to pay property tax in January of each year
                    “without demand” by the Comptroller. Under s 6(2)(<em>b</em>) of the PTA, in cases where the Comptroller serves a
                    notice for payment of property tax on an owner, the owner has to pay within one
                    month of the service of the notice on him. In respect of s 6(2)(<em>a</em>) of the PTA, Mr Ang emphasised that the
                    italicised words in the quotation at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above referred to “tax payable under subsection (1)”,
                        <em>ie</em>, tax “payable at the rate or rates
                    specified in [the PTA] for each year upon the annual value of all houses,
                    buildings, lands and tenements whatsoever included in the Valuation List
                        <em>and amended from time to time in accordance with the
                        provisions of [the </em><em>PTA]</em>”
                    [emphasis added] (see s 6(1) of the PTA). Accordingly, on the premise that
                    the Valuation List for 2007 had been amended to include the <em>revised annual values</em> of the 117 Units, Mr Ang argued
                    before us that CDL should, <em>per</em>
                        s 6(2)(<em>a</em>) of the PTA, be liable to pay
                    the increased property tax on the 117 Units, as calculated based on their
                    revised annual values, only in January 2008 since the PTA did not provide for
                    payment of property tax to be made retrospectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect to the applicability of
                        s 6(2)(<em>b</em>) of the PTA (which <em>ex facie</em> indicated that property tax on the 117 Units
                    based on their revised annual values had to be paid within one month of the
                    service of the Disputed Notices), Mr Ang pointed out that it applied only
                    “where the Comptroller ha[d] served a notice for payment of the tax under
                    [the PTA]” (<em>per</em> s 6(2)(<em>b</em>)), and that the sole provision in the PTA that
                    expressly empowered the Comptroller to issue a notice for payment of property
                    tax was s 22, which provides as follows:</p>

                    needs to be amended, but no action has been taken yet to effect the amendment.
                    These provisions stipulate the applicable annual value based on which property
                    tax is to be calculated in these circumstances, as well as the date from which
                    property tax as thus calculated is payable. In essence, except in a case falling
                    under s 19(8)(<em>a</em>), property tax in these
                    circumstances: (a) is to be paid based on the <em>revised</em> annual value which may be ascribed to the property
                    concerned in a <em>subsequent</em> amended Valuation List;
                    and (b) is payable from the date of the event which necessitates an
                    amendment of that property’s annual value in the Valuation List (<em>eg</em>, the demolition or removal of the whole or part of a
                    building in the case of s 19(8), the construction of a new building in the
                    case of s 21(1), <em>etc</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Ang contended that neither
                    s 19(8) nor the material parts of s 21 of the PTA applied in the
                    present case since the Chief Assessor had already taken steps to amend the
                    Valuation List for 2007; <em>ie</em>, this was not a case
                    where no action had been taken yet to amend the Valuation List even though an
                    amendment was necessary. Accordingly, Mr Ang submitted, the Comptroller
                    could not invoke s 22 of the PTA to issue the Disputed Notices as
                    “notice[s] for payment of [property] tax” for the purposes of
                        s 6(2)(<em>b</em>) of the PTA. Since there was no
                    other provision in the PTA that empowered the Comptroller to issue a notice for
                    the payment of property tax, the Disputed Notices were issued <em>ultra vires</em> and, thus, s 6(2)(<em>b</em>) of the PTA did not apply to require CDL to pay, within one
                    month of the service of those notices, the additional property tax due on the
                    117 Units as a result of the revision of their annual values.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We agree with Mr Ang’s submission
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     section 6(2)(<em>b</em>) of the PTA applies only where the Comptroller has served
                        a notice for payment of property tax (<em>ie</em>,
                        where property tax has become payable to the
                    Comptroller);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Comptroller can invoke s 22 of the PTA to issue such a notice only
                        where property tax is payable under either s 19(8) or s 21;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     neither
                        s 19(8) nor the material parts of s 21 apply on the facts of this
                        case as action has been taken by the Chief Assessor to amend the Valuation
                        List <em>vis-à-vis</em> the 117
                    Units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, our acceptance of the above submission is of
                    no assistance to Mr Ang because the Disputed Notices were not issued
                    pursuant to s 22 of the PTA; <em>ie</em>, they were
                    not notices demanding payment of the additional property tax due on the 117
                    Units as a result of the revision of their annual values (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> below). The Disputed Notices were, instead, merely
                    notifications issued pursuant to s 20(1) (which was expressly referred to
                    in the heading of each of these notices)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> that the annual
                    values of the 117 Units had been increased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondents’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In her reply to Mr Ang’s arguments,
                    Ms Julia Mohamed (“Ms Julia”), counsel for the
                    Respondents, did not dispute that s 6, s 19(8), the material parts of
                    s 21 and s 22 did not apply to the 117 Units. She merely argued that
                    the strict interpretation of these provisions, as advanced by CDL, would not
                    give effect to Parliament’s purpose in enacting the PTA, which was to
                    allow: (a) the Chief Assessor to assess and/or amend annual values as he
                    saw fit, and (b) the Comptroller to collect property tax based on those
                    annual values. Furthermore, Ms Julia contended, if the Comptroller was not
                    able to collect the additional property tax due on a property as a result of a
                    revision of its annual value immediately upon such revision being made by the
                    Chief Assessor, the Chief Assessor’s power under s 20(1) of the PTA
                    to amend the Valuation List (apropos, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the annual value of a property) and decide the date from which the amendment
                    should take effect would be rendered otiose, and it would be pointless to give
                    him this statutory power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Aside from advancing the above commonsensical
                    arguments, Ms Julia was unable to refer us to any provision in the PTA or
                    any case law or judicial statement which could support her arguments. Instead,
                    she invited this court to read s 22 of the PTA in conjunction with
                    s 29(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“the IA”), and imply in favour of the Comptroller the power to
                    issue a notice for the payment of additional property tax resulting from a
                    revision of a property’s annual value so as to enable him to collect the
                    additional property tax. Section 29 of the IA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Construction of enabling words</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>29.</b>—(1) Where a written law
                        confers powers on any person to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing,
                        such powers shall be understood to be also conferred as are reasonably
                        necessary to enable the person to do or enforce the doing of the act or
                        thing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In support of the above submission,
                    Ms Julia relied on the case of <em>Rahimah bte Hussan v
                        Zaine bin Yusoff</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 239, where the High Court
                    held that the then equivalent of s 29 of the IA was applicable to imply in
                    favour of the President of the Syariah Court the ancillary power to execute
                    documents, as well as to give effect to and enforce any order made by him under
                    s 52(3) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3, 1985 Rev
                    Ed) for the disposition and division of matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our view, Ms Julia’s argument
                    based on s 22 of the PTA and s 29 of the IA has two flaws. First, as
                    observed by Mr Ang (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above),
                    s 22 of the PTA empowers the Comptroller to issue notices for the payment
                    of property tax only in cases where property tax is payable under s 19(8)
                    or s 21 of the PTA. As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), CDL’s case does not fall within either of
                    these sections. Second, even if the Comptroller correctly issues a notice for
                    the payment of property tax under s 22, it appears to us that the
                    Comptroller’s power to <em>collect property tax</em>
                    is quite separate from his power to <em>issue the aforesaid
                        notice</em>. The former is premised on property tax being or becoming
                    payable to the Comptroller on any property in the Valuation List (as amended
                    from time to time). Section 4(1) of the PTA merely confers on the
                    Comptroller <em>responsibility</em> for the collection of
                    property tax. Responsibility is not the same as <em>power</em>. As Ms Julia was not able to point to any further
                    provision in the PTA implying a power to collect property tax, s 29 of the
                    IA does not assist her case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the Tax Recoverability Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Preliminary observation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is surprising that such a basic issue as
                    the Tax Recoverability Issue has not been the subject of any discussion or
                    decision by the VRB or any court of law in the 50-odd years that our property
                    tax legislation has been in force. Since 1960 (when the very first predecessor
                    of the PTA (<em>viz</em>, the Property Tax Ordinance 1960
                    (Ord 72 of 1960)) was enacted), the Chief Assessor must have, on countless
                    occasions, revised the annual values of countless properties at different times
                    of the year. Yet, until this appeal, the Chief Assessor has not met with any
                    objection that the additional property tax resulting from such revision would
                    only be payable in January of the ensuing year. That CDL is the only owner to
                    have put forward this argument in the last 50-odd years, during which period (as
                    just mentioned) countless properties must have had their annual values revised,
                    strongly suggests that the argument is unlikely to be correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We make this preliminary observation even
                    though Ms Julia was unable to marshal a coherent rebuttal to
                    Mr Ang’s submissions on the Tax Recoverability Issue. Despite the
                    lack of assistance from Ms Julia’s submissions in this regard, we are
                    satisfied that what we will hereafter term Mr Ang’s “no
                    immediate liability to pay” argument –
                    <em>viz</em>, that except in cases where s 19(8) or
                    any of the material parts of s 21 applies, the additional property tax due
                    on a property as a result of a revision of its annual value is payable only in
                    January of the ensuing year – is wrong. Aside from its inherent
                    implausibility in the context of revenue legislation, we are of the view that
                    the argument is entirely misconceived and has no merit for the reasons set out
                    at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A threshold issue: Appeal incompetent against the
                Comptroller</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     First, however, it is necessary for us to
                    consider the threshold issue (which was not raised by either CDL or the
                    Respondents) of whether the Comptroller was a proper party to the present
                    appeal. In the appeals before the VRB and, subsequently, the appeal before the
                    High Court (which involved the High Court rehearing the appeals before the VRB
                    (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>
                    vol 16 (LexisNexis, 2008 Reissue) at para 200.659)), CDL took
                    issue with the quantum of the increase in the annual values of the 117 Units
                    (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). That issue was concerned solely with whether the
                        <em>Chief Assessor</em>’s assessment of the 117
                    Units’ revised annual values was correct. It had nothing to do with the
                    power of the <em>Comptroller</em> to collect any additional
                    property tax that might arise from the reassessment of these units’ annual
                    values. The terms of the VRB’s order and the VRB’s GD confirm this
                    position. Be that as it may, when CDL appealed to the High Court against the
                    VRB’s decision, it added the Comptroller as a second respondent even
                    though it sought no relief against him. In the HC Judgment, the Judge dealt with
                    only the dispute between CDL and the Chief Assessor. The Judge made no order in
                    relation to the Comptroller’s power to collect from CDL the additional
                    property tax payable on the 117 Units as a result of their revised annual
                    values. In view of this, there could not have been any appealable issue before
                    us as to the Comptroller’s power to collect such tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Although the issue of the Comptroller’s
                    standing in the appeal before the High Court and the present appeal was not
                    taken up by the Comptroller, we are unable to see how this omission can confer
                    on this court jurisdiction to hear an appeal involving the Comptroller when:
                    (a) the proceedings do not concern him, and (b) the High Court has not
                    made any order pertaining to him. This is a basic procedural flaw which cannot
                    be corrected by this court. In our view, this appeal, in so far as it involves
                    the Comptroller as a respondent, is not competent and should be dismissed on
                    that ground alone where the Comptroller is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     There is yet another flaw in CDL’s case
                    on the Tax Recoverability Issue. This issue has been raised because it has an
                    impact on the power (or the lack thereof) of the Comptroller to collect the
                    additional property tax due on the 117 Units as a result of the Chief
                    Assessor’s reassessment of their annual values. However, the
                    Comptroller’s power in this regard does not even arise because the
                    evidence on record shows that the Comptroller neither exercised nor purported to
                    exercise any power to collect the additional property tax from CDL.
                    Mr Ang’s argument, in so far as it was premised on the Disputed
                    Notices having been issued by <em>the Comptroller</em>, is
                    based on a misapprehension of the terms of those notices. Although the Disputed
                    Notices were issued in the name of Ms Ang and although she described
                    herself therein as “Chief Assessor and Asst Comptroller of Property
                        Tax”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> [capital letters in original
                    omitted], they were not issued by her either on behalf of the Comptroller or in
                    her capacity as an Assistant Comptroller. Instead, she issued those notices on
                    behalf of <em>the Chief Assessor</em>. This is evident from
                    s 20(1) of the PTA (the provision pursuant to which the Disputed Notices
                    were issued), which makes it clear that the issuing of s 20(1) notices
                    falls under the purview of <em>the Chief Assessor</em>, and
                        <em>not</em> the Comptroller. The reference to
                    Ms Ang as “Chief Assessor and Asst Comptroller of Property
                        Tax”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> [capital letters in
                    original omitted] in each of the Disputed Notices was merely intended to
                    describe her departmental title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Furthermore, Mr Ang appears to have read
                    – wrongly – the Notification in each of the Disputed Notices
                    (reproduced at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above) as if it were a
                    notice of demand for payment of property tax. The Notification did not have such
                    a legal effect. It was, instead, merely a notification or reminder to CDL that
                    property tax based on the revised annual values of the 117 Units was payable
                    even if CDL intended to object to the revision (in this regard, see also
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). The position stated in the
                    Notification is in line with s 35A of the PTA (discussed later at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>–<a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> below). In short, Mr Ang’s reading of the
                    Notification has no factual basis and is purely academic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Ang’s “no immediate liability to pay”
                argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We turn now to the merits of
                    Mr Ang’s “no immediate liability to pay” argument,
                    which lies at the heart of CDL’s case on the Tax Recoverability Issue.
                    Although, consequent upon our ruling at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above, it is
                    not necessary for us to deal with this argument, we nevertheless think it is
                    desirable that we clarify the duties and functions of the Comptroller in
                    relation to the recoverability of additional property tax arising from a
                    revision of a property’s annual value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We preface our discussion of this issue by
                    observing that it is simply not conceivable that there could have been a lacuna
                    in the law for such a long period of time on the immediate recoverability of
                    additional property tax due on a property pursuant to a reassessment of its
                    annual value (as Mr Ang’s “no immediate liability to
                    pay” argument suggests) without Parliament rectifying the position by
                    enacting the appropriate legislation. If this lacuna (assuming it does exist)
                    has indeed hitherto been left unaddressed, it would mean that the Property Tax
                    Department of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“the Property
                    Tax Department”) has had to defer the collection of millions of dollars
                    in property tax. Furthermore, if Mr Ang’s “no immediate
                    liability to pay” argument is correct (<em>viz</em>,
                    if the additional property tax arising from a reassessment of a property’s
                    annual value is indeed payable only in January of the ensuing year), Parliament
                    would have acted in vain in setting up a legislative framework that includes the
                    conferment of the following rights and powers:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     the power of the Chief Assessor to
                        reassess the annual value of a property (as stated in the Valuation List) at
                        any time when the Valuation List becomes or is likely to become inaccurate
                        in this regard (see s 20(1) of the PTA);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     the right of an owner affected by a reassessment
                        of his property’s annual value to lodge an objection with the Chief
                        Assessor on the reassessment (see s 20A(1) of the
                    PTA);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     the right of
                        an affected owner to appeal to the VRB against the Chief Assessor’s
                        decision disallowing his objection (see s 20A(7) of the PTA);
                        and</p>
<p>(d)the power of the VRB, after hearing an
                        appeal before it, to “direct that such amendments as it thinks proper
                        shall be made to the Valuation List for the year in respect of which the
                        appeal was made and for the ensuing years” (see
                            s 33(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    PTA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the viewpoint of financial efficiency, and the
                    Property Tax Department cannot be short of it, Ms Julia is certainly spot
                    on in arguing that the aforementioned elaborate legislative structure would be
                    pointless if Mr Ang’s “no immediate liability to pay”
                    argument is correct. In the present case, the VRB: (a) upheld the Chief
                    Assessor’s decision to increase the annual values of the 2 Units to
                    $11 psf/mth with effect from 16 June 2007; and (b) varied the
                    Chief Assessor’s decision with respect to the 115 Units to the extent that
                    the annual value of $11 psf/mth for each of these units would take effect
                    only from the Notice Dates, all of which fell in the month of June 2007. The
                    VRB’s decision would be completely meaningless if the resultant
                    outstanding property tax due in respect of the 117 Units for 2007 were payable
                    by CDL <em>not</em> in 2007 itself, but only in January of
                    the ensuing year (<em>viz</em>, 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In our view, Mr Ang’s “no
                    immediate liability to pay” argument is based on a misapprehension of the
                    provisions of the PTA. Under the PTA, when the annual value of a property is
                    reassessed by the Chief Assessor, any additional property tax resulting from the
                    reassessment is payable by the owner to the Comptroller <em>without demand or notice</em>. This is made clear by s 35A of
                    the PTA, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Tax to be paid notwithstanding objection,
                            etc.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35A.—(1) There shall be payable to account of tax
                        in respect of a property a sum of money calculated at the prescribed rate of
                        tax on the basis of the annual value in the Valuation List proposed or
                        amended under the provisions of this Act notwithstanding
                        that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    an objection or
                                appeal has been made under section 20A …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The sum under subsection (1) shall be payable
                            and recoverable in the same manner in which taxes are payable and
                            recoverable under this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is clear from the terms of s 35A of
                    the PTA that this section is intended to be and operates as a tax imposition and
                    recoverability provision. Where the Valuation List is amended during a calendar
                    year apropos a property’s annual value (as was done in the present case),
                    the owner is under an obligation, upon receiving a s 20(1) notice, to pay
                    to the Comptroller any outstanding amount of property tax “calculated at
                    the prescribed rate of tax on the basis of the annual value in the Valuation
                    List …
                    <em>amended</em> under the provisions of [the PTA]”
                    [emphasis added] (see s 35A(1)), regardless of whether he makes an
                    objection (to the Chief Assessor) or appeals (to the VRB) under s 20A. The
                    owner’s liability is not conditional upon a demand by or a notice to pay
                    from the Comptroller. In the present case, if CDL had failed to pay the
                    additional property tax due in respect of the 117 Units, the Comptroller would
                    have been able to recover such tax under s 35A(2) using the means provided
                    in s 38A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the event that the owner succeeds in his
                    appeal to the VRB and the VRB revises the property’s annual value in the
                    Valuation List in his favour, s 33(4) of the PTA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where under subsection (1) the [VRB] directs such amendments as it
                        thinks proper to be made to the Valuation List and the tax in respect of the
                        property concerned is less than the amount paid by the [owner] to account of
                        tax in respect of that property, the [VRB] may order the Comptroller to pay
                        interest, from the date the decision of the [VRB] is first pronounced, at
                        such rate as may be prescribed on the difference between the amount paid to
                        account of tax and the tax payable in respect of that property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision makes it clear that if an owner succeeds in his appeal
                    to the VRB, he is entitled to a refund of the excess property tax that he paid
                    to the Comptroller prior to the appeal. Hence, what is “payable to
                    account of tax” pursuant to s 35A(1) of the PTA is payable <em>qua</em> property tax, and not <em>qua</em> security for the amount of property tax that will finally be
                    determined by the VRB on appeal. As the Comptroller does not have to take any
                    steps to collect the additional property tax due on a property as a result of a
                    revision of its annual value, the issue of whether he may collect the additional
                    property tax immediately or whether he has to wait until January of the ensuing
                    year to do so –
                    <em>viz</em>, the Tax Recoverability Issue – is
                    wholly irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Interest Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We turn now to the Interest Issue. Before us,
                    CDL argued that the Judge was wrong in refusing to award interest on the
                    overpaid property tax in respect of the 115 Units, which overpayment resulted
                    from the VRB’s decision to reduce the annual values of the 115 Units from
                    $11 psf/mth (as decided by the Chief Assessor) to $7 psf/mth for the
                    period from 1 January 2007 to the Notice Dates (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). Whether or not interest should be awarded on
                    overpaid property tax is a matter of discretion for the VRB (see s 33(4) of
                    the PTA), which discretion must be exercised judiciously. In the present case,
                    the VRB did not award any interest on the overpaid property tax in respect of
                    the 115 Units on the grounds that it was unable to make any decision on the
                    matter as CDL did not ask for such interest (see [27] of the VRB’s GD).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On appeal by CDL to the High Court, the Judge
                    dismissed CDL’s appeal where interest on the overpaid property tax in
                    respect of the 115 Units was concerned on the grounds that the VRB had exercised
                    its discretion reasonably in not awarding interest (see [26] of the HC Judgment). With respect, we
                    disagree with the Judge’s reasoning. The question of the VRB exercising
                    its discretion as to whether or not to award CDL interest on the overpaid
                    property tax in respect of the 115 Units did not arise. As stated in the
                    VRB’s GD, the VRB did not consider whether or not to award such interest
                    to CDL because CDL did not ask for it. Whether or not the VRB’s approach
                    was correct is not relevant in the present appeal. The fact was that the VRB
                        <em>did not</em> exercise its discretion. In the
                    circumstances, the Judge was entitled to deal with the issue of interest on the
                    merits since s 33(4) of the PTA does not make it a requirement for an owner
                    to apply to the VRB for interest on overpaid property tax before such interest
                    can be awarded (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Chief
                        Assessor and another v Keppel Corp Ltd</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 457,
                    where the High Court awarded the owner interest on overpaid property tax even
                    though the VRB did not deal with that issue and even though the owner did not,
                    in its appeal to the High Court, challenge the VRB’s decision on this
                    point). The issue of interest on the overpaid property tax in respect of the 115
                    Units was thus within the discretion of the Judge to decide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In our view, the Respondents have not given
                    any reason why it would not be fair for CDL to be awarded interest on the
                    overpaid property tax in respect of the 115 Units. Accordingly, we order
                    interest to be paid at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of CDL’s
                    payment of the aforesaid property tax to the Comptroller up to the date of the
                    Comptroller’s repayment of the same to CDL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the above reasons, we make the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     This appeal is dismissed in so far
                        as the Tax Recoverability Issue is concerned. We agree with the
                        Judge’s decision affirming the VRB’s ruling on the amendments to
                        the Valuation List with respect to the 117 Units.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     This appeal is allowed in so far as
                        the Interest Issue is concerned. We set aside the Judge’s decision not
                        to award CDL interest on the overpaid property tax in respect of the 115
                        Units, and award CDL interest at the rate and for the period stipulated at
                            <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     CDL will be entitled to its costs here
                        and below on the Interest Issue. However, there will be no costs on the Tax
                        Recoverability Issue as we received no assistance from counsel for the
                        respective parties in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     The usual consequential orders will
                apply.</p>
