<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In these proceedings, Eco Special Waste
                    Management Pte Ltd (“Eco SWM”) and Eco Resource Recovery Centre
                    Pte Ltd (“Eco RRC”), the Defendants in the consolidated main
                    actions brought against them by the Plaintiff, Bing Integrated Construction Pte
                    Ltd (“Bing Integrated”), instituted third party actions against
                    the estate of the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party, Colonel Chua Tiong
                    Guan (“Colonel Chua”) and Chua Chin Giap, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party. At the hearing of the
                    Plaintiff’s actions, the Defendants withdrew their counterclaims against
                    Bing Integrated as well as their claims against the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party. However, they continued their
                    claims against the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party. This judgment is
                    in relation to the Defendants’ claims in Suit No 605 of 2006/X and
                    Suit No 606 of 2006/B against the 1<sup>st</sup> Third
                    Party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Defendants alleged, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that Colonel Chua breached his fiduciary duties as their
                    director by acting fraudulently against their interest and in favour of Bing
                    Integrated and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party, and that Colonel
                    Chua unlawfully conspired with them to injure or cause loss to the
                        Defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Defendants thus claimed for an
                    indemnity from the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party against all claims
                    brought by Bing Integrated against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Defendants are subsidiary companies of ECO
                    Industrial Environmental Engineering Pte Ltd (“ECO IEE”) and they
                    are in the business of waste management and recycling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> ECO IEE was incorporated on 30 December
                    1995 with 3 shareholders, namely Tan Keow Chong (“KC Tan”), Goh
                    Seng Nam (“Goh SN”) and Colonel Chua. The three of them held one
                    share each in ECO IEE at the time of incorporation and all three were
                        directors,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> with Colonel Chua being the Managing
                    Director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Colonel Chua was the elder brother of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party, who is the majority shareholder
                    and effective owner of Bing Integrated. Eco RRC was incorporated on 28 May
                    1997 and Eco SWM was incorporated on 14 July 1997.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The shareholdings of ECO IEE changed over time
                    pursuant to new members of the company being added and restructuring exercises.
                    At the material time in July 1996, the shareholders were:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chua Bing</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chua Kim Hua</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Colonel Chua</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Goh SN</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     James Ow</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     James Traazil</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a>(g)     KC Tan</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_h"></a>(h)     Wong TY</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a>(i)     Wang Zhaoyong</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At that time, Chua Kim
                    Hua (“Chua KH”) was the Chairman of ECO IEE. KC Tan was the
                    vice-Chairman of ECO IEE and as mentioned, Colonel Chua was the managing
                    director. The company secretary was Liew Keng Loong. I should point out that
                    Chua KH is not related to Colonel Chua and Chua Bing is the elder brother of
                    Colonel Chua. However, nothing in these proceedings turned on Colonel
                    Chua’s relationship with Chua Bing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 9 July 1996, Colonel Chua sent out a
                    notice to the shareholders of ECO IEE calling for an extraordinary
                    shareholders’ meeting to be held on the next day (the “EGM
                    notice”) for the purpose of discussing, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the issue of the “methodology in handling the
                    factory construction”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The shareholders’ meeting on 10 July
                    1996 (the “10 July 1996 meeting”) was the crucial event
                    forming the bedrock of the Defendants’ claims against Colonel Chua. The
                    Defendants alleged that the shareholders of ECO IEE decided at the 10 July
                    1996 meeting that the proposed development of the factory plants to carry out
                    their waste management and recycling business was to be constructed on a
                    “cost plus” basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Further, as the managing director of ECO IEE,
                    Colonel Chua assumed responsibility for the proposed developments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Due to a land re-zoning development by Jurong
                    Town Corporation (“JTC”), ECO IEE could not proceed with its
                    initial plan to carry out both hazardous and non-hazardous waste management on
                    the same plot of land. Thus it had to acquire another plot of land so that the
                    hazardous and non-hazardous activity could be carried out on the respective
                    zoned land. ECO IEE then decided to incorporate two subsidiary companies,
                        <em>i.e</em>. the Defendants, to manage the different
                    aspects of ECO IEE’s business, with Eco SWM managing the hazardous waste
                    business and Eco RRC managing the non-hazardous waste business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In addition, in order to ascertain how the waste
                    processes would work, it was decided by the shareholders that a temporary shed
                    for trial operations should be constructed first. This would allow them to
                    understand how to design and construct the main plant for the Eco RRC
                        project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In this regard, KC Tan (testifying for
                    the Defendants) relied on a letter of award dated 6 June 1997
                    (“6 June 1997 LOA”), which presumably was the contract
                    awarded for the construction of the temporary shed. The 6 June 1997 LOA
                    stated in clause 1 that the temporary shed would be constructed on a cost plus
                        basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Defendants alleged that
                    by awarding the construction of the temporary shed on a cost plus basis, the
                    shareholders of ECO IEE had agreed to construct the factory plants on a cost
                    plus basis. On the other hand, the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party
                    relied on a letter of award dated 15 April 1997 (“15 April 1997
                    LOA”) to show that the temporary shed was constructed on a measurement
                        basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 3 November 1997, Eco SWM awarded the
                    main contract to Bing Integrated to erect a factory at Lot 2158PT SL (2258) MK 7
                    at Tuas South Avenue 3.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Similarly, on
                    19 November 1997, Eco RRC employed Bing Construction to erect a factory at
                    Lots 2497A and 2498K (Plot Al7477) MK 7 at Tuas West Road/Tuas Avenue
                        20.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The 3 November 1997 and 19
                    November 1997 contracts shall collectively be referred to as the “Main
                    Contracts”. The Main Contracts incorporated the 1997 Edition of the
                    Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Measurement Contract) issued by
                    the Singapore Institute of Architects. The architect for both of the Main
                    Contracts was Ms Tan Meow Hwa of M/s AC Partnership
                    (“Ms Tan”) who was subpoenaed by the Defendants to give
                    evidence in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Defendants alleged that the shareholders
                    of the Defendants<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> were not given copies of the
                    Main Contracts and that prior to the awards, Colonel Chua orally informed KC Tan
                    and Goh SN that Bing Integrated would be the main contractor and would charge
                    the Defendants on a “cost plus” basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> By
                    awarding the Main Contracts on a measurement basis with Bing Integrated, Colonel
                    Chua had caused the Defendants to incur higher costs than that which would have
                    been incurred if the Main Contracts had been awarded on a cost plus
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     To establish their claims, the Defendants
                    relied on the EGM notice, the minutes of the 10 July 1996 meeting as well
                    as the 6 June 1997 LOA. KC Tan, Goh SN and Wong TY were also called to give
                    evidence to support the Defendants’ claim that an agreement was reached
                    during the 10 July 1996 meeting that the Main Contracts would be awarded on
                    a cost plus basis. The witnesses, in particular, KC Tan, stated repeatedly that
                    they trusted Colonel Chua to manage the Defendants but in breach of this trust,
                    Colonel Chua had preferred the interests of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Third Party by awarding the Main Contracts to Bing Integrated on a measurement
                    basis instead of a cost plus basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The particulars of the Defendants’
                    pleadings were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2(h)  Sometime in 1997,
                            the Defendant wanted to erect buildings on Lot 2158T SL (2158) ML 7 at
                            Tuas South Avenue 3 (“the Project”). The
                                1<sup>st</sup> Third Party acting on behalf of the
                            Defendant was responsible for the
                            Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2(i)  The
                                1<sup>st</sup> Third Party had orally informed the
                            other directors of the Defendant that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            Third Party owned a construction company, namely the Plaintiff. The
                                1<sup>st</sup> Third Party also orally informed the
                            other directors of the Defendant that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The Plaintiff would be willing to be the main
                                contractor for the Project and would charge the Defendants on a
                                “cost plus” basis (i.e. cost of construction PLUS
                                fixed amount and/or a fixed percentage of the costs of the
                                construction <em>to be agreed</em> as profit);
                                and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   A “cost plus” basis contract
                                would be cheaper than calling for a tender for the Project on a
                                traditional costing basis, i.e. remeasurement or lump sum;
                                and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   Under such a contract, the Plaintiff would
                                obtain the best quotes for supplies, services and all other items
                                needed under the contract and present the quotes to the Defendants
                                together with a mark-up as a fee (i.e. the “cost
                                plus”) <em>to be agreed</em> as between
                                the Plaintiff and the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Paragraph 2(i) of the statement of claim
                    merely stated that the “plus” element was “to be
                    agreed”, which suggests that no firm figure or markup percentage had in
                    fact been agreed upon as at the 10 July 1996 meeting or at any later time.
                    There is also no mention in [2(i)] either that there was an agreement to use the
                    market norm figure for the markup percentage, which according to the Defendants
                    was between 3 to 5% at that period of time. I note at this point that KC
                    Tan’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) filed on
                    29 December 2009 provided at [15] that the shareholders agreed at the
                    10 July 1996 meeting that the cost plus basis would be used and what was
                        <em>meant</em> as cost plus at the meeting was that
                    “if the percentage was not agreed upon it would have followed the market
                    norm, which [he] understood to be 3 to 5% at that time.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I will
                    refer to this part of his AEIC at a later part of this judgment (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> below). It would appear that it was KC
                    Tan’s own understanding of the meaning of “cost plus” and
                    not that the members at the 10 July 1996 meeting had further resolved or
                    agreed that in the event that the markup percentage for the “cost
                    plus” could not be agreed, then the market norm was to be used and the
                    actual markup percentage to be adopted had to fall within the established range
                    of 3 to 5% for the market norm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In their statement of claim against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Third Party, the Defendants further alleged
                    that throughout the course of the Main Contracts, up till his termination as a
                    director of both ECO IEE and the Defendants, Colonel Chua was solely in charge
                    of determining when and how much payment was made by the Defendants to Bing
                    Integrated and that he had made excessive and unauthorised payments to Bing
                    Integrated, in contravention of the terms of the Main Contracts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In the main hearing, I noted that
                    the complaint was not that Bing Integrated was paid excessively or overpaid for
                    the construction of the factory plants, but that payments to Bing Integrated
                    were allegedly made before the architect’s interim certificates were
                    issued. In fact, Mr Gabriel accepted that Bing Integrated “did the
                    job” and “is to be paid”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> For greater clarity, I shall
                    refer to this head of claim as the “early payment claim”
                    instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the other hand, in his defence, Colonel
                    Chua averred that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>

                            (Amendment No. 1) are denied. The directors to the Defendant knew one
                            another and were aware on their own that the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party owned the Plaintiff. The
                            Defendant engaged the Plaintiff as the main contractor with full
                            knowledge of the board of directors of the Defendant and the
                            shareholders. The directors of the Defendant were at all material times
                            fully aware of the terms of the contract to be entered with the
                            Plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party will say that
                            it was Tan Keaw Chong (“KC Tan”), the chairman of ECO
                            Industrial Environment Engineering Pte Ltd (“ECO IEE”) and
                            also a director of the Defendant who was the prime mover of the contract
                            between the Plaintiff and Defendant. It was also understood that the
                            Defendant would employ as sub-contractors companies which were owned by
                            other directors of the Defendant or companies in which they had
                            interests in.</p>

                            Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) the Defendant was aware at all
                            times of the payments made as alleged and the reasons for the same. It
                            is denied that the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party had made
                            or caused to be made or procured the Defendant to make payments to the
                            Plaintiffs without any basis. It is denied that there was any excessive
                            and/or authorised payments made to the Plaintiff as alleged and the
                            Defendant is to put to strict proof of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In essence, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Third Party’s case was that there was no agreement that the Main Contracts
                    were to be awarded on a cost plus basis at the 10 July 1996 meeting. I note
                    that this 10 July 1996 meeting was not a meeting of the shareholders or
                    board of directors of the Defendants as the Defendants were not yet incorporated
                    as of the date of this meeting, but it was an extraordinary general meeting of
                    the shareholders of ECO IEE. It was thus very early days yet in so far as these
                    two waste management and recycling projects were concerned. All that had
                    transpired was a discussion on the methodology to be employed without any firm
                        decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    With regard to the claim of unauthorised and excessive payment, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Third Party averred that the Main Contracts
                    were undertaken with a high degree of informality and payments to Bing
                    Integrated were made with the directors’ knowledge and
                authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Subsequently, on 8 October 2004, Colonel
                    Chua was removed from his office as the managing director of ECO IEE. He passed
                    away before filing an AEIC for the trial. KC Tan is currently the managing
                    director of ECO IEE.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence at trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Before I consider the evidence, I note that
                    the relevant events happened more than 10 years from the commencement of these
                    proceedings. In this regard, the recent Court of Appeal decision of <em>Ng Chee Chuan v Ng Ai Tee (administratrix of the estate of Yap Yoon
                        Moi, deceased)</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 918 (“<em>Ng Chee Chuan</em>”) is instructive. Chao JA
                    compared the relative evidentiary value of contemporaneous documents with oral
                    testimony and stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    While it is no doubt necessary to ascertain the
                            credibility of witnesses in most cases where the oral evidence of the
                            parties conflict, it is not always appropriate to rely primarily on
                            credibility (determined on the basis of inconsistent testimony) as a
                            basis for drawing factual inferences, especially where the events in
                            question have taken place many years ago and there are undisputed
                            objective facts. Imperfect memories and uncertain recollections should
                            not necessarily be treated as impinging on the credibility of a witness.
                            These are but afflictions which the passage of time will, in varying
                            degree, bring to bear on all individuals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    In this case, the question of the credibility of
                            witnesses should have played a smaller role in the overall assessment as
                            to where the truth lay given the presence of contemporaneous documents
                            and undisputed facts. The trial judge, in our view, should have drawn
                            inferences from these pieces of objective evidence instead of reaching
                            conclusions influenced heavily by what was believed to be the
                            credibility of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    As we perceived it, the availability of
                            contemporaneous documents in this case reduced the need to rely on the
                            testimony of the witnesses on the stand as much of the evidence was, in
                            fact, not disputed... The crucial question of whether the oral agreement
                            alleged by the respondent existed depended as much, if not more, on the
                            inferences which could reasonably be drawn from the available objective
                            evidence than the apparent credibility of the witnesses per
                        se...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    We appreciated that the trial judge had considered
                            the facts extensively, and also had the occasion to observe the
                            demeanour of the witnesses at trial. We did not have this benefit.
                            However, given the nature of the case, and the objective evidence on
                            record, we were persuaded that the trial judge had put excessive
                            emphasis on the credibility of the witnesses, when greater reliance
                            should have been placed on the contemporaneous documents and objective
                            facts. It was the inherent probabilities, in the light of the objective
                            evidence, that should have been decisive. With a lapse of some 14 years
                            between the date of the executions of the deeds and the commencement of
                            the trial, it was hardly surprising that memories would fade. In the
                            circumstances, we were convinced that we were in as good a position as
                            the trial judge to draw the necessary inferences from the objective
                            facts...</p>

                    importance of the minutes of the 10 July 1996 meeting, and that this
                    document, together with the EGM notice and the 6 June 1997 LOA, “must be

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The EGM notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The relevant portion of the EGM notice sent by
                    Colonel Chua to the shareholders of ECO IEE stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">AGENDA FOR BOARD MEETING ON 10 JULY 96 AT 1500HRS</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Their [<em>sic</em>] is a need
                            to have the ad hoc meeting to discuss on the final proposal submitted by
                            the various suppliers on incinerator construction and also other
                            relevant issues. The meeting will be held on 10 July ’96 at
                            1500 hrs in the conference room. The agenda for the meeting is as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">n.    Methodology in handling factory
                            construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As can be seen, it is unclear from the EGM
                    notice whether the 10 July 1996 meeting in fact turned out to be a
                    shareholders’ meeting or a board meeting (as the agenda enclosed in the
                    EGM notice apparently was for a board meeting). However, nothing in these
                    proceedings turns upon this ambiguity. On the EGM notice, there is a handwritten
                    note beside para 1(n) of the notice which says “on percentage”.
                    These words were presumably written by Colonel Chua (counsel for the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Third Party, Mr Tan, did not dispute
                    this point).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The Defendants submitted that by this notation,
                    Colonel Chua acknowledged at the 10 July 1996 meeting that it was agreed by
                    all present that the construction was to be carried out on a cost plus basis. KC
                    Tan stated in his AEIC that he believed that Colonel Chua had inserted the
                    notation at or after the 10 July 1996 meeting<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and this showed
                    that he acknowledged that the construction would have to be carried out on a
                    cost plus basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In my view, the simple notation of “on
                    percentage” beside the sentence “methodology in handling factory
                    construction” does not show that there was an agreement reached to
                    construct the factory plants on a cost plus basis. First, it is unclear whether
                    that notation was written prior to, during or at the conclusion of the
                    discussion on the “methodology in handling factory construction”.
                    Second, it is not exactly clear what “on percentage” means. KC
                    Tan’s belief is just an assertion unsupported by any personal knowledge on
                    the matter. Even if “on percentage” was indeed written in
                    reference to the cost plus basis, the highest that the Defendants can pitch is
                    that the notation shows that the cost plus basis would be or was discussed
                    during the 10 July 1996 meeting. Without more, the EGM notice with the
                    notation “on percentage” is insufficient to prove that those
                    present at the meeting had in fact <em>agreed</em> to enter
                    into the Main Contracts only on a cost plus basis and on no other
                basis.</p>

                    minutes of the 10 July 1996 meeting of ECO IEE, the material part of which
                    provided that:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.1    Mr Chua <em>mentioned</em> on the cost-plus method. He <em>said</em> that for the cost-plus method, we can open an

                            in design, we will meet with the problem of price negotiation.
                            Mr Chua <em>mentioned</em> that ECO can ask
                            Col (NS) Chua’s brother to open an account in his company and then
                            work out the cost-plus method from there. Col (NS) Chua <em>said</em> that the quality of the construction will
                            be assured through one person. Mr Ow <em>said</em> that we need a reliable person to tend to the
                            cost-plus method. Mr Goh <em>said</em> that
                            Col (NS) Chua’s brother has the experience and is reliable.
                            Mr Chua <em>said</em> that through tender, it
                            is time-consuming as we have to negotiate the pricing. He <em>said</em> that the cost-plus method will save us 1 to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The “Mr Chua” mentioned
                    above refers to Chua KH and not to Colonel Chua. The minutes of the 10 July
                    1996 meeting only recorded a <em>discussion</em> about the
                    advantages of the cost plus basis <em>e.g</em>. the quality
                    assurance and possible savings of $1 to $2 million. The meeting also touched on
                    the disadvantages of awarding the Main Contracts by a tender process. The
                    minutes as drafted only recorded what was “said” or
                    “mentioned” and there was nothing recorded on what was
                    “decided”, “agreed” or “approved”.
                    More importantly, there was no record of any resolution passed to the effect
                    that the board of directors and/or the shareholders had <em>agreed</em>, <em>decided</em>, <em>approved</em> or <em>resolved</em> that
                    the Main Contracts would be awarded only on a cost plus basis and on no other
                    basis. This omission is, in my view, glaring. The company secretary would have
                    recorded such an agreement as alleged by the Defendants if there had been one.
                    In minute writing, the most important matters to record would normally be the
                    agreements reached and the decisions made at the meeting and much less so, the
                    contents of the actual discussion which may or may not eventually lead to an
                    agreement or a decision. I find it hard to accept that the secretary who had
                    meticulously recorded the contents of the discussion in the minutes would have
                    left out recording such an important matter as an agreement that had been
                    reached as alleged by the Defendants, unless of course no such agreement was in
                    fact reached at the conclusion of the discussion. On the basis of the minutes,
                    which as submitted by the Defendants ought to be given “full
                    weight”, there is insufficient proof in my view of an agreement or a
                    decision to enter into the Main Contracts solely on a cost plus
                basis.</p>

                    made a decision to grant the Main Contracts on a cost plus basis because it

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     KC Tan’s AEIC at [15] merely stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was clear that what was meant as “cost plus” in the
                        meeting was that the contractor was to be paid a percentage of the cost, if
                        that percentage was not agreed upon it would have followed the market norm,
                        which I understood it to be 3-5 per cent at that time. This fact of a
                        percentage to be paid was specifically noted by the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Third Party in his letter of
                            9<sup>th</sup> July 1996 (ie on the agenda for the
                        meeting). The notation “on percentage” was handwritten by the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Third Party against Item (n)
                        “Methodology in handling factory contract”. I believe he had
                        inserted this notation at or after the meeting. Thus by this notation the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Third Party himself acknowledged that the
                        construction was to be carried out on a “cost-plus” basis.
                        Further the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party’s knowledge of
                        the agreement on the cost-plus basis is confirmed from the said minutes of
                        the meeting where he stated that “the quality of the construction
                        will be assured through one person.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     KC Tan’s AEIC clearly contained nothing
                    about a discussion about the percentage of the “plus” element,
                    much less an agreement to follow the market norm for the “plus”
                    element. What was stated was KC Tan’s own understanding of the meaning of
                    “cost plus” that “if the percentage was not agreed upon it
                    would have followed the market norm” (a point which I have already
                    alluded to above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>). This only meant
                    that if no figure was agreed upon, KC Tan himself understood that the market
                    norm would be adopted, not that there was an agreement by all those present at
                    the meeting that the market norm was to be followed if no agreement could be
                    reached on the actual markup percentage. He tried to explain that [15] of his
                    AEIC did not describe what happened at the 10 July 1996 meeting<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and that in
                    fact, the shareholders had said that they would follow market norm and the
                    percentage was 3 to 5%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I am unable to accept this explanation. The
                    AEIC was drafted with legal advice and the 10 July 1996 meeting is the
                    single most important event upon which the Defendants’ case rests. With
                    the absence of any documentary record of the discussion of the percentage markup
                    and the outcome, if any, of that discussion during the meeting, it would have
                    been of greater significance for KC Tan to deal with the omission in his AEIC.
                    Yet he chose not to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     What was in evidence is Wong TY’s
                    testimony that KC Tan had stated at the 10 July 1996 meeting that the
                    “plus” element would be 5 to 10%. However, KC Tan only testified
                    that he questioned Chua KH on why the construction should be “cost plus
                    but not something else”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and that his <em>understanding</em> was that the percentage would be the market norm
                        <em>i.e</em>. 3 to 5%. There was no evidence, either
                    from KC Tan’s AEIC or his oral testimony in court, that KC Tan had
                    personally proposed any particular figure for the “plus” element
                    during the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I acknowledge that the passage of time would
                    inevitably lead to the fading of memories. But faced with these inconsistent
                    accounts by the Defendants’ principal witnesses about the events that
                    transpired at the 10 July 1996 meeting, I am hard-pressed to find as a fact
                    that there was an agreement or a mandate granted to Colonel Chua to award the
                    Main Contracts only on a cost plus basis (and on no other basis), especially in
                    the face of contemporaneous documents which undermine their own case. In my
                    judgment, the minutes of the 10 July 1996 meeting merely disclosed a
                        <em>discussion</em> of the methodology to be employed.
                    The reliance by the Defendants on this document, rather than aiding their case,
                    only served to suggest that during that meeting, no agreement was eventually
                    reached on the issue at the end of the <em>discussion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 6 June 1997 LOA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The other documentary evidence referred to
                    during trial was the 6 June 1997 LOA (see above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) which allegedly showed that the position taken by the
                    shareholders in the 10 July 1996 meeting was carried out by Colonel Chua
                    for the start of the construction projects.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> KC Tan’s AEIC stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was decided that a temporary shed for trial operations should be

                        Project. The construction of the temporary shed for trial operations was
                        awarded to the Plaintiff on a “cost-plus” basis. This is
                        evidenced by the letter of award dated 6 June 1997 signed by the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Third Party and duly accepted by the
                        Plaintiff...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     However, during cross-examination, Mr Tan
                    referred to another document, the 15 April 1997 LOA (see above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). The 15 April 1997 LOA was purportedly awarded
                    by AC Partnership on ECO IEE’s behalf to Bing Integrated to construct the
                    temporary shed on a measurement basis. Clause 2 of the 15 April 1997 LOA

                    or the 15 April 1997 LOA was the operative or “real” contract for
                    the construction of the temporary shed. He understandably said that the 6 June
                    1997 LOA was the one that he relied upon and that it was the
                    “real” contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     When asked to provide the basis for his
                    opinion, KC Tan referred to a progress payment claim from Bing Integrated for
                    the construction of the temporary shed where it was stated that the
                    “profit attendance” was 3%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> KC Tan claimed that this reflected

                    only document relied upon to establish that the “plus” element for
                    the Main Contracts was agreed between Colonel Chua and Bing Integrated (and the

                    admitted that he was not present when they allegedly made the agreement and he
                    had no personal knowledge of the agreement. Apart from being based on KC
                    Tan’s unsupported opinion, this evidence went against his own case that
                    there was no agreed fixed number for the “plus”

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Whether the 6 June 1997 LOA or the 15 April
                    1997 LOA was the operative contract for the temporary shed, in my view, does not
                    matter. KC Tan conceded that it was just his <em>assumption</em> that because the temporary shed was (according to the
                    Defendants) constructed on a cost plus basis, the construction for the factory
                    plants under the Main Contracts must likewise be on the same basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Assuming
                    that the 6 June 1997 LOA was indeed the operative contract for the construction
                    of the temporary shed (for which I make no finding of), there was no documentary
                    evidence to prove that the Main Contracts would be awarded on the same basis as
                    that for the temporary shed. In the circumstances, the reliance by the
                    Defendants on the 6 June 1997 LOA to establish a breach of fiduciary duty on the
                    part of Colonel Chua was again, unfounded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Architect’s Evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Ms Tan’s evidence at trial was relied
                    upon by both parties in their closing submissions to prove whether Colonel Chua
                    only had the authority to award the Main Contracts on a cost plus basis.
                    Ms Tan recalled having many meetings with the consultants, the quantity
                    surveyor Mr Chng Swee Ling, and ECO IEE’s representatives to discuss
                    the construction of the factory plants. Initially, she could not remember which
                    of ECO IEE’s shareholders or directors were present at the meetings, apart
                    from Colonel Chua. However, when provided with a list of names, she was able to
                    recall seeing KC Tan and Goh SN at some of the meetings and that they were both
                        subcontractors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Ms Tan confirmed that in the beginning the
                    Defendants wanted to award the Main Contracts on a cost plus basis and not have
                    a tender selection process because they wanted the projects to “move very
                        fast”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Basically the Defendants did not want to adopt
                    the tender process which would take too much time. The quantity surveyor had
                    during the meetings advised on the advantages and disadvantages of the cost plus
                    basis. As cost was hard to establish due to price fluctuations, Ms Tan did
                    not encourage using the cost plus basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> She had advised them that for
                    industrial buildings, most contracts would be awarded on a lump sum basis. The
                    advantages and disadvantages of the measurement basis were also
                        discussed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Ms Tan emphasised that at this stage
                    (which I note was well past the 10 July 1996 meeting), there were still
                    ongoing discussions and no decision was “firmed up” on the cost
                    plus basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> and it was only later that Colonel Chua told
                    her that they have evaluated and have decided to use the measurement
                        basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> However, she had no idea on how the evaluation
                    took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Ms Tan further testified that the shareholders
                    of ECO IEE were able to “make the project fast” because most of
                    them were in the construction industry and thus no tendering was
                        required.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> No tender or invitation to quote was called
                    because the individual subcontractors were all “firmed up”
                    <em>before</em> the Main Contracts were
                        finalised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> In fact, the subcontractors started on their
                    works even <em>before</em> they signed the contracts.
                    Mr Gabriel during cross-examination asked Ms Tan for her impression on
                    whether the works were progressing on a cost plus basis since the cost plus
                    basis was still being discussed at that time. Ms Tan’s answer was
                    “my impression is I think they haven’t firmed up the price, but
                    they are eagerly [<em>sic</em>] to get the work done
                    – I think they trust each other at that time – our
                        impression”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> The relevant part of Ms Tan’s
                    evidence was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In my judgment, Colonel Chua being the
                    Managing Director was in charge of the daily operations of ECO IEE (and the
                    Defendants). He had the authority to award the Main Contracts on a basis which
                    he honestly and reasonably believed to be in the Defendants’ best interest
                    unless the board of directors at a board meeting and/or the shareholders at a
                    shareholders’ meeting had earlier stipulated, agreed or decided that the
                    Main Contracts were to be awarded only on a cost plus basis, which was not the
                    case as is clear from the evidence. Colonel Chua was advised on the positives
                    and negatives of the different bases for construction and eventually decided on
                    the measurement basis by incorporating the SIA Articles and Conditions of
                    Building Contract (Measurement Contract). Even if this decision subsequently
                    turned out to be a poor one, it is clear law that so long as a management
                    decision was taken <em>bona fide</em>, there would be no
                    breach of fiduciary duties. See <em>Intraco v Multi-Pak
                        Singapore</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at [30]. As stated by V
                    K Rajah JC in <em>Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng
                        Meng</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 at [15] to [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15 A director who by action or inaction causes losses to a company may
                        find his conduct being questioned. Without evidence of a lack of bona fides
                        however, it cannot properly be contended that directors are invariably
                        liable for all losses sustained by a company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16 In ECRC Land Pte Ltd v Ho Wing On Christopher [2004]
                        1 SLR(R) 105, Tay Yong Kwang J rightly opined at [49]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The court should be slow to interfere with commercial decisions taken
                            by directors (see Intraco Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd [1994]
                            3 SLR(R) 1064). It should not, with the advantage of
                            hindsight, substitute its own decisions in place of those made by
                            directors in the honest and reasonable belief that they were for the
                            best interests of the company, even if those decisions turned out
                            subsequently to be money-losing ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17 This judicial endorsement of the sanctity of business judgment is
                        underpinned by strong policy considerations. It is the role of the
                        marketplace and not the function of the court to punish and censure
                        directors who have in good faith, made incorrect commercial decisions.
                        Directors should not be coerced into exercising defensive commercial
                        judgment, motivated largely by anxiety over legal accountability and
                        consequences. Bona fide entrepreneurs and honest commercial men should not
                        fear that business failure entails legal liability. A company provides a
                        vehicle for limited liability and facilitates the assumption and
                        distribution of commercial risk. Undue legal interference will dampen, if
                        not stifle, the appetite for commercial risk and entrepreneurship.</p>

                        manner:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Eco was established by a close group of friends and
                            relatives who see the potential in waste management in Singapore and in
                            the region. The promoter group has limited financial capability, thus we
                            have to be very prudent in our budget. In the area of construction and
                            infrastructure development, the approach adopted was to capitalise on
                            the group’s strength in construction (most of the shareholders are
                            dealing with construction) to get the best value for money. The
                            arrangement was for shareholders to handle the construction ourselves
                            and the direct sourcing of specialised subcontractors to handle the
                            various portions of the projects. In that, we reduce unnecessary
                            commissions/margins applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    On documentation and procedures, we followed the
                            Singapore Institute of Architect’s Articles and Conditions of
                            Building Contracts. The contract is based on Measurement Contract or
                            BQ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The main contract was directly awarded to [Bing
                            Integrated]. Mr Chua Chin Giap, the owner of Bing Integrated is one
                            of the shareholders. <em>The sanitation works were
                                carried out by Mr Tan Keaw Chong (Chairman) and sewerage works
                                were done by Mr Goh Seng Nam (Director). All these were aimed
                                at trying to reduce cost by having the shareholders to help out in
                                expertise area and to ensure value for
                        money</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    It was a blessing to ECO that we had this
                            arrangement for the construction project, otherwise we may not be what
                            we are today. The reasons are:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The pace of construction was time and again
                            disrupted by funding problems. SWM construction project was delayed by 4
                            months, and RRC actual sorting centre was delayed by a year. If the
                            contract was given out to an outside contractor, the situation will be
                            totally different. The amount of liquidated damages and so on will be
                            unthinkable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The long delay in equity partnership finalisation
                            that led to financial difficulty in meeting with the progress claims.
                            Lots of goodwill and friendship were involved for the long delay in
                            settling construction claims. Had any of them try to sue us for payment
                            due, it would have been very nasty for us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    In terms of cost, we managed to save quite a bit in
                            view of the owner-direct negotiation with the various main
                            sub-contractors. <em>Take for example, the total BQ
                                contract for the RRC trial shed and facilities was more than
                                S$2.4million and the actual cost was S$2.1
                            million</em>...</p>

                    signed by Colonel Chua and hence the identity of the author was
                        uncertain.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> However, at the trial stage, Mr Gabriel
                    indicated that he did not question the authenticity of the 10 February 1999
                        letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Section 32(b) of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot
                        be found etc., is relevant</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32. Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who
                        is dead... are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of
                        business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made
                        by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business or in the discharge
                        of professional duty, or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of
                        the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind, or of a
                        document used in commerce, written or signed by him, or of the date of a
                        letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I am of the view that the letter was one made
                    in the “ordinary course of business”. Since it is not challenged
                    that the document (although not signed) was in existence as far back as 1999
                    well before this litigation commenced and no specific allegation is made that it
                    is a document fabricated recently for the purpose of bringing false evidence
                    before the court, I accept on its face that it was a statement made by the
                    deceased Colonel Chua. Had there been a clear challenge that it is not an
                    authentic document, then evidence could well be adduced on how the document was
                    discovered and whether the intended recipients of the letter had in fact
                    received the letter and if so, then when had they seen the letter. Having
                    accepted that it was not a statement made by some unknown person but by Colonel
                    Chua, who was unfortunately no longer present to testify in court, it is
                    strictly speaking still a hearsay document unless it can come within one of the
                    hearsay exceptions such as s 32(b) of the Evidence Act. On a plain reading of s
                    32(b), it is not necessary that the written statement of the deceased Colonel
                    Chua be signed. The 10 February 1999 letter is thus admissible and I
                    overruled Mr Gabriel’s objection.</p>

                    whether [1] of the 10 February 1999 letter described how the Plaintiff

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Defendants’ claim against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Third Party rested upon the absence of
                    tenders or quotations for the projects. Yet, the undeniable fact is that KC Tan
                    and Goh SN were awarded subcontracts based on their own expertise. They could
                    not prove that these subcontracts were secured by them following a tender
                    exercise or an invitation to quote. The assertion that their own price quotes
                    “must have been the lowest” appeared rather hollow and
                    self-serving. Goh SN had admitted that he did not know whether there had been
                    any quotation called for in respect of his sewage subcontract works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On the evidence, the shareholders of ECO IEE
                    had clearly decided to capitalise on their individual expertise to administer
                    the projects in order to kick start their investment in the waste management and
                    recovery business. As a consequence, they also benefitted themselves as
                    shareholders by having the subcontracts awarded to themselves in their
                    respective areas of expertise. The reliance on the principle in <em>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</em> [1998]
                    1 Ch 1 that a fiduciary may not act for his own benefit or the benefit
                    of a third person without the informed consent of the principal was therefore
                    unmerited. It was clearly their intention to construct the factory plants
                    without inviting quotations or tenders which would be a relatively longer
                    process. It was only for specialist subcontract works where the shareholders of
                    ECO IEE themselves had no expertise that tenders were called. KC Tan himself
                    acknowledged that tenders were called for such specialist subcontracts. In my
                    judgment, KC Tan was aware that tender exercises were carried out only in
                    respect of specialist subcontracts in which the shareholders had no expertise
                    in. For subcontract works which the shareholders had expertise in, no tenders or
                    quotations would have been necessary since they would be getting the
                    subcontracts and benefitting themselves. This view accords with the evidence of
                    Ms Tan that the subcontract works secured by the shareholders’ own
                    companies started even before the contracts were signed. Accordingly, the
                    Defendants’ claim that the Colonel Chua had breached his fiduciary duties
                    in failing to obtain the best possible price by calling for tenders or
                    quotations is without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the
                    Defendants’ claims in Suit No 605 of 2006/X and Suit No 606 of 2006/B
                    against the 1st Third Party for breach of fiduciary duties by Colonel Chua. The
                    consequential allegations of conspiracy between Colonel Chua, Bing Integrated
                    and 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party are also dismissed. In respect of
                    the early payment claim and the reimbursement claim, suffice it to say that the
                    allegations were not made out on the evidence. Accordingly, I dismiss the
                    Defendants’ claims. Unless the parties wish to be heard on costs, I award
                    costs to the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party, which are to be taxed
                    if not agreed.</p>
