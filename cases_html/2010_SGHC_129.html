<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff Swiss Butchery Pte Ltd
                    (“SB”) was in the business of retail and wholesale butchery and
                    production operations. In Suit No 245 of 2008/V
                    (“Suit No 245”), SB claims against the first defendant,
                    Huber Ernst, and second defendant, Huber Ryan Ernst, for breach of their duties
                    as a director and an executive of SB respectively and for the tort of
                    conspiracy. Further, SB claims against the other four defendants for, <em>inter alia</em>, conspiracy and dishonest assistance. In
                    Suit No 222 of 2008/W (“Suit No 222”), Huber
                    Ernst claims against the other shareholders of SB for relief under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) for
                    oppression against a minority shareholder. By an Order of Court dated
                    7 July 2008, both suits have been consolidated and the trial of
                    Suit No 245 proceeded before Suit No 222.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       SB made numerous allegations in
                    Suit No 245 which centred around SB’s allegation that Huber
                    Ernst diverted SB’s wholesale and production operations to Huber’s
                    Pte Ltd for the benefit of Huber Ernst and his two children. There was also a
                    claim for defamation against Huber Ernst and the sixth defendant, Thomas Norbert
                    Kreissl, but this was withdrawn during the proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Further, the defendants in
                    Suit No 222 have offered to buy out Huber Ernst’s shares in SB
                    without admission of liability in respect of the allegations of
                        oppression<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and it became unnecessary to go into such
                    allegations which, in any event, overlapped with the allegations in
                    Suit No 245. I will be giving directions separately on matters
                    pertaining to the valuation of Huber Ernst’s shares for the
                    buy-out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant law and legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Before considering the facts, I will set out the
                    applicable legal principles pertaining to the various causes of action <em>viz</em>, directors’ duties, the tort of conspiracy and
                    dishonest assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on directors’ duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Section 157 of the Companies Act provides for
                    the general duties owed by a director as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">157—(1) A director shall at all times act honestly and use
                        reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is trite that the courts will not interfere
                    with a management decision which is exercised in a <em>bona
                        fide</em> manner. As stated in <em>Walter Woon on
                        Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, Third Ed, 2005)
                        (“<em>Walter Woon</em>”) at paras 8.34
                    and 8.35:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.34  It is not for the
                            court to gauge what the interests of the company are. It has been said
                            that ‘directors must exercise their discretion bona fide in what
                            they consider (not what a court may consider) is the interests of the
                            company’. The courts do not sit as courts of appeal over decisions
                            of management. As Lord Wilberforce put it in <em>Howard
                                Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Their lordships accept that such a matter as the raising of finance is
                            one of management, within the responsibility of the directors: they
                            accept that it would be wrong for the court to substitute its opinion
                            for that of the management, or indeed to question the correctness of the
                            management’s decision, on such a question, if bona fide arrived
                            at. There is no appeal on merits from management decisions to courts of
                            law: nor will courts assume to act as a kind of supervisory board over
                            decisions within the powers of management honestly arrived at.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.35  This is judicial recognition of the fact that
                            different people can have different opinions about what is good for a
                            company and in its interests. Directors may take risks with the
                            company’s property where they honestly believe that to do so is in
                            the company’s interests. This is indeed the essence of
                            entrepreneurship. Just because a director makes a wrong decision does
                            not mean that he has breached his fiduciary duty to the company. The
                            above dicta imply that the test is subjective and the courts will not
                            interfere in a management decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The above passage in <em>Howard
                        Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd</em> (“<em>Howard Smith</em>”) quoted in <em>Walter
                        Woon</em> has been accepted in <em>Intraco Ltd v
                        Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064
                        (“<em>Intraco Ltd</em>”) at [325] where
                    the Court of Appeal considered that the transactions entered into by the
                    directors were based on a management decision which in retrospect, turned out to
                    be a poor decision. As the decision was arrived at <em>bona
                        fide</em>, the directors were not in breach of their fiduciary
                    duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the House of Lords decision of <em>Regal Hastings Ltd v Gulliver</em> [1967] 2 AC 134,
                    Viscount Sankey stated at 137 thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The general rule of equity is that no one who has duties of a
                        fiduciary nature to perform is allowed to enter into engagements in which he
                        has or can have a personal interest conflicting with the interests of those
                        whom he is bound to protect. If he holds any property so acquired as
                        trustee, he is bound to account for it to his <em>cesti que
                            trust</em>. The earlier cases are concerned with trusts of
                        specific property: <em>Keech v Sandford per</em> Lord
                        King LC. The rule, however, applies to agents, as, for example, solicitors
                        and directors, when acting in a fiduciary capacity. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the same case, Lord Russell of Killowen
                    similarly stated the strict rule of equity at 144 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rule of equity which insists on those, who by use of a fiduciary
                        position make a profit, being liable to account for that profit, in no way
                        depends on fraud, or absence of bona fides; or upon such questions or
                        considerations as whether the profit would or should otherwise have gone to
                        the plaintiff, or whether the profiteer was under a duty to obtain the
                        source of the profit for the plaintiff, or whether he took a risk or acted
                        as he did for the benefit of the plaintiff, or whether the plaintiff has in
                        fact been damaged or benefited by his action. The liability arises from the
                        mere fact of a profit having, in the stated circumstances, been made. The
                        profiteer, however honest and well-intentioned, cannot escape the risk of
                        being called upon to account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>Phipps v
                        Boardman</em> [1966] 3 WLR 1009, Lord Upjohn in his
                    dissenting judgment stated the nature of a fiduciary at 1066 thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rules of equity have to be applied to such a great diversity of
                        circumstances that they can be stated only in the most general terms and
                        applied with particular attention to the exact circumstances of each case.
                        The relevant rule for the decision of this case is <em>the
                            fundamental rule of equity that a person in a fiduciary capacity must
                            not make a profit out of his trust which is part of the wider rule that
                            a trustee must not place himself in a position where his duty and his
                            interest may conflict</em>. …[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Industrial Development
                        Consultants Ltd v Cooley</em> [1972] 1 WLR 443,
                    Roskill J held at [452]-[453] that the managing director of a company was
                    liable for a breach of his fiduciary duties because he used information obtained
                    while he was the company’s managing director for his own personal purposes
                    and profit, thereby putting his personal interest in direct conflict with his
                    pre-existing and continuing duty as managing director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Similarly, in <em>CMS Dolphin
                        Ltd v Simonet and another</em> [2001] 2 BCLC 704
                        (“<em>CMS Dolphin</em>”), Lawrence
                    Collins J held at <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a> that the
                    underlying basis of the liability of a director who exploits a maturing business
                    opportunity of the company after his resignation is that the opportunity is to
                    be treated as if it were property of the company in relation to which the
                    director had fiduciary duties. By seeking to exploit the opportunity after
                    resignation he is appropriating for himself that property. The director becomes
                    a constructive trustee of the fruits of his abuse of the company’s
                    property, which he has acquired in circumstances where he knowingly had a
                    conflict of interest and exploited it by resigning from the
                company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is thus clear that while the court will not
                    question a management decision which was exercised in a <em>bona
                        fide</em> manner, anyone who owes a fiduciary duty is not allowed to
                    enter into transactions in which he has a personal interest conflicting with the
                    interest of those whom he is bound to protect. More particularly, a director is
                    not allowed to make use of information obtained while he was a director of the
                    company in question or to exploit a maturing business opportunity of the company
                    for his own personal purposes and profit. Any profit so obtained will be subject
                    to a constructive trust in favour of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As held by the Court of Appeal in <em>Quah Kay Tee v Ong &amp; Co Pte Ltd</em> [1996]
                    3 SLR(R) 637 at [45], there are two types of tort of conspiracy
                    – conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The tort of conspiracy comprises two types: conspiracy by unlawful means
                        and conspiracy by lawful means. A conspiracy by unlawful means is
                        constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with
                        the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried
                        out and the intention achieved. In a conspiracy by lawful means, there need
                        not be an unlawful act committed by the conspirators. But there is the
                        additional requirement of proving a “predominant purpose” by
                        all the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff, and the act
                        is carried out and the purpose achieved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd
                        v Ching Kai Huat</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 at [23],
                    Prakash J summarised the elements that must be satisfied to prove both
                    forms of conspiracy:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order for the claim of conspiracy to succeed, the elements that have to
                        be satisfied are the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    a combination of two or more persons and an
                            agreement between them and amongst them to do certain
                        acts;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    if the conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the
                            predominant purpose of the conspirators must be to cause damage or
                            injury to the plaintiff but if the conspiracy involves unlawful means,
                            then such predominant intention is not required;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the acts must actually be performed in furtherance
                            of the agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    damage must be suffered by the
                        plaintiff.</p>

                    Ang J held at [34]-[35] that it is not the law that intention or purpose to
                    cause injury or damage to the plaintiff is not relevant to a conspiracy by
                    unlawful means. Ang J cited <em>Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK v
                        Al Bader</em> [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271 where
                    Nourse LJ pointed out that it is still necessary to establish an intention
                    or purpose to injure, but such intention or purpose need not be predominant. In
                        <em>Lim Leong Huat</em>, it was held that, where a
                    director has acted in a <em>bona fide</em> manner within
                    the scope of his authority but nevertheless causes injury or damage to a
                    plaintiff, a claim of conspiracy against him will fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for the definition of what constitutes
                    “unlawful means”, the Court of Appeal in <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 452 stated at [120] that the
                    element of unlawfulness covers both a criminal act or means, as well as an
                    intentional act that is tortious. The Court of Appeal cited the House of Lords
                    decision in <em>Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Total Network
                        SL</em> [2008] 1 AC 1174 where Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe
                    said at [93]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]ll the statements of general principle in the classic cases seem to me
                        to be consistent with the proposition that unlawful means, both in the
                        intentional harm tort and in the tort of conspiracy, include both crimes and
                        torts (whether or not they include conduct lower on the scale of
                        blameworthiness) provided that they are indeed the means by which harm is
                        intentionally inflicted on the claimant (rather than being merely incidental
                        to it).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     With regards to the burden of proof of
                    establishing a claim under the tort of conspiracy, in <em>Seagate
                        Technology Pte Ltd and anor v Goh Han Kim</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 836, Thean JA stated at [15] that a high degree of proof
                    is needed to discharge the burden of proving an allegation of conspiracy by
                    unlawful means. Similarly, in <em>Wu Yang Construction Group Ltd
                        v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co, Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 451,
                    Phang J stated at [93] that, although the standard of proof is still the
                    civil standard based on the balance of probabilities, the amount of proof
                    required was higher than that required in a normal civil action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In Suit No 245, SB pleaded its case
                    based on both types of the tort of conspiracy. The case based on the tort of
                    conspiracy by unlawful means is based on its allegation that the defendants
                    “wrongfully and with intent to injure [SB] and/or cause loss to [SB] by
                    unlawful means conspired and combined together to defraud [SB] and to conceal
                    such fraud and the proceeds of such fraud from [SB].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    On this ground, SB’s claim would succeed so long as the defendants
                    intended to cause harm to it. There is no need to prove the existence of such a
                    “predominant intention”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on dishonest assistance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The law on dishonest assistance has recently
                    been clarified by the Court of Appeal in <em>George Raymond Zage
                        III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and anor</em> [2010] SGCA 4
                        (“<em>George Raymond Zage III</em>”)
                    where V K Rajah JA reiterated the elements of a claim in dishonest
                    assistance at [40] thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The elements of a claim in dishonest assistance are: (a) the
                        existence of a trust; (b) a breach of that trust; (c) assistance
                        rendered by the third party towards the breach; and (d) a finding that
                        the assistance rendered by the third party was dishonest (see generally
                        Bansal Hermant Govindprasad and another v Central Bank of India [2003]
                        2 SLR(R) 33 (“Bansal”) and Caltong (Australia) Pty
                        Ltd v Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd [2002] 2 SLR(R) 94
                        (“Caltong”)). …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Prior to <em>George Raymond
                        Zage III</em>, it was uncertain as to whether the test for honesty in
                    a claim under dishonest assistance is an objective test or whether it is a
                    composite test with both an objective and subjective element (see <em>Bansal Hermant Govindprasad and another v Central Bank of
                        India</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 33; contrast <em>Malaysian International Trading Sdn Bhd v Interamerica Asia Pte Ltd and
                        anor</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 896). However in <em>George Raymond Zage III</em>, V K Rajah JA cited Barlow
                    Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Eurotrust International Ltd [2006]
                    1 All ER 377 (“Barlow Clowes”), where the Privy Council
                    affirmed that the objective test of honesty laid down in Royal Brunei Airlines
                    Sdn Bhd v Philip Tan Kok Ming [1995] 2 AC 378 was the applicable test
                    and that the decision in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] 2 All ER 377
                    did not depart from this test. It is worthwhile reiterating Lord Hoffman’s
                    speech in <em>Barlow Clowes</em> (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships accept that there is an element of ambiguity in [Lord
                        Hutton’s] remarks which may have encouraged a belief, expressed in
                        some academic writing, that the Twinsectra case had departed from the law as
                        previously understood and invited inquiry not merely into the
                        defendant’s mental state about the nature of the transaction in which
                        he was participating but also into his views about generally acceptable
                        standards of honesty. But they do not consider that this is what Lord Hutton
                        meant. The reference to ‘what he knows would offend normally accepted
                        standards of honest conduct’ meant only that his knowledge of the
                        transaction had to be such as to render his participation contrary to
                        normally acceptable standards of honest conduct. It did not require that he
                        should have had reflections about what those normally acceptable standards
                        were. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Court of Appeal in <em>George Raymond Zage III</em> thus affirmed that the test for
                    dishonest assistance is an objective test: for a defendant to be liable for
                    dishonest assistance, he must have such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings
                    of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach
                    of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query
                them.</p>

                    SB was incorporated to carry on the business of wholesale and retail butchery.
                    SB carried on its business at 30 and 32 Greenwood Avenue Singapore 289230

                    Nevertheless, he continued to attend meetings related to SB as her proxy and at

                    that Ernst was to operate the business but that he consulted with Alex and Don
                    Foo from time to time on major matters pertaining to the business. The extent to
                    which he consulted them and ought to have consulted them was in dispute as I

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The chronology of events</p>

                        each;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_e"></a>(e)     the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Prior to June 2005, Ernst would attend weekly
                    family gatherings held on Saturday evenings with his wife at Wang’s house
                    (“weekly gatherings”). Similarly, Don Foo, Alex and their spouses
                    would attend the weekly gatherings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> During these weekly gatherings,
                    apart from informally discussing the general affairs of the various families and
                    their children, Don Foo, Alex and Ernst would also informally discuss the
                    business of SB. Ernst would inform both Alex and Don Foo on relevant matters and
                    they would ask him any questions which they wished to know about SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> However, after
                    June 2005, Ernst stopped attending the weekly gatherings and he had since
                    visited Wang’s house only once during Chinese New Year in 2007 in
                    circumstances which I shall elaborate on later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The incident which sparked off a chain of
                    events leading to these proceedings was a meeting. Ernst had met with Alex and
                    Don Foo at Polo Club on 8 June 2005. Ryan was also in attendance. At this
                    meeting, Ernst suggested that SB issue Ryan with 6,000 shares at a price of
                    $14.64 per share (“Share Issue Proposal”) in order to provide Ryan
                    with an incentive to stay on in SB with the view that he would eventually
                    succeed Ernst. Each of the three shareholders was then holding 5,000 shares. The
                    Share Issue Proposal, if accepted, meant that Ernst and Ryan would hold 11,000
                    out of 21,000 shares, <em>ie</em>, a majority. Ernst handed
                    over a letter containing, <em>inter alia</em>, this
                    proposal but Alex and Don Foo merely said they would consider it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Share Issue Proposal was rejected by way
                    of a 3-page letter dated 18 June 2005 (“Letter of Rejection”)
                    drafted by Alex and Don Foo which was handed to Ernst’s wife at one of the
                    weekly gatherings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Apart from rejecting the Share Issue
                    Proposal, the Letter of Rejection also stated their disapproval of the
                    appointment of Ryan as the Deputy Managing Director of SB which was apparently
                    done without their knowledge and his salary of $6,500.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> As admitted in
                    cross-examination, Ernst was very angry with the contents of the Letter of
                    Rejection and he stopped attending the weekly gatherings from then
                        on.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There was a dispute as to whether Ernst had
                    directly told Alex and Don Foo that he had employed Ryan for SB. I am of the
                    view that he did not do so although they might have heard about it in the weekly
                    gatherings but they were unaware of his actual salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On 4 July 2005, Ernst made a different
                    proposal to purchase all the shares of the other shareholders in SB at a
                    mutually agreeable price (“Share Purchase Proposal”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> but this was
                    rejected on 14 July 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Following this, on 17 September
                    2005, HPL was incorporated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     SB claimed that Ernst bore a grudge against
                    the other shareholders for rejecting the Share Issue Proposal and the Share
                    Purchase Proposal and thus he embarked on a series of wrongful actions which
                    effectively transferred SB’s wholesale and production operations to HPL
                    and hence Ryan and Andre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>
                    The first preparatory step in this plan, according to SB, was the incorporation
                    of HPL. I would add that although SB did not list out all the preparatory steps
                    which it was relying on in the action in the particulars of its pleadings, I do
                    not think it was necessary to do so as long as the main thrust of its
                    allegations had been pleaded and the defendants were not caught by surprise to
                    the extent that they were unable to respond to the allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Owing to the proximity in time between the
                    rejection of the Share Issue Proposal and the Share Purchase Proposal in June
                    and July 2005 respectively and the incorporation of HPL in September 2005, Ernst
                    and Ryan sought to explain the circumstances surrounding HPL’s
                    incorporation. Ernst stated in his affidavit of evidence in chief
                    (“AEIC”) that Ryan was “crushed by this rejection and felt
                    that he had no future in [SB]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> When Ryan told
                    him about the incorporation of HPL, Ernst persuaded him not to leave SB and to
                    prove his worth to the other shareholders. Ernst also stated that he had hoped
                    to turn the other shareholders around to eventually accept his proposal for Ryan
                    to obtain shares in SB once they see the valuable contribution that Ryan was
                    making to SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For his part, Ryan stated that after rejection
                    of the Share Issue Proposal and Share Purchase Proposal, he became concerned
                    over his job in or about August 2005 and he made the decision to start his own
                    company and incorporated HPL in September 2005. He admitted in trial that the
                    intended business of HPL would be the production and wholesale of sausages and
                    meat products and that HPL’s potential customers would include the
                    then-existing customers of SB, including Shangri-la and Four Seasons, <em>etc</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, Ryan similarly
                    testified that Ernst persuaded him to give SB another ‘go’ in the
                    hope that the other shareholders would come around. He then shelved his plans to
                    run his own business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> He
                    repeatedly stated that HPL was only meant to be some sort of security and that
                    it was dormant in September 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However, the evidence militates against
                    finding that Ernst had asked Ryan to give SB another ‘go’ or that
                    Ryan agreed to do so. First, the other shareholders were very firm in their
                    rejection of the Share Issue Proposal. In the Letter of Rejection, it was
                    clearly stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.     Swiss Butchery was jointly started by 3
                        partners Ernst, Don and Alex. Ernst approached Don and Alex to start up the
                        business as he had recently lost his job. Don and Alex have indicated right
                        from day one that both have no knowledge of this speciality and agreed to
                        take the risk to join this business venture and giving full trust and faith
                        in Ernst by putting in money to start up the Butchery business. Each party
                        put in about S$200k x 3 = S$600k total for start up. Ernst had just sold his
                        house and therefore, could afford participating with S$200k. Ernst agreed to
                        be the key man running the business full time with salary paid from
                        investment fund…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.     Our agreement to go into this specialized
                        business is to realise gains and profitability, and grow the business long
                        term so that the three families can all enjoy the profits together. The
                        equal percentage holding was discussed and agreed unanimously at the very
                        start of the partnership and that we all shared the business risks
                        equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.     After 11 years into the business, and just
                        when we are beginning to realize our business return in a small way. What
                        was in the mind of the working managing director now with his proposal of
                        additional share issue and majority shareholding.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Similarly, in the rejection of the Share
                    Purchase Proposal, the language used was plain:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Please be informed that we have no intention to sell our shares as
                        you have requested”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Given the clear words used, it was hard to
                    believe that Ernst had hoped to change the other shareholders’ mind to
                    eventually accept his proposal for Ryan to be a shareholder of SB with new
                    shares. Another important factor against such a finding is that Ernst stopped
                    attending the weekly gatherings because he was very angry after he received the
                    Letter of Rejection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, there were only three or four
                    meetings, at a coffee shop near Greenwood Avenue, where the discussions were
                    apparently not forthcoming or pleasant. Why would Ernst who was in effect
                    severing his ties with Alex and Don still want his son to continue working in
                    SB? Did Ernst really hope to turn his in-laws around? I do not think
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Although Ernst’s wife had testified that
                    Ernst continued to go for the weekly gatherings after September 2005 until
                        2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> this
                    evidence was roundly contradicted by all other witnesses, including Ernst
                    himself. Taking into consideration the uncertain nature of Ernst’s
                    wife’s evidence when answering questions during cross-examination, I
                    attached no weight to her evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I also did not find Ernst or Ryan to be a
                    credible witness on material points. For example, Ernst said that he realised
                    that arithmetically the Share Issue Proposal which he made would put him and
                    Ryan in majority control but he also claimed that it was never his intention to
                    have such control. Ernst and Ryan also said that Ernst only realised that they
                    would gain majority control during a discussion with Ryan on their way to the
                    meeting at Polo Club on 8 June 2005. In my view, the 6,000 new shares was
                    not an arbitrary figure. It was calculated to give them majority control and
                    Ernst knew this all along and not only when he had a discussion with Ryan on the
                    way to the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Ryan suggested that the reason for trying to
                    acquire majority control in SB was so that his efforts put into SB would not be
                    wasted. There was some fear that Alex and Don Foo might otherwise try and sell
                    the business to a third party as Alex had brought third parties to view
                    Greenwood Avenue. In his AEIC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Ryan stated
                    at para 15 the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At that time, I was concerned to see that our efforts and hard work in
                        building up SB should not be “wasted”, and wanted EH and
                        myself to have more than 50% of the shares in SB, which would allow us to
                        run the business without the risk of Alex Wong and Don Foo selling their
                        shares and giving control of SB to a third party. SB’s auditors had
                        prepared a pricing of the shares for our discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I do not accept this reason. It would have
                    been very difficult to sell the business without Ernst’s consent as the
                    person running the operations and having a one-third stake in the business.
                    Furthermore, the Articles of Association of SB provide a pre-emption right for
                    existing shareholders in respect of shares held by the other shareholders.
                    Article 28 of SB’s Articles of Association states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shares may be freely transferred by a member or other person entitled to
                        transfer to any existing member selected by the transferor; but save as
                        aforesaid and save as provided by Article 33 hereof, no share shall be
                        transferred to a person who is not a member so long as any member or any
                        person selected by the directors as one whom it is desirable in the interest
                        of the Company to admit to membership is willing to purchase the same at the
                        fair value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     If Alex and Don Foo had really intended to
                    sell their shares in SB, Ernst would be able to exercise his pre-emption right
                    for the shares under the Articles of Association. In my view, Ernst must have
                    felt that he was the person mainly responsible for SB’s success. He was
                    not content to remain as a minority shareholder. Neither was he content to let
                    Ryan put in as much effort as he had done in SB unless his family had majority
                    control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Also, HPL’s start-up capital was
                    $100,000. Although Ryan was registered as the sole shareholder, the $100,000 was
                    provided by Ernst.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> If HPL was really intended to be a dormant
                    company, there would have been no reason to start up with such a substantial sum
                    of money. When cross-examined, Ryan testified that in late August 2005, he went
                    to see SB’s company secretary, Miss Chua from Prima Management Pte Ltd,
                    and told her that he wanted to set up his own company. She then informed him
                    that the paid-up capital to be filled in the application form was the amount
                    that he wanted to put into the bank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> He then decided on $100,000 despite
                    not having the sum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Even then, Ryan’s evidence did not
                    explain why he came up with a figure of $100,000 instead of a nominal figure of,
                    say, $2. Ernst’s evidence that he gave $100,000 to Ryan even though HPL
                    would not be operational and that it was a backup plan was unconvincing. There
                    was no plausible reason why, Ernst, an experienced businessman, would have given
                    his son $100,000 to be locked up in a company which was to remain dormant. This
                    conduct is hardly consistent with the assertion by Ernst that he had managed to
                    persuade Ryan to stay in SB and to prove his worth to the other
                    shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It is not in dispute that Ernst was already
                    involved in the manner stated above, in the incorporation of HPL in September
                    2005 after the earlier rejection of the Share Issue Proposal and the Share
                    Purchase Proposal. In my view, Ernst was taking a preparatory step in a
                    conspiracy with Ryan, a conspiracy which was eventually to involve Andre , to
                    divert the wholesale and production operations from SB to HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ernst, Ryan and Andre viewed properties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     SB alleged that, from January to March 2006,
                    Ernst and Ryan had visited factories for the benefit of HPL in breach of their
                    fiduciary duties to SB. Andre had joined them for those visits after he retuned
                    in January 2006.To establish this allegation, SB relied on certain photographs
                    found in its computers showing them visiting factories in various
                        locations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Ernst did not deny that they were
                    looking at properties but he testified that they were looking at factory space
                    for SB which was short of space at Greenwood Avenue. Ryan and Andre were then
                    still at SB and he hoped that they could expand SB if they had stayed
                        there.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> One factor which might support this position
                    is that the photographs were found in SB’s computers which could indicate
                    that they might have indeed been looking at factory space for SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, this was not the end of the matter.
                    Under cross-examination, Ernst admitted that in early 2006, there was no
                    discussion between him, Alex and Don Foo on the possible acquisition of a
                    factory for SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> As stated above, Ernst would discuss major
                    matters of SB with them. Yet, he did not even inform them about the potential
                    acquisition of a property for a factory outlet, an issue of substantial
                    importance. In contrast, when SB opened a retail outlet in Ridgewood Condominium
                    in 1997 or 1998, this was known to both Alex and Don Foo through discussions
                    with Ernst.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Even during the operation of the retail outlet,
                    they had discussions at the weekly gatherings (before Ernst stopped attending)
                    on how to improve the business at that outlet which was not doing
                        well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Also, when a representative from NTUC
                    Fairprice Co-Operative Limited (“NTUC Fairprice”), Mr Chandra
                    Das, approached Ernst in 2001 to ask if SB would be interested in opening an
                    outlet in the NTUC supermarket in Parkway Parade, Ernst had discussed the
                    proposal with Alex and Don Foo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Don Foo’s version of events
                    after the discussion differs from Ernst’s version in that he stated that
                    he had told Ernst to discuss further with Mr Chandra Das but Ernst did not
                    give any further updates on the proposal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, Ernst testified
                    that the proposal was rejected by Alex and Don Foo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, the
                    important point in my view was that a discussion indisputably took
                place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Contrasting the approach taken by Ernst in the
                    above two incidents with the approach taken when he viewed the various
                    properties with Ryan and Andre from January to March 2006, I am of the view that
                    it was unlikely that Ernst was viewing properties in early 2006 for SB. In
                    addition, Ernst had stated that SB faced space constraint in its operation and
                    that was the number one reason (in terms of importance) why SB ceased its
                    wholesale operations in March 2007. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> According to Ernst, he only made
                    the final decision to stop SB’s wholesale and production operations in
                    January 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Space constraint must therefore have been a
                    continuing problem at least from January 2006 to January 2007. Yet, there was no
                    evidence that he took any further step after March 2006 to look for factory
                    space for SB. Instead, it was Ryan who found a property for HPL around July 2006
                    in circumstances which I shall elaborate on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Increase of HPL’s capital from $100,000 to $400,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Andre stated that he returned to Singapore in
                    January 2006 because Ernst was not in the best of health and he wanted to learn
                    from Ernst and Ryan who had been his “role models”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Consequently, he
                    joined SB on 1 February 2006 as a Sales and Marketing Executive. Andre
                    stated that when Ryan told him in March 2006 about HPL’s earlier
                    incorporation, he saw a future in working with his brother and hence he joined
                    HPL as a shareholder and director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> He added that he felt a little
                    unsafe about his position in SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The paid-up capital of HPL was then
                    increased to $400,000 on 29 March 2006 and the money was again provided by
                        Ernst.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Both Ryan and Andre insisted that they had
                    chosen $400,000 because they felt that it was the right amount as a form of
                    security and that it was an arbitrary figure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>Also, HPL was
                    intended to remain dormant at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> Again, just like at the
                    incorporation stage, the substantial increase in the capital of HPL (by
                    $300,000) begged the question as to why such a huge sum of money was needed for
                    a dormant company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In my view, the increase in HPL’s
                    capital showed that Ernst, Ryan and Andre were preparing to use the $400,000 for
                    HPL. This constituted the next step in the conspiracy to divert business
                    operations of SB to HPL following the incorporation of HPL in September 2005 and
                    the viewing of various properties from January to March 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Although the fact that Andre joined SB could
                    be said to be an indication that he had wanted to work in SB, the totality of
                    evidence went against such a conclusion. More likely than not, he had joined SB
                    with the intention of biding time; he was waiting for HPL to be fully
                    operational. As will be seen from the subsequent paragraphs, during his time in
                    SB, Andre established contacts with existing and potential clients of SB which
                    proved useful for HPL later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alex alleged to have said it was a mistake for Ryan and Andre to join
                SB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     According to Ernst, Ryan and Andre, the
                    incident which sparked Ryan’s and Andre’s departure from SB was that
                    Alex had said in a coffee-shop meeting around May or June 2006 with Ernst and
                    Don Foo that it was a mistake for Ernst to bring his two sons into
                        SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Ryan
                    stated that Ernst told him about this and he was “deeply
                    demoralized” and he told Ernst and Andre that he no longer felt any
                    motivation to work at SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> As for Andre, he felt very
                    disappointed and that was when Ryan and he decided that they had no future in SB
                    and that it was best if they struck out on their own.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     SB failed to call Alex as a witness to rebut
                    the allegation of what he purportedly said. As such, I draw an adverse inference
                    against SB under section 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev
                    Ed). On the other hand, as Alex was alleged to have said the above in a meeting
                    where Don Foo was present and Don Foo had denied the allegation there was some
                    evidence to counter the allegation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> However, this in itself was
                    insufficient to overcome the adverse inference. Additional evidence would be
                    needed to which I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In Ernst’s initial defence during the
                    pleading stage, he did not make any reference to this allegation at all. Even in
                    his amended defence, all that was stated in para 9 of his pleading
                    was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In or about 8 June 2005, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                        had proposed to the other shareholders that in view of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s age, Ryan should
                        continue in the Plaintiffs when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                        retires. Accordingly, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had, in
                        or about 8 June 2005, proposed that the Plaintiffs issue and allot
                        6,000 new shares to Ryan as an incentive for him to stay on with the
                        Plaintiffs. <em>However, the other shareholders of the
                            Plaintiffs did not agree to this proposal and both Ryan and Andre
                            eventually left the Plaintiffs’ employment in or about
                            20 September 2006</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The omission to allude to the alleged
                    statement by Alex was glaring to say the least. It was mentioned by Ernst only
                    in his AEIC. Also, for Ryan and Andre, this allegation was included only by way
                    of amendment to their pleadings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> It was incredible that the catalyst (as
                    alleged) for the departure of Ryan and Andre from SB and the subsequent
                    operation of HPL would be treated with such scant attention by all three of them
                    during the earlier stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In addition, the circumstances were such that
                    it was unlikely that Alex would have said that it was a mistake for Ryan and
                    Andre to join SB if Ernst and his family did not have majority control. As
                    stated above, Ernst was the person in charge of SB’s operations. Having
                    Ryan and Andre’s assistance in SB would only provide greater benefits to
                    SB while at the same time, control in terms of shareholding would not be
                    conceded to them. This would have been the best of both worlds for Alex and Don
                    Foo and there would be no reason for Alex to have complained at all for the
                    extra help except perhaps for any difference of views over the salaries of Ryan
                    and Andre when he came to learn about the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In my view, the allegation about Alex’s
                    statement was an afterthought in order to explain the earlier viewing of
                    properties in January to March 2006 and to justify Ryan’s and
                    Andre’s departure from SB on 30 September 2006 in order to
                    concentrate on their activities in HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purchase of property at 161 Pandan Loop</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Ryan stated that, after hearing from Ernst
                    what Alex was alleged to have said in May or June 2006, he became aware of a
                    food factory for sale, <em>ie</em>, the
                        Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> He paid a deposit of $7,250 on 15 July 2006
                    for the option to purchase the Property for $725,000 (“purchase
                        price”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> It was not disputed that Ryan had made the
                    payment of the deposit for HPL’s purposes and that he was still the Deputy
                    Managing Director of SB at that point in time. Neither was it disputed that he
                    did not offer the opportunity to acquire the Property to SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> He had admitted
                    that the Property was suitable for the purposes of SB and that SB was supposedly
                    still looking for a property in July 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> He should
                    therefore have offered the opportunity to SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     On 31 July 2006, Ernst exercised the
                    option to purchase by making a payment of $29,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>According to Ryan, he was unable to
                    obtain a bank loan of 80% of the purchase price from either the Development Bank
                    of Singapore Ltd or Hong Leong Finance Limited because HPL was not in operation
                    yet and because of his existing salary of $6,550.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Hence, he asked Ernst for
                    assistance and the latter approached Hong Leong Finance Limited which was
                    willing to offer him a loan. However, Jurong Town Corporation
                    (“JTC”), the landlord of the Property, informed Ernst that because
                    the Property was a commercial property, it could not be purchased in the name of
                    an individual.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Consequently, Ernst registered a sole
                    proprietorship, HC, and used it to apply for a loan from Hong Leong Finance
                    Limited for 50% of the purchase price, <em>ie</em>,
                    $363,000. The loan was subsequently granted on 12 September 2006 with Ryan
                    and Andre acting as guarantors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> The
                    monthly instalments for repayment of the loan were paid by Ernst through
                        HC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As stated in the preceding paragraph, Ernst
                    exercised the option to purchase on 31 July 2006. This goes against
                    Ernst’s evidence in his AEIC that Ryan approached him for financial
                    assistance only in October 2006. He stated at para 89:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sometime in October 2006, Ryan asked me for assistance as he could not
                        obtain a loan of $363,000.00 from Hong Leong Finance to finance the purchase
                        of a factory space for use by HPL as he was just starting out and did not
                        have a track record. I met the branch manager at Hong Leong Finance at
                        Beauty World and was told that a commercial property cannot be purchased in
                        the name of an individual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Ernst eventually made payment for the balance
                    of the purchase price of the Property with part-payment from the loan. He
                    returned the deposit of $7,250 to Ryan or HPL on 23 August 2006. HC thus
                    obtained the remaining lease of the Property. On 20 November 2007, HC
                    entered into a tenancy agreement with HPL to lease the Property to
                        HPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The position taken by Ryan in his AEIC and the
                    evidence at trial in relation to the circumstances surrounding the purchase of
                    the Property was inconsistent with that taken at the pleadings stage where it
                    was stated at para 9(h) in his defence that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant only sourced for
                        factory space for his own intended business operations well after he left
                        the employment of the Plaintiffs in September 2006, and thereafter secured
                        the lease of the premises at 161 Pandan Loop in November 2006.”
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above demonstrated a crucial inconsistency in Ryan’s
                    position. During trial, he had accepted that when he came to know that the
                    Property was for sale in June 2006, he had already decided to acquire the
                    Property for HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In addition, although Ryan insisted that he
                    had purchased the Property without any certainty of further support from
                        Ernst,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> it is implausible that Ryan and Andre would have
                    committed themselves to the acquisition of the Property, as well as the
                    additional cost of machinery and renovation, without first ensuring that they
                    would obtain some form of support from Ernst in terms of finance and
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     From the time when HPL was incorporated to the
                    purchase of the Property, Ernst had supported Ryan and Andre financially to the
                    tune of about $800,000 (HPL’s paid-up capital of $400,000 and $384,000
                    cash as part-payment for the Property, the rest being paid by the $363,000
                    loan). Furthermore, Ernst contributed another $400,000 towards the purchase of
                    machinery and for renovations to the Property which cost a total of around
                        $1.1m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> The level of financial
                    commitment by Ernst clearly shows that he was a part of, if not integral to, the
                    plan of diverting some of SB’s operations to HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misleading others of the relationship between SB and HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Ernst in his evidence stated that in January
                    2007, he made a “strategic decision” that SB should focus only on
                    its more profitable retail business and give up its wholesale and processing
                        operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> This was implemented in March 2007 by
                    diverting these operations to HPL. Ryan and Andre testified that they had made
                    clear to others from the beginning that SB and HPL were separate and independent
                    entities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     However, when one considers the evidence in
                    the following part of this judgment, it is obvious that instead of making the
                    separation clear, Ernst, Ryan and Andre had misled both employees and third
                    parties who had dealings with SB to think that SB was related to HPL in order to
                    facilitate the divestment of some of SB’s operations to HPL and to
                    facilitate the start-up of HPL’s own operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Employees of SB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Several employees and ex-employees of SB such
                    as Joan Say Ju Li (“Joan Say”), Casile Joyce Marie

                    that they were under the impression that SB and HPL were related

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Joan Say was employed by SB as an

                    phone orders meant for SB to HPL as wholesale orders would from then on be
                    handled by HPL. She was under the impression that SB and HPL was affiliated and
                    HPL was a subsidiary of SB as HPL was run by Ryan and Andre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In cross-examination, Joan Say clarified that
                    Andre had, with the knowledge of Ernst and Thomas, instructed her to forward
                    these faxes. Ernst had told her that Andre would tell her what to write for the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Joan Say testified that Andre was the one who
                    called her and sent her an email with the content to write for the introductory
                    faxes and when she showed Ernst the introductory faxes, he had waved to her and
                    asked her to “go ahead, fax it”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> Ernst had denied in
                    cross-examination that he had seen these introductory faxes until much
                        later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> However, when informed by counsel that in his
                    AEIC, he had alluded to this correspondence,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> Ernst
                    clarified that what he meant was at the time of affirming his AEIC, he had seen
                    those faxes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> This seemed to be an attempt to dissociate
                    himself from any knowledge of the contents of the introductory faxes before they
                    were sent, especially when he admitted that a reader would form the impression
                    that the modern factory under the name of HPL would be part of the SB
                        group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Joan Say also testified that the content of
                    the faxes on elaboration came from Andre. Andre testified that he did not tell
                    Joan Say to state that SB’s wholesale and production operations had been
                    taken over by HPL’s factory <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> and that he did not see the text of
                    the faxes before they were sent out. His position was that even though he had
                    given her instructions to send the faxes, he did not tell her to use the term
                    “taken over” but to state that SB had “stopped” and
                    to recommend HPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> He further testified that Joan Say sent out the
                    faxes without his input on the full details of the faxes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I find Joan Say to be the more credible of the
                    two witnesses, <em>ie</em>, Joan Say and Andre. Even if I
                    were to believe Andre, which I do not, Andre admitted that he had seen the
                    introductory faxes about one or two weeks after they had been sent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Yet he chose not
                    to correct the purported errors because “what was done is
                        done”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> In my view, he did not correct them because they
                    contained what he wanted them to say.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As for Marie, she was employed by SB as an
                    administrative assistant in or about May 2007 and Joan Say was her direct
                    superior. She formed the impression that SB, HPL and HB were related companies
                    when Joan Say told her that they were all run by the same people and the only
                    difference was that HPL mainly dealt with wholesale business while SB did the
                    retail business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> Marie stated in her AEIC that after Joan Say
                    left SB in or about October 2007, Thomas had told Marie to continue with the
                    practice of forwarding fax orders sent to SB by wholesale customers to HPL and
                    giving HPL’s contact number to phone-order customers for them to place
                    their orders with HPL directly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     An important witness was Tan KW, who was
                    employed by Swiss Butchery since October 2006 as a sales executive. Tan KW
                    testified that during this time, Thomas had in one of the weekly staff briefings
                    said that SB’s wholesale and meat processing operations would no longer be
                    at Greenwood Avenue and would be moved to Pandan Loop and that two employees
                    would be transferred to Pandan Loop, namely Mike Tan and Johnny.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> In a separate
                    briefing, Thomas told them that if any customer went to SB’s shop at
                    Greenwood Avenue to place orders around closing hours, the staff was to
                    re-direct them to the NTUC Bukit Timah outlet (“NTUC Finest”).
                    This evidence was corroborated by Yeow JT although he could only state that the
                    date of the briefing was before June 2007 and he could not remember whether it
                    was Ernst or Thomas who conducted the briefing. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> I note that Thomas did not deny
                    that he had told the employees that SB would be closing its production at
                    Greenwood Avenue (although he disputed the use of the word
                    “transfer”) and to re-direct retail customers who went to
                    Greenwood Avenue nearing its closing hours to the outlet at NTUC Finest.
                    However, his position was that he had done so on the instructions of
                        Ernst.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Tan KW was under the impression that SB and
                    HPL belonged to the same company and that Mike Tan and Johnny were “still
                    under one roof working with us together at a separate location at a new factory
                    called Huber’s Factory.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> He stated that during the relevant
                    period of time, it was made known to the majority of the staff of SB that SB was
                    either a sister or related company of HPL. Tan KW also testified that apart from
                    redirecting calls from wholesale customers to HPL, there was even a telephone
                    number with Andre’s and Ryan’s name written on a small note placed
                    just beside the phone in SB’s retail shop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> Such friendly cooperation served
                    to reinforce to the employees that HPL was in some way related to
                SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Another witness called to establish that the
                    employees’ general impression was that SB and HPL were related was Tan HH.
                    As Tan HH is currently unemployed, he would have little or no incentive to lie.
                    Tan HH was a Butcher Supervisor and started working for SB since March 2005.
                    Like the above witnesses, Tan HH testified that he was under the impression that
                    SB and HPL were related because Ernst was one of the directors of SB and HPL was
                    operated by his sons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> It can be seen that the employees (or
                    ex-employees) were under the impression that SB and HPL were related. If the
                    defendants had indeed been clear to the employees as to the distinction between
                    SB and HPL, it would hardly have been likely that such a misconception would
                    have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Email with supplier for own brand name</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Apart from the employees, the email between
                    Ernst, Ryan and Andre and third parties revealed that they were creating the
                    impression that SB and HPL were related. For instance, in a chain of email
                    during the period of September 2006, it was revealed that they initially had a
                    discussion with a supplier, Australian Lamb Company Pte Ltd
                    (“ALC”), about having their own brand name for their products. The
                    first meeting took place with a John Verrell way back in May 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> On 29 September
                    2006, Greg Haines, another representative of ALC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> sent an email to
                    sales@swissbutchery.com addressed to Andre Huber which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Andre,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">John Verrell discussed with your dad &amp; I think you or your brother
                        back in May, offering you your own brand with your Company name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please confirm you are happy to do this &amp; send details for the
                        printing of your own brand….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In Andre’s email dated on the same date,
                    he stated thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Greg,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would be great if we could have our own brand. I will have to
                        brainstorm some possible brand names with my brother. Please let me know if
                        you have any to recommend.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Commencement date looks to be pushed back to late November – early
                        December. This is due to the delay in machinery arriving from Germany. I
                        will keep you updated on the progress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Ernst had stated that SB chose not to proceed
                    with the proposal in May 2006 because of costs issues.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> It has to be
                    noted that counsel for SB had put two different versions of his case to Ryan and
                    Andre respectively. With Ryan, SB’s position was that the opportunity for
                    a brand name was offered to SB way back in May 2006 but Ryan converted the
                    opportunity for the benefit of HPL subsequently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> As for Andre, SB’s
                    position was that the opportunity in May 2006 was offered to HPL at
                    inception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Despite the ambiguity in SB’s own
                    position, one thing was clear to me. Ernst was synonymous with SB. The contact
                    with John Verrell must have arisen from business dealings with SB. John Verrell
                    would have thought Ernst, Ryan and/or Andre was representing SB unless it was
                    made clear to him that Ernst was representing SB while Ryan and/or Andre was
                    representing HPL. The meeting with John Verrell was in May 2006, <em>ie</em>, before Ryan or Andre had even tendered their notices
                    of resignation dated 31 July 2006 and 31 August 2006 respectively from
                    SB. All three must have been representing SB then. Furthermore, the email from
                    Greg Haines suggested that he was thinking of Ernst and Ryan representing the
                    one and the same company, <em>ie</em>, SB. Andre’s
                    email reply did not clarify the situation but continued with the deception. The
                    reference to the commencement date was then referring to the commencement of
                    HPL’s factory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discussion with NTUC Fairprice representatives</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Another example supporting the allegation that
                    Ernst, Ryan and Andre had actively misled third parties in order to divert
                    business opportunities of SB to HPL concerned the discussion between Ernst, Ryan
                    and Andre and representatives from NTUC Fairprice, namely Lester Lee, Victor
                    Chai and Poh Sen Kah in October 2006 regarding the opening of a butchery counter
                    in NTUC Finest at Bukit Timah Plaza. Ernst’s version was that he had met
                    up with the NTUC Fairprice representatives initially. He decided that SB would
                    not be interested because SB had allegedly already rejected an NTUC proposal in
                    2001. He had asked the NTUC Fairprice representatives to talk to Ryan and Andre,
                        <em>ie</em>, with HPL instead. At the next meeting, he
                    was merely having coffee with the NTUC Fairprice representatives and when Ryan
                    and Andre arrived, he left after doing the introductions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> Similarly,
                    Andre testified that Ernst merely introduced them and left.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> He insisted
                    that he and Ryan had clarified that SB and HPL were separate
                        companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, the subsequent email which took place
                    after the two meetings suggests otherwise. On 6 October 2006, Poh Sen
                    Kah’s email was sent to sales@swissbutchery.com and was addressed to
                    Ernst. The relevant content of the email is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Mr. Ernst Huber,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1) Mr. Ernst Huber have brief us that Swiss Butchery production
                        section will be moving out to a new premise under a different name
                        “Huber company” and can be ready by end Nov 2006, he further
                        stress that the new production house will be to producing more Sausages and
                        Hams to supply and to retailer either pre-packed or bulk.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2) … Swiss Butchery will draft up a proposal for Fairprice for
                        further discussion, do let us know the date so that we can followup.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there is any points that I have missed out, kindly put it into this
                        mail for everybody.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As can be seen, contrary to Ernst’s
                    assertion that he merely introduced Ryan and Andre at the second meeting and
                    left thereafter, the email stated clearly that it was Ernst who conducted the
                    briefing. Further, on 13 November 2006, Lester Lee, who was the Fresh Food
                    Task Group Manager of NTUC Fairprice, also sent an email to
                    sales@swissbutchery.com addressed to Ernst. The content of the email is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Mr. Ernst Huber,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The time have pass very fast, believed that you have settled down the new
                        production plant soon and started the Year End Sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The new layout plan for Bukit Timah Plaza store is finalize, please do let
                        me know when we can meet again to discuss further with our planned in your
                        convenience time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hope that you can spare some time for us to explore the whole
                            project…<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As can be seen, the email from NTUC Fairprice
                    representatives were sent to sales@swissbutchery.com and addressed to Ernst.
                    More importantly, the contents of Poh Sen Kah’s email clearly showed that
                    Ernst was the one who had briefed them about SB moving out to a new production
                    house under a different name “Huber company”. This went against
                    his assertion that the NTUC Fairprice representatives were clearly told
                    otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Although Andre repeatedly claimed he had
                    stated clearly to the NTUC Fairprice representatives that SB and HPL were
                    separate, this was not borne out by the evidence. He stated that he always
                    corrected Lester when he called them SB even right up to the time HPL
                        opened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Yet when given the chance to correct the
                    misconception in writing, he did not utilise it. In Poh Sen Kah’s email,
                    he had specifically stated that “If there is any points [<em>sic</em>] that I have missed out, kindly put it into this
                    mail for everybody.” This clearly would have been an opportune moment for
                    Ryan and Andre to clarify any error as to the relationship between HPL and SB
                    but instead, nothing was done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     It is unlikely that representatives from an
                    established commercial entity such as NTUC Fairprice would have formed the
                    mistaken impression that SB and HPL were related to each other if it had been
                    explained clearly (and repeatedly) to them that they were separate. More likely
                    than not, Ernst, Ryan and Andre were using SB’s name to mislead the NTUC
                    Fairprice’s representatives in order to obtain the contract for opening a
                    retail counter at NTUC Finest. The contract was eventually awarded and the
                    retail outlet was operated by HPL through HB. Although Ryan and Andre said that
                    they did not view SB as a competitor of HPL, the fact remained that way back in
                    October 2006, there were already negotiations with NTUC Fairprice to open the
                    butchery counter at NTUC Finest which was undeniably a retail business. HPL was
                    thus competing with SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Email to potential wholesale customers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Another series of email also revealed that
                    Andre had tried to create the false impression that SB and HPL were
                        related.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> In November 2006, one Puja Pawa sent an email
                    to sales@swissbutchery.com addressed to Andre concerning the purchase of
                    “swiss butchery products” for his café and it was stated that
                    Andre had mentioned in a previous meeting that he would only be able to supply
                    him after October. The reply on 14 November 2006 from Andre is
                    telling:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Puja,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sorry for the delay in mailing back but I am currently busy with setting
                        up a factory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The factory will be running under a different name but will be handling
                        the wholesale side of the business. Products will be the same as the Swiss
                        Butchery price list but hopefully prices will be reduced slightly. I am in
                        the midst of coming up with a revised price list. The factory will only be
                        operational in early January. I will contact you once I have the new product
                        / price list to arrange a suitable meeting date. I can be better contacted
                        at andre@hubers.com.sg.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It is worth remembering that Andre had already
                    left the services of Swiss Butchery in November 2006 but yet he was still having
                    access to SB’s email account. The reason given was that he was trying to
                    help his father. While I accept that he did try to help his father from time to
                    time, he should not have been involved with SB’s operations given his
                    intentions for HPL. He should not have been allowed continued (and sole) access
                    to SB’s email account and even sending replies which appeared to emanate
                    from SB. Nowhere in his email reply did he state that SB and HPL were separate.
                    True, he stated that he could be contacted at his new email address but more
                    importantly, he had stated that the new factory would be running under a
                    different name and “will be handling the wholesale side of the
                    business.” This clearly gave rise to the inference that the only change
                    would be the name of the factory but the product would still be similar to
                    SB’s products with a revised price list. I do not think that a reference
                    to a different price list was enough to alert Puja Pawa that this was a
                    completely different set-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Correspondence with OBE Organic</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In response to an email inquiry from Dalene
                    Brook, a representative of another supplier, on 21 November 2006, Andre
                    replied thus:</p>

                    between SB and HPL. A reader would probably infer from the email that the new
                    factory (which in this case would be HPL’s factory) would be a factory of
                    SB and that it would be handling the wholesale side of SB’s

                    been misleading a third party about the relationship between SB and HPL. On
                    1 December 2006, one Jolene Limuco from a magazine publication Wine and
                    Dine asked whether SB would be willing to assist the magazine in their January

                        Firstly Swiss Butchery is simply too busy during this period and secondly,
                        we will be shifting our production and wholesale business over to the
                        factory in January. The factory is run under a separate company name so
                        doing a feature now will confuse readers. However I will be more than happy
                        to assist you in features once the factory is up and running sometime in
                        mid-January. The factory will place high emphasis on food safety and will
                        utilise modern machinery and equipment to produce high quality products for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Under cross-examination, Ernst had admitted
                    that the word “we” in the email would appear to an ordinary reader
                    to mean SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> Therefore, it in effect suggested that the
                    existing production business of SB would be shifted to the new factory,
                        <em>ie</em>, the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Supplies of Meat Products to Brewerks </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    SB also called upon Tan Leng Chuan
                    (“Tan LC”), the executive chef of Brewerks Restaurant, Singapore,
                    Riverside Point Branch (“Brewerks”) to give evidence. As the
                    executive chef, he was in charge of sourcing, purchasing and ordering food
                    supplies including fresh meats for Brewerks. He testified that Brewerks had been
                    purchasing its meat supplies from SB since 2002. In early 2007, Andre approached
                    him and told him that SB would be expanding its operation in the name of
                        HPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> According to Tan LC, Andre had told him

                    should be placed with HPL and all invoices would be issued by HPL. Apart from
                    this change, the arrangement for the purchase orders remained the same as when
                    Brewerks were purchasing from SB, <em>ie</em>, placing
                    orders with the same clerk and having the same delivery person, <em>ie</em>, Kelvin Goh. Tan LC was thus under the impression

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In cross-examination, Tan LC affirmed that
                    Andre had told him that SB and HPL were the same company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> When questioned
                    about Brewerks renewing their purchase of meat products from SB in April 2008,
                    Tan LC stated that Brewerks stopped its purchase from HPL because of the many
                    occasions in end 2007/early 2008 when poor quality meat was delivered on
                    Saturdays. He finally decided to stop purchasing from HPL after it delivered
                    less ground beef than agreed for on one Saturday.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> He added that he had
                    initially not called SB when sourcing new suppliers as he thought that they were
                    the same. It was only when a supplier told him that SB and HPL were separate
                    companies that he contacted SB to purchase from it again.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on this issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    All the above incidents showed that Ernst,
                    Ryan and Andre intended to, and in fact, took active steps to mislead others
                    into believing that SB and HPL were related. They did so in order to ensure that
                    the divestment of SB’s operations would be accompanied by the divestment
                    of SB’s business contacts for wholesale and production. Ernst suggested
                    that since SB had ceased its wholesale and production operations, it was only in
                    line with good customer service that SB direct its customers to alternative
                    suppliers or even one particular supplier (in this case HPL) if SB was confident
                    in HPL’s quality. However, the various steps undertaken by Ernst, Ryan and
                    Andre from September 2005 to March 2007 show clearly that they were embarking on
                    an elaborate plan to wrongfully deprive SB of some of its business operations in
                    the first place. Also, Andre was able to familiarise himself with the nature of
                    SB’s wholesale business and at the same time gain valuable access to
                    SB’s wholesale customers. This facilitated the divestment of SB’s
                    wholesale and production operations in March 2007 to HPL, to which I now
                    turn.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Space Constraint Problem at Greenwood Avenue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    With regards to the alleged problem of space
                    constraint at Greenwood Avenue, Ernst stated in his AEIC at paras 62-63:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the Company had in 2000 moved to its premises in Greenwood
                        Avenue, these were now seriously inadequate for the Company’s whole
                        range of retail and wholesale business as well as the manufacture of
                        sausages and processing of meat products. In addition, housed in the
                        premises was the retail outlet, an office and cold room/chiller to store
                        products. Apart from the Greenwood premises, the Company had also rented
                        storage facilities in Kallang for its raw and unprocessed meat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The company could not continue on this basis without acquiring new
                        premises, hiring more staff, buying more equipment and possibly opening a
                        factory all of which would greatly increase the Company’s costs and
                        overheads.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    At trial Ernst stated that the most
                    important reason for the cessation of wholesale business was the space
                    constraint problem at Greenwood Avenue. As discussed above, although Ernst was
                    viewing properties for a factory together with Ryan and Andre from January to
                    March 2006, which according to them was for SB’s purposes, there was no
                    evidence that he took any further step towards this end after March 2006. Yet,
                    about four mouths later, in July 2006, the Property was purchased by HPL using a
                    substantial financial contribution from Ernst. As stated above, Ryan admitted
                    that the Property purchased by HPL was also suitable for SB which according to
                    him, was still looking for a factory at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Although Ryan insisted that he did not
                    inform Ernst about the Property before he paid the deposit of $7,250 for the
                    option to purchase the Property,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> I do not accept this
                    evidence. Ernst had already provided the first $400,000 for HPL. Ryan was still
                    under employment in SB as its Deputy Managing Director and at that time, he was
                    staying with Ernst.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> Considering the amount of
                    time they spent with each other on a daily basis and Ernst’s earlier
                    financial support, Ryan must have consulted Ernst before the placement of the
                    deposit. Hence, if Ernst was acting <em>bona fide</em>, he
                    should have discussed with Alex and Don Foo about a possible acquisition of the
                    Property by SB in order to deal with the alleged space constraint problem. It is
                    not disputed that he did not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Accordingly, I am not convinced that the
                    alleged space constraint problem was a reason, much less the crucial reason for
                    the cessation of SB’s wholesale and production operations in March 2007.
                    If the problem existed, it could have been solved by SB acquiring the Property
                    but instead, Ernst contributed financially for HPL to do so. I now turn to the
                    other alleged reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fear of losing the AVA licence for Greenwood Avenue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Ernst stated that the fear that the AVA
                    would not renew SB’s licence for production at Greenwood Avenue was
                    another important reason for the cessation of SB’s wholesale and
                    production operations. He explained that the AVA would eventually not renew
                    SB’s licence as SB was not supposed to get the licence for Greenwood
                    Avenue because it was a residential area and that AVA had made an exception for
                        them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> In addition, whenever officers from AVA went to
                    Greenwood Avenue for inspection, they would ask him when he would stop the
                    production operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    However, apart from Ernst’s assertion,
                    there was no evidence that AVA had ever threatened not to renew SB’s
                    licence at Greenwood Avenue. Ernst did not call upon any officer from AVA to
                    give evidence. On the contrary, the AVA licence was renewed on 10 August
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> Indeed it was Ernst who first wrote a
                    letter to AVA to cancel the licence because SB had stopped the production
                    operation. He applied for a licence from the National Environment Agency
                    (“NEA”) instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> However, as
                    the application was more complicated and time-consuming than expected, he had no
                    choice but to renew the AVA licence first as SB could not operate without a
                        licence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    When asked to clarify his evidence, Ernst
                    was unable to give a convincing explanation:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Huber, I will very soon invite you to look
                            at the letter to AVA but right now, I stand on with the question first.
                            Is it your position that because there are problems from AVA, so that it
                            one of your reasons why you decided to cease wholesale
                        business?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There was no problem from AVA. It was no longer
                            required. If I understood your… question correctly.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When you say “it was no longer

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Court:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So this is the part, I think both of you have
                            to decide what the dispute is because you say, “No need to have
                            AVA because I stopped --- decided to stop
                        wholesale.”</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Court:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">But I thought your position is, one of the
                            reasons for stopping wholesale is because “I have problems with
                            AVA”.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">W:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It is… a reason in the sense that in the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Ryan had also admitted that the renewal of
                    the AVA licence at Greenwood Avenue was not an issue to SB:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Now would you the move on to the paragraph below
                            which says that licence has expired on 31 July.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Would you not agree with me that AVA renewed the licence 2 days after the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Would you therefore also accept that as of August

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    That means that AVA had no difficulties in issuing
                            the licence to you all. AVA did not see that AVA licence should not be
                            issued to Swiss Butchery. So my question to you, would you not agree
                            that as of 10<sup>th</sup> August 2007 --- or as of
                            August 2007, would you agree that AVA licence was not a problem to SB at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In the circumstances, I do not accept
                    Ernst’s evidence that the fear that the AVA licence would not be renewed
                    eventually was a reason for the cessation of SB’s production operation as
                    well as the wholesale operation. There was no reason to stop wholesale and
                    production operations in March 2007 when no dead-line to do so had been given by
                    AVA. Indeed, as already mentioned, the AVA licence was in fact renewed in August
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> In my view, Ernst had timed SB’s
                    cessation of the wholesale and production operations to coincide with
                    HPL’s commencement of operations. The possible non-renewal of the AVA
                    licence was an excuse in attempting to justify the diversion of SB’s
                    wholesale and production operations to HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ernst’s health problems and the continuity of SB’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The issues of Ernst’s health problems
                    and continuity of SB’s business should anything untoward happens to Ernst
                    were related. Ernst stated in his AEIC that in 2002, he underwent two cancer
                    operations and in 2007 he had another operation to have a stent inserted to
                    clear his blocked arteries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> The continuity
                    of SB’s business as a whole would be affected if he were incapacitated by
                    his health problems.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> He stated that being the “main
                    person” together with Thomas, there was no way that SB could have
                    operated at two different premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Whilst Ernst had correctly summarised his
                    health condition, it was, in my view, not a genuine reason for diverting the
                    wholesale and production operations to HPL. By so divesting, he had taken it out
                    of the hands of Alex and Don Foo to decide on what to do if his health was
                    really an issue to the continuity of SB’s entire operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relative profitability of retail business and wholesale
                business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In his AEIC, Ernst stated that SB had never
                    seriously developed its wholesale and production operations because the profit
                    margin for the retail operations was always higher than that for the wholesale
                        operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> However, as provided in the report of
                    Ernst’s expert witness, Mr Kon Yin Tong (“Mr Kon’s
                    Report”), in 2006, the Gross Profit margin of SB’s wholesale
                    operations was 34%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> Ernst admitted that this figure was
                        substantial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> SB’s expert witness, Mr Chee Yoh
                    Chuang, used the figures provided in Mr Kon’s Report and computed the
                    Profit Margin after direct expenses for SB’s wholesale operations to be
                    19.7% which was only slightly lower than that for retail operation which had a
                    figure of 20.9%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> In addition, Ernst had
                    admitted that the wholesale operation contributed substantially to SB’s
                    overall revenue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    When faced with the various figures which
                    undeniably showed the profitability of SB’s wholesale operations, Ernst
                    had to state that the figures were not much of a consideration when he decided
                    that SB should cease its wholesale operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> In my view, the issue of
                    relative profitability between retail and wholesale operations was a red herring
                    by Ernst.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Competition with other players in the wholesale business
                industry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The point about competition was linked to
                    the issue of relative profitability. Ernst testified that SB was the leader in
                    the retail business of butchery in Singapore whereas in wholesale, there were
                    more competitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> Hence when he had to decide the future of SB, he
                    chose to focus on retail and to cease wholesale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Ernst in cross-examination stated that he
                    had difficulties in getting reliable staff to run the wholesale and production
                    operations in SB and that was one reason for the cessation of these
                        businesses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> This seemed to be inconsistent with the position
                    adopted in his AEIC where he appeared to consider the shortage of reliable staff
                    only in the context of SB’s retail operation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> Under further cross-examination, Ernst also
                    admitted that given the greater number of competitors in the wholesale market,
                    there would be many experienced staff available.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> Even though he tried to
                    qualify his evidence by saying that he needed more than just good salespersons
                    because wholesale and production operations went together, he had to eventually
                    concede that the lack of reliable staff was not a reason for the cessation of
                    wholesale and production operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The question of not having adequate and
                    qualified manpower was also a reason given by Ernst regarding space constraint.
                    His point was that there was no point in acquiring the Property for SB because
                    SB no longer had the services of Ryan and Andre who had tendered their
                    resignation. He gave the impression that Ryan and Andre were indispensable to
                    the continuation of expansion of SB’s wholesale and production operations.
                    I do not accept this suggestion. Although Ryan and Andre had helped out in SB
                    during their local student days, their full-time employment with SB was for a
                    short duration only. While I do not mean to trivialise their contributions, they
                    were not as indispensable as Ernst made them out to be. Also there was no
                    concrete evidence to show who he had sought to recruit as their replacements or
                    that he had had difficulties with recruitment generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Another factor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Apart from rejecting the reasons discussed
                    above, I have considered another factor which showed that Ernst caused SB to
                    cease its wholesale and production operations based not on a strategic business
                    decision but in furtherance of his plan to wrongfully divert SB’s
                    operations to HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    It is true that Ernst was removed as
                    Managing Director and director in January 2008 but there was no evidence that
                    Ernst had tried to improve on SB’s retail operations between the time of
                    cessation of SB’s wholesale operations in March 2007 and his removal in
                    January 2008. In fact, even back in October 2006, when the opportunity to open a
                    retail shop in NTUC Finest arose for SB, Ernst chose to give up the opportunity
                    and instead provided HPL with the opportunity. I will elaborate on this 2006
                    opportunity with NTUC Fairprice. As mentioned above, Ernst said he decided not
                    to pursue this opportunity because in 2001, SB had rejected an earlier proposal
                    from NTUC Fairprice to open an SB outlet in one of its supermarkets. His reason
                    was that when he had raised the question in 2001 with Alex and Don Foo, he had
                    been criticised for considering the opportunity as it was merely an attempt by
                    NTUC Fairprice then to learn the business operation of SB. Don Foo’s
                    version was that Ernst was asked to pursue the matter then but nothing further
                    was heard from Ernst. Even if I accepted Ernst’s version, the proposal
                    from NTUC in 2006 was in respect of its premium supermarket NTUC Finest (as
                    compared to an ordinary NTUC Fairprice supermarket) and was made five years
                        later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> He should at least have broached the subject
                    with Alex and Don Foo in 2006 and given them the opportunity to reject it.
                    Instead he passed the opportunity immediately to Ryan and Andre whilst leading
                    NTUC Fairprice to believe, at least initially, that Ryan and Andre were also
                    representing SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In the circumstances, I do not accept that
                    Ernst made a strategic decision in the <em>bona fide</em>
                    interests of SB when he divested the wholesale and production operations to HPL.
                    He did so in breach of his duties as a director and in conspiracy with the
                    second to fifth defendant, using unlawful means as set out above and below to do
                    so, with the intention to injure SB and profit HPL and his family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged ratification by other shareholders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    It is undisputed that Ernst did not have any
                    prior discussion with Alex and Don Foo about the divestment of the wholesale and
                    production operations of SB. Ernst claimed that after the divestment, he did
                    tell both of them in a coffee-shop meeting and also told them that SB would be
                    purchasing (products) from “Huber’s”, although he did not
                    tell them that HPL was owned by Ryan and Andre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span> However they remained
                    silent and Ernst took it that they had consented to his decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    It was also suggested by Ernst, Ryan and
                    Andre that the children of Alex and Don Foo would have known about Ryan’s
                    and Andre’s business, HPL, as they were reasonably close to each other and
                    would have told their parents about the same. Indeed, Ryan said that he was
                    obtaining a personal loan from a bank through Mark Foo and he had to disclose
                    his employment by HPL at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Don Foo’s version was that he and Alex
                    did not hear about the divestment directly from Ernst. They learned a little
                    about it from talk about Ryan and Andre’s business at the weekly
                    gatherings (which Ernst had ceased to attend) and from monthly accounts which
                    they received. The accounts showed credit sales to be declining. They suspected
                    something was up and that was why Don Foo’s son, Mark Foo left his
                    employment with Credit Suisse on 27 May 2007 to join Foo &amp; Associates first
                    with the intention of eventually joining SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I am of the view that Ernst did not directly
                    tell Alex and Don Foo about the divestment. If he had really wanted to keep them
                    informed, he would have discussed with them before the deed was done. Any
                    knowledge that they acquired indirectly whether through the weekly gatherings,
                    their children or accounts and their lack of objection thereafter do not amount
                    to a ratification of what Ernst (and his sons) had done. The reliance by Ernst
                    on <em>Eng Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck and Ors</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 241 (“<em>Eng Gee Seng</em>”)
                    that inactivity or silence can amount to ratification is unjustified in the
                    circumstances before me. As stated in [34] of <em>Eng Gee
                        Seng</em>, in order for a person to be held to have ratified an
                    unauthorised act, it is necessary that at the time of ratification, he should
                    have full knowledge of all the material circumstances in which the act was done,
                    unless he intended to ratify and take the risk whatever the circumstances may
                    have been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In this case, all that Alex and Don Foo had
                    was incomplete information about the divestment of business to HPL through the
                    “loose talk” at the weekly gatherings and the monthly statements.
                    Although they had suspicions, this did not constitute full knowledge of the
                    divestment. In any event, they were not inactive but making their own plans for
                    they must have realised that Ernst could not be trusted to act in SB’s
                    interest. In the circumstances, <em>Eng Gee Seng</em> is of
                    no assistance to Ernst.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Business Times article</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In August 2007, HPL commenced operations at
                    NTUC Finest. In a Business Times article (“the BT Article”)
                    published on 18 August 2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> it was stated thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sales Director, Andre, 27, is quick to clarify that Huber’s is an
                        independent company and has nothing to do with his father’s company.
                        “Swiss Butchery is run by my father but the company has two other
                        shareholders. There have been many people asking why there’s been a
                        change in company name. Simply put, the other two shareholders in Swiss
                        Butchery do not want Ryan and me in the business. Since that was the case,
                        we started our own company Huber’s Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    This BT article stated clearly that SB and
                    HPL were separate companies unlike the other occasions which I elaborated on
                    above. It seemed to me that the interview given for this article was calculated
                    to give the impression that Ryan and Andre had done all that they could to
                    disassociate themselves from SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Letter sent after the BT article </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    After the BT Article was published, Alex and
                    Don Foo prepared a letter dated 29 August 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> and addressed to Ernst<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> in which they
                    put a disclaimer for signing the audited account of SB for the year 2006. In the
                    letter, it was highlighted that Ernst had given unilateral approval for related
                    party transactions and directors’ close family members appointment,
                    salaries and bonus and that Alex and Don Foo would require further clarification
                    on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A talk and tour for the Swiss Association of Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In December 2007, the Swiss Association of
                    Singapore (“SAS”) had a tour for its members at the Property.
                    Ernst in his AEIC stated that a few days before the tour, he had been approached
                    by the representative of SAS, Ms Luzia Kappeller to give a talk on the
                    “Swiss Butchery” story and that before the tour, he gave an
                    account of how SB was started. He denied that he conducted the tour thereafter
                    or gave any talk for the benefit of HPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    He elaborated in cross-examination that on
                    the morning of the tour at the HPL factory, he gave the talk on the upper floor
                    in the meeting room about the history of SB and that was his part. After that,
                    the members of the SAS went downstairs for the tour of the HPL
                        factory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> However, it was unbelievable that Ernst would go
                    to HPL’s factory to give a talk on SB if he truly wanted to disassociate
                    SB from HPL. In my view, the talk given to the SAS was again to mislead others
                    that HPL was related to SB. This view was fortified when one considers the SAS
                    newsletter for January/February 2008 on its website.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> An article on
                    the tour was headlined “Visit to Huber’s Pte Ltd aka Swiss Butchery
                    Factory”. This clearly showed the misconception held by the SAS after
                    they visited the Property for the factory tour. Ernst said that this was a
                    genuine mistake but in my view it was not so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The circumstances leading to the removal of Ernst as managing

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In August 2007, Don Foo approached Walter

                    stated that his employment would commence on 2 January 2008. As pointed out
                    by counsel, the letter of appointment was issued by Alex even though Ernst was

                    at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Don Foo admitted under cross-examination
                    that they had appointed Schiele without Ernst’s knowledge so that they
                    could start a production facility for SB without any disruption in the normal
                    operation of SB especially during the busy Christmas season.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> The appointment
                    of Schiele was thus part of a plan to remove Ernst from SB after Alex and Don
                    Foo found out about HPL’s retail outlet in NTUC Finest<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> and Schiele’s role would be to assist in
                    the management of SB’s business after Alex and Don Foo took over the
                    management of SB’s operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span> In his letter of
                    appointment, Schiele would be entitled to a 20% shareholding in a new subsidiary
                    company SBFI which was incorporated on 12 October 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></span> The 20%
                    shareholding was to provide him with the incentive to join SBFI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    As stated, Alex and Don Foo intended to
                    recommence wholesale and production operations for SB and SBFI was to be the
                    business vehicle for the acquisition of a production facility. The incorporation
                    of SBFI was therefore a decision made in the interest of SB. This is in
                    contradistinction to the incorporation of HPL which was to usurp SB’s
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Don Foo admitted that they had started
                    looking for a production facility for the purposes of SBFI from the date of its
                    incorporation and on 4 January 2008, SB sent out an official
                        notice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span> to its employees stating, <em>inter alia</em>, the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Swiss Butchery have the resources, a newly owned and well equipped 3
                        storey factory building with the latest and most advanced manufacturing

                        level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Don Foo testified that the announcement was incorrect in that
                    on 4 January 2008, SB had not yet purchased the factory, he said that they
                    had the intention to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In the meantime, as stated above, Don Foo
                    was appointed as an additional director of SB on 27 December 2007. He
                    admitted that the real reason for his appointment was so that there would be
                    five directors on the Board of Directors of SB and that Alex, Don Foo and his
                    wife would have a majority vote as against Ernst and his wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span> On
                    2 January 2008, at a directors’ meeting, the Board of Directors of SB
                    terminated the employment of Ernst as the Managing Director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span> A notice dated
                    2 January 2008 for convening an Extraordinary General Meeting

                    held on 18 January 2008, Ernst was removed as a director of SB together
                    with his wife. Ernst then commenced the action in Suit No. 222 on 31 March
                    2008 against SB as well as Alex, Don Foo and his wife for relief against
                    minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act. SB in turn commenced Suit
                    No. 245 on 7 April 2008 against the defendants in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Ernst’s position was that Alex and Don
                    Foo had planned to get rid of him and had used the divestment of the wholesale
                    and production operations as the excuse to do so even though they had ratified
                    that decision. As I have said, I find that there was no such ratification and it
                    was Ernst and others who had wronged SB (and the other
                shareholders).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It was also suggested that there was no
                    reason for Ernst to harm SB as he was holding one-third of its equity. In my
                    view, Ernst was already making other plans. He knew his future no longer lay
                    with SB after the Share Issue Proposal and Share Purchase Proposal were
                    rejected. The way forward for him was HPL which his family would have full
                    control of, whether through one son or two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    It was also suggested that Ernst’s
                    conduct was not covert and that this militated against any suggestion of a
                    conspiracy. In my view, some of Ernst’s conduct was covert like his
                    involvement with HPL. The acquisition of the wholesale and production operations
                    surfaced only later and also not directly. True, discussions with staff were in
                    the open but not discussions with third parties, <em>eg</em>, NTUC Fairprice. I have elaborated on other third parties
                    above. I am of the view that Ernst was more frustrated and bold than wise and
                    the evidence points overwhelmingly to a breach of his duties as a director of SB
                    and a conspiracy as already mentioned.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Apart from SB’s main claim for
                    wrongful diversion of its operations to HPL, it made several subsidiary claims

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sale of SB’s MADO mincer and transfer of other equipment to
                HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    On 21 March 2007, Ernst caused SB to
                    sell its MADO Mincer to HPL for $5,000. Ernst stated that he sold the Mado
                    Mincer because after the cessation of SB’s wholesale and production
                    operations, it had no further use for the Mado Mincer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span> With regards to this issue, one Mr Lim
                    Kiat Huat (“Mr Lim”), a director of Zenia Singapore Pte Ltd
                    which is the agent for the MADO brand of industrial machines, stated in his AEIC
                    that SB’s MADO Mincer was worth about 30% of its purchase price of
                        $18,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    There is no reason to reject that valuation
                    by Mr Lim. However, the sale of SB’s MADO Mincer was a consequence of
                    the wrongful divestment of the wholesale and production operations which cannot
                    be justified even though SB had obtained a fair value for the
                sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The other equipment alleged to have been
                    transferred by SB to HPL include a stainless steel smoke trolley with stainless
                    steel trays, a small trolley, baskets, trays, moulds for hams, coloured plastic
                    containers (“the Other Equipment”). The stainless steel smoke
                    trolley has since been returned by HPL on 28 February 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span> Ernst’s evidence was that the trays
                    and moulds were borrowed by HPL since they were not used by SB after the change
                    in the business model and were taking up space in SB. An agreement was reached
                    between him and Ryan for the sale of the moulds and the containers by barter
                        trade.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span> There was insufficient evidence
                    of this barter trade. In any event, like the MADO Mincer, the Other Equipment
                    transferred to HPL was because of a wrongful divestment of SB’s wholesale
                    and production operations and thus cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sale of SB’s lorry to HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    SB claimed that Ernst caused SB to sell its
                    lorry with Registration No. YL6642Z (“SB’s Lorry”) to HPL at
                    an undervalue and on unduly favourable credit terms. Ernst’s evidence was
                    that he had reminded Alex and Don that SB’s Lorry was to be sold to HPL
                    because SB had stopped its wholesale and production operations. However, Don Foo
                    testified that on August 2007, Ernst informed the directors of SB that the
                    Singapore Land Transport Authority required SB’s Lorry to be sold and
                        scrapped.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span> Further, the directors’ resolution which
                    purported to ratify the sale of SB’s Lorry made no mention of the fact
                    that it was to be sold to HPL. All that was stated was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was resolved that Mr Huber Ernst, … be hereby authorised to
                        conduct request for Transaction Pin/Application of De-Registration /
                        Transfer of Vehicle Ownership / PARF and or COE Rebate for an on behalf of
                        the Compnay and also be authorised to sign, initial, accept or execute all
                        documents in connection with the transaction vehicle no.: YL
                            6642Z.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Don Foo stated that SB’s Lorry was
                    purchased in 2004 at a total price of about $60,000 inclusive of the
                    refrigerator unit installed at the back of SB’s Lorry. The purchase price
                    of SB’s Lorry itself was $43,000 and that for the refrigerator unit was
                        $18,500.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    SB’s Lorry was sold together with the
                    refrigerator unit to HPL at a price of $25,000 in 2007. Although Ernst called
                    upon Mr Beh Kok Hwa (“Mr Beh”) to give evidence that the
                    value of SB’s Lorry at the time of sale to HPL was about $23,000 to
                    $24,000, Mr Beh admitted that his assessment was based on a sale to a
                    second-hand dealer and a direct sale between a seller and purchaser would fetch
                    a higher price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span> His assessment was also premised on the basis
                    that the refrigerator unit had no value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In my view, Mr Beh’s assessment
                    was not justifiable. In any event the sale of SB’s Lorry to HPL, just like
                    the sale of the Mando Mincer, was unjustified as it was part of the plan for the
                    divestment of SB’s operations to HPL. Indeed it was Ernst’s position
                    that when those operations had been divested there was no longer any need for
                    SB’s Lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subletting of cold-room facilities from HPL to SB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    SB’s complaint for this issue was that
                    Ernst had terminated SB’s existing cold room rental at AIS Building for
                    $2800 per month in May 2007 and through HPL, Ernst had arranged for SB to sublet
                    other cold room facilities from HPL for $2,675 from June 2007 to May 2008,
                    thereby effectively paying for HPL’s own cost of their own cold room
                        facilities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span> Ernst’s version
                    was that he had saved some money for SB. It seems to me that Ernst could not
                    make up his mind whether to treat HPL at arm’s length or not. He should
                    have as it was really a competitor of SB notwithstanding explanations that HPL
                    was targeting a different market from SB’s. In any event, no damage was
                    caused to SB for this arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ernst’s help in obtaining meat supplies for HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    With respect to this allegation, although
                    Ernst admitted that he visited suppliers in Switzerland and Australia with Ryan
                    and Andre in November 2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span> his
                    explanation was that he went on such trips for the purposes of SB whereas Ryan
                    and Andre went for the purposes of HPL. SB’s counsel did not challenge
                    this position in cross-examination and so I would have to accept
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Supplying meat samplers for free to Andre for HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    According to Tan KW’s evidence, Andre
                    would obtain meat samplers from SB at Greenwood Avenue and that Thomas had
                    allowed Andre to obtain the meat samplers for free. I accept Tan KW’s
                    evidence that he was instructed by Thomas on two separate occasions to throw the
                    order chit away.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span> In my view, if Thomas had intended for HPL to
                    pay for the meat samplers, there would have been no reason to throw away the
                    order chit. Further, although Andre adduced several invoices to show that HPL
                    had paid for the meat samplers, Tan KW was certain that those invoices were not
                    for meat samplers as the weight of the products reflected in the invoices
                    exceeded those of meat samplers and also there were items which he had
                    personally packed but were missing in those invoices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span> Hence, I find
                    that HPL had improperly obtained meat samplers for free from SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    With regards to this claim, Thomas did not
                    allege to have been instructed by Ernst to give HPL free samplers. He had
                    provided the free samplers on his own accord to favour HPL wrongfully and
                    accordingly, I find him liable for dishonest assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purchasing inferior quality meat products from HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    SB’s witness, Tan HH, stated that
                    throughout 2007, SB purchased large quantity of inferior quality meat including
                    end cuts and meat trimmings from HPL. These end cuts and meat trimmings were of
                    low value and difficult to sell. He further testified that the meat purchased
                    from HPL were not fresh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_177" id="Ftn_177_1"><sup>[note: 177]</sup></a></span> However, he conceded that
                    end cuts are not completely useless and may be used towards preparing products
                    such as marinated fillet, stir-fried beef and beef shaslik. Tan HH also admitted
                    that Thomas’ instructions to SB’s employees to package the end cuts
                    in small portions or to marinate them so that they can last longer were
                        reasonable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_178" id="Ftn_178_1"><sup>[note: 178]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    As for Tan KW, he stated in his AEIC that
                    after March 2007, SB would receive meat trimmings from HPL. As the meat
                    trimmings consist of fats around the meat, end cuts and other parts of the meat
                    which were odd-shaped, they were not marketable. Prior to HPL’s
                    commencement of its production operations in March 2007, SB had never purchased
                    meat trimmings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Thomas did not dispute that SB had purchased
                    end cuts although he insisted that SB did not purchase meat
                        trimmings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_179" id="Ftn_179_1"><sup>[note: 179]</sup></a></span> He testified that end cuts were not inferior
                    meat and SB used them for its meat products such as the marinated beef fillet
                    with bacon which was popular amongst SB’s customers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_180" id="Ftn_180_1"><sup>[note: 180]</sup></a></span> After SB
                    stopped its wholesale and production operations, it purchased the end-cuts from
                    HPL because Ernst had obtained a 10% discount from the latter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_181" id="Ftn_181_1"><sup>[note: 181]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In a particular invoice for products
                    purchased by SB from HPL, Thomas wrote the following sentence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pls try not to send Beef Cheeks, hardly anybody buys.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_182" id="Ftn_182_1"><sup>[note: 182]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Don Foo stated that this sentence meant that
                    HPL had been sending certain items to SB without any order for those items and
                    those items had been accepted by Thomas. I agree. Thomas had caused SB to
                    purchase or to accept inferior quality product from HPL. Putting aside the issue
                    of end cuts, I accept the evidence of Tan HH and Tan KW that SB had purchased
                    meat trimmings from HPL, which as admitted by Thomas, were of no value and also
                    that some of the meat purchased from HPL was not fresh. However this allegation
                    pertained to Thomas and not Ernst.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Removal of SB’s recipe book and home delivery book by
                Thomas</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    SB claimed that SB’s Recipe Book and
                    Home Delivery Book went missing after the new management took over on
                    3 January 2008 and that they were removed by Thomas. SB further alleged
                    that the closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) in the premises at
                    Greenwood Avenue was frequently switched off during the month of January 2008
                    when Thomas was still under employment at SB. Presumably on one of those
                    occasions, Thomas must have removed the Home Delivery Book and Recipe
                    Book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The Home Delivery Book contained records of
                    SB’s customers, such as their names, addresses, the items purchased and
                    the price of the items purchased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_183" id="Ftn_183_1"><sup>[note: 183]</sup></a></span> The contents of
                    the Recipe Book were disputed. Tan HH alleged that the Recipe Book contained
                    information on the recipes used by the SB staff such as the different types of
                    ingredients used.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_184" id="Ftn_184_1"><sup>[note: 184]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, Thomas
                    claimed that the Recipe Book contained information on daily recipes recorded by
                        him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_185" id="Ftn_185_1"><sup>[note: 185]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    After considering the evidence, I find that
                    the allegation against Thomas has not been sufficiently made out. First, the
                    SB’s employees (both former and existing) called upon to give evidence
                    were unable to testify that they saw Thomas removing specifically the Recipe
                    Book and Home Delivery Book. For instance, Yeow JT could only state in his AEIC
                    that he saw Thomas remove two books from SB’s counter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_186" id="Ftn_186_1"><sup>[note: 186]</sup></a></span> Further, under cross-examination, Yeow
                    JT stated that the books allegedly taken by Thomas were hardcover books and did
                    not look like the mock copy of the Recipe Book which was produced by SB. Most
                    importantly, there is no evidence that Thomas took the books, if he did, out of
                    the premises of Greenwood Avenue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Given the less than satisfactory nature of
                    the evidence on this issue, I am unable to accept SB’s allegation that
                    Thomas had removed SB’s Recipe Book and Home Delivery Book for the
                    benefits of HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inducing or attempting to induce employees to terminate their
                contracts with SB to join HB/HPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    SB claimed that at the weekly Saturday
                    briefings held at Greenwood Avenue, Ernst and Thomas led SB’s then
                    existing employees to believe that SB and HPL were related companies
                    ‘under the same roof’. This created a belief in the minds of some of
                    SB’s employees that HPL and SB were related companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_187" id="Ftn_187_1"><sup>[note: 187]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    As stated by Tan KW during

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    My understanding at that point of time, okay,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Yeow JT stated at para 6 of his AEIC
                    that in early 2007, the staff were informed during one of the Saturday briefings
                    that SB would be closing down its production at Greenwood Avenue and that the
                    employees in the production line would be transferred to the factory at 161
                    Pandan Loop. He was under the impression that HPL was a subsidiary of SB and
                    that HPL was somehow linked to SB. Under cross-examination, Yeow JT gave the
                    following evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    All right. My instructions are that the line that
                            you have there, “that the employees in the production line would
                            be transferred to the factory at 161 Pandan Loop”; that was never
                            said at this briefing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Whether this word “transferred” was

                            there’s another outlet coming up in Pandan Loop and doing the same
                            thing as what --- what the department is going to be closed down, the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    SB provided a list of former SB’s
                    employees who joined HPL from March 2007 to February 2008. These employees were
                    Eunice Ooi, Lee Chee Hiong, Mike Tan Liong Peow, Liang Soon Hwa and Ng Chung
                    Khai. However, they were not called upon to give evidence on the circumstances
                    surrounding their departure from SB. But SB did call Gregory Mark Hughes
                    (“Gregory”), who was allegedly approached by HPL whilst working
                    for SB, to give evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Gregory stated in his AEIC that in June
                        2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_190" id="Ftn_190_1"><sup>[note: 190]</sup></a></span> he visited SB at Greenwood
                    Avenue to look for a job. Shortly after, Ernst called him for an interview at
                    Greenwood Avenue. He subsequently attended another interview with Ernst at 161
                    Pandan Loop. Although Ernst had told him that SB, HPL and HB were not related,
                    Ernst said he was aware that most people would assume that the three companies
                    were related.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_191" id="Ftn_191_1"><sup>[note: 191]</sup></a></span> At
                    the second meeting, Ernst offered him the managerial post at the upcoming
                    butchery outlet at NTUC Finest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_192" id="Ftn_192_1"><sup>[note: 192]</sup></a></span> Although Gregory verbally
                    agreed to the offer, he did not sign the employment contract and was instead
                    employed by SB in August 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_193" id="Ftn_193_1"><sup>[note: 193]</sup></a></span> Gregory’s explanation
                    was that after he was offered the managerial post at NTUC Finest, Ernst told him
                    that the then-operation supervisor of SB had asked if he could be given the
                    opportunity to manage the butchery outlet at NTUC Finest, which meant that there
                    was a vacancy at SB and which was thus offered to Gregory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_194" id="Ftn_194_1"><sup>[note: 194]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Gregory also stated that he approached
                    Thomas in January 2008 after the new management took over the running of SB and
                    the latter told him that he should not stay with SB anymore as the new
                    management had no experience in running the business. At around that time,
                    Thomas also showed Gregory an SMS from Ernst asking if he was willing to join
                    HPL and HB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_195" id="Ftn_195_1"><sup>[note: 195]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Although Gregory’s evidence was
                    disputed in trial, I accept his account of the events. At the material time,
                    Ernst was still the managing director at SB. He had no business in conducting
                    job interviews for HPL. This job interview was thus part of his plan to divert
                    SB’s wholesale and production operations to HPL and to set up a retail
                    outlet for HPL. I will say more about Thomas later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Use of SB’s funds for Ernst’s personal expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    SB claimed in its pleading that EH had used
                    SB’s funds to pay for his personal expenses which were not part of his
                    employment agreement, nor incurred in the course of or for the purpose of
                    SB’s business for the period 1 January 2005 to 31 December
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_196" id="Ftn_196_1"><sup>[note: 196]</sup></a></span> However, this head of claim has been
                    abandoned by SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application of the Legal Principles </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    In my judgment, based on the above finding
                    of facts, both Ernst and Ryan had breached their fiduciary duties owed to SB and
                    had also engaged in a conspiracy to injure SB. After the rejection by Alex and
                    Don Foo of Ernst’s bid to obtain the majority shareholding in SB through
                    the Share Issue Proposal and Share Purchase Proposal, they embarked on a series
                    of steps to injure SB. They did this by diverting SB’s wholesale and
                    production operations to HPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    By usurping the business opportunity for SB
                    to open a retail butchery outlet at NTUC Finest for the benefit of HB (which as
                    stated above, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of HPL), Ernst again preferred his
                    personal interests over those of SB. This opportunity came to SB while Ernst was
                    still the managing director of SB and the exploitation of that opportunity
                    constitutes a breach of Ernst’s fiduciary duties (see <em>CMS Dolphin</em>) and was also a step in the overall conspiracy to
                    injure SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Both Ryan and Andre were involved in the
                    plan to divest SB’s wholesale and production operations to HPL. For Ryan,
                    his role began from the incorporation of HPL in September 2005 when he was
                    registered as the Managing Director and sole shareholder of HPL with $100,000
                    start-up capital. The incorporation of HPL as the business vehicle to facilitate
                    the divestment of SB’s wholesale and production operations was a clear
                    breach of his duty of loyalty owed to SB while he was still employed as its
                    Deputy Managing Director. Similarly, the purchase of the Property for HPL in
                    July 2006 was another instance of a breach of his fiduciary duties. As for
                    Andre, his participation began when he returned from Australia in January 2006
                    and became registered as a 50% shareholder of HPL in March 2006. I find that the
                    three of them were clearly part of the plan to cause injury or damage to SB. The
                    various acts leading to the divestment such as the purchase of the Property and
                    misleading others of the relationship between SB and HPL are undoubtedly acts
                    done in furtherance of the plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    As stated above, HPL is jointly-owned by
                    Ryan and Andre and HB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HPL. HPL was set up as the
                    business vehicle to usurp SB’s wholesale and production operations. HB was
                    set up to run the retail outlet at NTUC Finest after usurping the business
                    opportunity meant for SB. At all material times, Ryan and Andre formed the
                    effective management of HPL and HB. As held in <em>Cook v
                        Deeks</em> [1916] AC 554 at 565, where the directors of a
                    company had wrongfully diverted business belonging to the company to another
                    company, the latter company would be liable to account for the profits to the
                    first company. Accordingly, both HPL and HB, being the business vehicles used
                    for the usurpation of SB’s business, are liable to account for the profits
                    to SB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Thomas</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    As for Thomas, I note that the allegations
                    made by SB against Thomas in relation to the tort of conspiracy are far less
                    comprehensive as compared to the other defendants. The main paragraphs in the
                    statement of claim pertaining to the claim of tort of conspiracy are paras

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    There was no evidence that Thomas had been
                    part of the conspiracy to divert SB’s wholesale and production operations
                    and to set up HPL to compete with SB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_200" id="Ftn_200_1"><sup>[note: 200]</sup></a></span> Further, it is not disputed
                    that Thomas has no shareholding in either HPL or HB. Bearing in mind the high
                    burden of proof imposed on SB to establish that Thomas was part of a conspiracy,
                    I find that the evidence is insufficient to establish that Thomas had been part
                    of the conspiracy between Ernst, Ryan and Andre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    However, this is not the end of the matter.
                    The other claim against Thomas rests upon the allegation of dishonest
                    assistance. As stated above, the law in this area has been clarified by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>George Raymond Zage III</em> where
                    the objective test of honesty was accepted. A defendant will be liable for
                    dishonest assistance if he has knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the
                    transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of
                    standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    As regards the removal of the Home Delivery
                    Book and Recipe Book, I have concluded that SB has failed to establish that
                    Thomas removed them from Greenwood Avenue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    As for the re-direction of wholesale orders
                    for SB to HPL and instructing SB’s employees to inform SB’s
                    customers to go to HB’s counter at NTUC Finest when SB was closed, I am
                    prepared to give Thomas the benefit of the doubt that he was merely following
                    Ernst’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    As for inducing SB’s employees to
                    terminate their employment contracts with SB and join HPL, the evidence against
                    Thomas was vague as to whether he was merely following Ernst’s
                    instructions or he had done more to encourage SB’s employees to move to
                    HPL. The burden of proof is on SB and I find that SB has not discharged its
                    burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    However, owing to his role in supplying free
                    meat samplers to Andre and the purchase of inferior quality meat products from
                    HPL, I find that Thomas has acted dishonestly. Given his position that he was
                    clear about the fact that SB and HPL were separate and independent
                        entities,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_201" id="Ftn_201_1"><sup>[note: 201]</sup></a></span> he must have known that Andre and hence HPL
                    ought not to have been given free samplers. He also ought to have rejected
                    inferior quality meat products from HPL. Nevertheless, there is no separate
                    claim for damages for these allegations which were made to support the overall
                    allegation that he was a party to the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    There is also a counterclaim by Thomas for
                    $15,653 being unpaid salary and compensation for leave. This was not disputed by
                    SB. There was also a claim for knowing receipt against Andre, HB, HPL and Thomas
                    but it is not necessary for me to deal with that in the
                circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    I grant judgment against the first to fifth
                    defendants in Suit 245 for damages to be assessed or an account for profits,
                    with interest and costs of the assessment or accounting to be determined by the
                    Registrar. I make no order on the claim against Thomas. I grant judgment for
                    Thomas against SB for $15,653 and interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of
                    his counterclaim to the date of judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    I will hear the parties on costs of the
                    action up to and including the date of my judgment.</p>
