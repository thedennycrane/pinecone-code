On 15 March 2017, Wei commenced this action (“the Suit”) against them under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”), claiming that they had acted in a manner that was unfair, oppressive or prejudicial to him. The Company is a nominal defendant. On 5 May 2020, the Defendants applied to wind up the Company on the basis that it was insolvent and unable to pay its debts.

In Suit 446/2016 (“Suit 446”), commenced by Seah against the Company to claim monies owed to him, the Defendants (who acted for the Company) pleaded that “The directors … were equal shareholders who were working together in a joint enterprise for mutual profit.”

This was followed up with an email on 23 January 2015 sent by his representative Song Chumei (“Ms Song”) to enquire about the status of the registration of his shares and whether his directorship had been reflected in the share certificate. It is also supported by the 24 Jan 2015 Email from Low (the contents of which Sim agreed to in court) pertaining to the assurance given by all shareholders that each shareholder would be able to appoint a director (see [18] above).

The Defendants did not tell him to sign the 2015 Resolution of which he received an unsigned copy in February 2016 and he had the impression from looking at it that he would be paid his share of US$1.5 million.

</div> Wei also did not assert in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that he had agreed to the 2015 Resolution or decision taken therein by the Defendants after he discovered that they had declared the Dividends and paid themselves. That Wei “thought” he would be paid US$1.5 million from the Dividends after he saw the documents sent around <span class="font-italic">16</span> <span class="font-italic">February 2016</span> to Ms Song, is equivocal. At that time, Wei was unaware that the 2015 Resolution (upon which the declaration and payment of the Dividends were premised) was not made in conformity with the Articles. Hence, there could have been no assent to or a waiver of the irregularity by Wei. Likewise, that Wei had prayed for the Defendants to pay him his entitlement to US$1.5 million does not signify the validation of the irregularity in the 2015 Resolution. Such relief was prayed for only in July 2020 after the Company had been wound up, as an alternative to the relief that the Defendants repay the Company the dividends paid to them.

</div> It is also telling that a substantial sum of US$800,000 each were paid out to Low and Sim and clearly benefitted only them, at the cost of diminishing the Company’s assets. Further, the Defendants’ claim that HSBC wanted them to declare dividends to set off the loans “as soon as possible after receiving the [bank] facility” is unbelievable as HSBC extended the facility to the Company in November 2014 and the purported clearing of the directors’ debts only occurred more than a year later when the Dividends were declared in December 2015.

This gives the impression that the bonuses had not been declared even in late January 2015 and contradicts their position that the bonuses were approved at the 2014 EGM.

Whilst Low claimed that item 6 concerning “staff” bonuses referred also to directors, this was contradicted by Sim who stated that ever since the Company was incorporated in 2005 no shareholders’ or directors’ meetings have been held to declare such bonuses. Sim then claimed that the Big Bonuses were not declared via a resolution but merely by a “verbal agreement”.

In that email, Sim attached the Company’s profit and loss statement from January to June 2015, which recorded directors’ bonuses of US$567,742.28 and US$504,726.48 paid to Low and Sim respectively. However, the Big Bonuses were not brought to Wei’s or Ms Song’s attention and the email did not mention that that the bonuses reflected therein were for work done in 2014.

The Defendants had also attempted to conceal the payment from Wei, by the manner of accounting for the Big Bonuses and by ignoring Mr Song’s query about them. Finally, there was no good reason to pay such large bonuses to the Defendants allegedly for work done in 2014 when the Company’s net profits had dropped drastically in that year and when Sim claimed that he was not involved in the Company’s management. The Defendants had thus acted unfairly to Wei in relation to the Big Bonuses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">FY2015 Bonus</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In closing submissions, Wei argues that the modest one-month bonus given to him in FY2015 was disproportionate to the sales for that year, which was the highest yearly record of US$93 million, with profits between US$3.8 million and US$5 million, and retained earnings between US$6 million and US$11 million. He argues that this was an attempt to deny him a share of the Company’s profits.

This is corroborated by Tan and is consistent with the Company’s profit and loss statement for FY2015 which recorded the payments as for “personal tax”, which must mean that they were for taxes on income in the preceding year, 2014. Further, the Defendants had not breached Art 75 of the Articles that requires the remuneration of directors to be “from time to time determined by the Company in general meeting”.

</div> It was undisputed that the shareholders had, in 2006, decided that their taxes be borne by the Company every year. This assent was as binding as a resolution in general meeting (see <span class="font-italic">Duomatic</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41] above). Article 75 only requires this decision to be revisited from “time to time”. Hence there was no need to seek Wei’s consent on these payments when he came on board or to revisit this decision yearly. Even if Wei’s consent should have been obtained in 2015, it is not shown that the Defendants had deliberately kept him in the dark pertaining to the 2015 Directors’ Benefits. The manner of treating such payments was agreed in 2006 and they could have simply forgotten to update Wei at the material time. Notably, Wei did not explain nor elaborate on this issue in his AEIC. Finally, I make no findings concerning the 2015 Directors’ Benefit paid to Teo. This was not pleaded and the Defendants were not cross-examined specifically on this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">2018/2019 Salaries and the Defendants’ salary increments for FY2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In closing submissions, Wei submits that the 2018/2019 Salaries were decided without his knowledge. Further, by 2018, most of the staff had left the Company as business was minimal, but the Defendants continued to pay themselves handsomely, which showed their desire to drain the Company before winding it up. Wei submits that it was questionable whether such high salaries were in the Company’s best interests, given its poor financial situation then. Wei also argues in closing submissions that the Defendants had unjustifiably increased their salaries in FY2016 without involving Wei in this decision.

The Defendants did not call the meeting, although they admitted that they were obliged to do so. Boey then wrote to the Defendants on 19 January 2017 demanding on Wei’s behalf immediate access to the management accounts and financial statements, but this was not acceded to.

</div> In July 2015, Wei sought sensitive information about the identities of the Company’s customers, and the prices at which the Company bought and sold Parts, purportedly for a “compliance audit” for SH required by Chinese law. The Defendants refused as they did not know why Wei needed the information. In November 2015, Wei sought the Company’s records of purchase orders with its customers claiming that they were needed for an audit of SH. Again, the Defendants refused. Such information would also reveal the Company’s trade secrets, allowing SH to undercut the Company. It was only in December 2015 that Wei informed them that the auditors sought to audit transactions in the companies in which he held shares and that the audit was to enable SH to be listed in China. The Defendants then provided Wei the documents. Wei then tried to gain a majority shareholding over the Company by persuading the Defendants to sell their shares to SH in exchange for cash and shares in SH. In particular, Wei attempted to get Sim to sell his shares to Wei, in order to isolate Low. Thus, Wei no longer had the Company’s best interests at heart as he was advancing SH’s interests at the Company’s expense. To protect the Company’s interests, the Defendants passed the 2015 Resolution declaring the Dividends to themselves and stopped providing Wei the Company’s management accounts in June 2016.

In particular, the Defendants had even refused to give Wei information regarding bonuses and dividends declared, although this information would not have been adverse to the Company’s interests.

On the contrary they had consistently represented to Wei that they would provide him with the Company’s financial information even after June 2016.

</div> I accept Wei’s explanation to be reasonable – that he refused to sign off the FY2013 accounts because he was not a director or shareholder in 2013 and hence it would not be fair for him to approve of matters that he was not appraised of then. Likewise, whilst the Defendants had invited Wei to AGMs to adopt the audited financial statements, these were for FY2011 to FY2013, before Wei was a director (or shareholder) of the Company. Notably, it was only on 4 <span class="font-italic">July</span> 2016 that Wei received the notice of AGM dated 31 <span class="font-italic">May </span>2016 of an AGM to be held on 30 <span class="font-italic">June</span> 2016 to approve the FY2012 audited accounts.

In court, Low confirmed that the seizure of the Company’s books was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a reason the FY2015 accounts had not been audited. The Company’s books seized by CPIB pertained to FY2009 and earlier, and the books seized by IRAS pertained to FY2009 to FY2012. The seizure did not prevent the Company from auditing its accounts for FY2011 to FY2014, between June 2014 and August 2016, and thus it is unclear how it affected its ability to audit its accounts from FY2015. Further, IRAS had returned the Company’s documents by June 2015. As such, there was no good reason why the FY2015 accounts could not be audited thereafter.

</div> I disagree. The evidence shows that Wei had consistently sought information on the Company’s accounts (see [73]–[76] above) and had asked for them to be audited. That there was a clear need to audit the FY2015 accounts can be seen from the huge discrepancies between a set of unaudited accounts for FY2015 disclosed on 16 February 2016 and another set disclosed on 7 August 2017, which Low agreed did not give a true picture of the Company’s financial position in 2015.

The Company was then indirectly a 35% shareholder of SWA and it did not make sense to divert SWA’s LIM technology to LSW, which the Company would only own 20% of.

Wei claims that this was done to prevent him from enjoying the benefits that would flow to the Company. There were also emails which showed that the Company had invested in research and development (“R&amp;D”) of the LIM technology, which suggested that the Defendants had used the Company’s funds to subsidise LSW’s production of the LIM technology. In addition, LSW would now be a competitor of the Company, with the superior LIM technology. There was also no reason why Kenny should be given a 40% share of LSW when he did not contribute to the development of the LIM technology.

To that end, the Company informed Apple on 23 December 2015 that it was putting aside a substantial amount of R&amp;D into development of LIM “in sync” with Apple’s plans. Sim acknowledged that the Company intended to pursue the LIM technology because the Defendants wanted to ensure that it could continue to supply to Apple. That the Company was doing “a lot of R&amp;D” and moving into LIM technology was reiterated to Apple in March 2016.

On 5 September 2017 at the EGM, the Defendants passed a resolution to remove Wei from the board.

</div> I find this unconvincing. There was no evidence that at that time the Company was pinning the blame on the Wei-related Suppliers for any supply delay to Apple. Also, it is unclear how Apple would attribute any delay in the supply of Parts to it, to SH (which issued the “Official Statement” on 30 March 2017 and the 7 April 2017 Notification) as SH did not at that time have any direct contractual relation with Apple. The entities that Apple were familiar or transacted with then were SKL and the Company. Moreover, the 7 April 2017 Notification went beyond informing Apple of the “problems in the supply relationship”. It sought to cast a negative light on the Company and proceeded to inform Apple that SH would take over from SKL the supply of Parts directly to Apple. Hence, I find that SH (and Wei) had contacted Apple as it wanted to supply to Apple directly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 For completeness, I discuss the other reasons the Defendants gave to justify Wei’s removal as a director. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Demand for payment and ceasing of supply</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 There were many demands for payment from the Wei-related Suppliers to the Company.

Wei was safeguarding his interest in the Company and was, as a director, entitled to the documents. He had good reasons to examine the Company documents given the matters that had transpired and how the Defendants had been keeping him in the dark regarding numerous transactions and management decisions that they made in relation to the Company. Pertinently, Wei withdrew his nomination of Boey after the Defendants agreed to provide him with the Company’s financial statements, even though they did not follow through on their agreement (see [76] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I also find that Wei’s conduct in bringing legal proceedings was not a good reason to remove him as a director.

The evidence above shows there was a basis for Wei commencing the Suit for oppression, and for SH and SKL to pursue the Company for the substantial amounts owed by it to them.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng and others </span>[2011] SGHC 30 at [106], the court stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… equitable defences in an action under s 216 are not meant to operate in an all-or-nothing fashion. It is not the case where inordinate delay or the absence of clean hands on the part of a plaintiff would automatically disentitle him to relief. Rather, any inequity on his party would simply be a relevant factor in the court’s overall assessment of whether there has been unfairness warranting relief under s 216(2), and what type of relief is just and equitable in the circumstances. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Further, although the Defendants claim that it was Wei who had caused the Company’s downfall by using his entities to poach its business with Apple, the evidence shows that the Defendants had already caused the Company’s assets to be depleted over time, such as by payments of the Dividends and Big Bonuses to themselves and by the loans to LSW which they never intended for the Company to reclaim. It is also telling that the Defendants took little action to cause the Company’s accounts from FY2015 to be audited. Thus, while Wei’s conduct may have contributed in part to the Company’s downfall, it does not prevent him from succeeding in a claim under s 216 of the CA, although his conduct may affect the relief that the court thinks fit to grant (<span class="font-italic">Re London School of Electronics Ltd</span> [1986] 1 Ch 211 at 221–222).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether claim under s 216 of the CA is made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In the round, I find that the Defendants’ conduct in various matters have been commercially unfair to Wei.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Where an action under s 216 of the CA (“s 216 action”) is commenced in respect of a company which is wound up before the trial of the action, the question is whether such action can continue and whether the court can grant reliefs under s 216.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I am of the view that a s 216 action can continue against a company in liquidation, based on a reading of that section. Section 216 provides that a member of a company may apply to court for an order under that section. A “company” is defined broadly in s 4 of the CA and does not exclude companies which have been put into liquidation. Additionally, s 216(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) allows a claim to be brought in relation to an act of the company that “has been” done or a members’ resolution that “has been” passed which unfairly discriminates or is otherwise prejudicial to a member. This makes clear that a s 216 action can apply to past acts and not merely present acts. Thus, that a company is in liquidation and the directors are <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>do not prevent a minority shareholder from making a claim in respect of acts of the company or members’ resolutions that were previously committed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 It is also consistent with the purpose of s 216 to allow actions to be continued in respect of companies in liquidation, namely, to allow a member to seek redress for acts which are oppressive to him or in disregard of his interests, or which unfairly discriminates against or are prejudicial to him (collectively termed as “oppressive conduct” for convenience) and to bring an end to or remedy the matters complained of (<span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span> at [71]). Certain oppressive conduct may automatically come to an end where liquidators are appointed, as the directors are no longer in control of the company and would not be able to continue their oppressive conduct. However, there may be oppressive conduct which remains unremedied or have a continuing effect even after the company is put in liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>accepted that a s 216 action could continue and even upheld certain reliefs granted by the High Court, even though the company was put in provisional liquidation after the s 216 action was filed (at [72]–[75]). The English courts have likewise allowed proceedings under s 994(1) of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK) (“CA 2006 (UK)”) (pertaining to the affairs of the company being or having been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to a member’s interests) to proceed or continue, although the company was in administration<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Croly v Good and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2010] 2 BCLC 569;<span class="font-italic"> Shepherd v Williamson and another</span> [2010] EWHC 2375 (Ch)) or in liquidation (<span class="font-italic">Re Tobian Properties Ltd</span> [2013] 2 BCLC 567; <span class="font-italic">Re Cabot Global Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2016] EWHC 2287 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Re Cabot Global Ltd</span>”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 It may be argued that allowing a member to continue a s 216 action even after a company is placed in liquidation may open the floodgates of litigation of s 216 actions many years after the oppressive conduct had occurred, when the company had been wound up and the assets had been disposed of. However, this problem may be overstated. As observed earlier, certain forms of oppression come to an end once the company is in liquidation. Further, the court can examine the applicant’s conduct (in bringing a s 216 action late) as a factor in determining whether or what relief is appropriate, even if there is oppressive conduct which has yet to be remedied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Hence, the fact that a company is in liquidation is not in itself a bar to a s 216 action. However, that a company is in liquidation “would have a bearing on further order[s] to be made” (<span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span> at [72]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span> held that while the court’s power to make an order pursuant to s 216 is “very wide”, it must be made “with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of”. In determining what relief is appropriate, one must consider the circumstances at the time of the hearing and not at the time of the application (<span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">re Hailey Group Ltd</span> [1993] BCLC 459 at 473). Whilst certain types of reliefs would not be appropriate if a company is already in provisional liquidation or if liquidators have been appointed (such as a derivative action, as the wrongdoers would no longer be in control) the appointment of liquidators is no bar to other reliefs (<span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span> at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In <span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span>, the High Court had, after finding that there was oppression, ordered the companies in question (KZ and its subsidiary KPM) to be wound up and gave other remedies alongside it. On appeal, in addition to the winding up order, the Court of Appeal upheld certain remedies ordered such as requiring the wrongdoer-shareholder and director of KPM (who was also the managing director of KZ) to purchase or procure the purchase of certain shares which had been acquired by KPM, which he had earlier caused KPM to purchase without consulting the minority shareholder of KZ. That the Company in the present case is in liquidation, as opposed to provisional liquidation, should not make a difference to whether reliefs may be granted, given that in both cases, the effect is the same: the liquidator or provisional liquidator steps into the shoes of the directors and manages the business and controls the assets of the company. If the court can grant reliefs alongside a winding up order (both under s 216(2) of the CA) as in <span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span>, there is no reason why it cannot similarly grant reliefs under s 216(2) of the CA where a winding up order has first been made (albeit under s 254(1) of the CA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In <span class="font-italic">Re Cabot Global Ltd</span>, the applicant brought three s 994 CA 2006 (UK) petitions against certain shareholders of three companies, one of which was in administration, and another went into voluntary liquidation after the petitions were presented. The court found that unfair prejudice was made out and ordered the respondent shareholders to buy out the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Next, I consider <span class="font-italic">Campbell </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd and another </span>(2009) 257 ALR 610, a decision of the High Court of Australia. The applicants brought oppression proceedings pursuant to s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Aust) and applied for reliefs including the winding up of the company under s 233 or s 461 and a buyout of their shares. They also claimed damages pursuant to a statutory cause of action; this is not of concern in the present case. Shortly after, a court-ordered provisional liquidator was, by consent, appointed for the company. The court at first instance found that oppression was made out and held that the appointment of a provisional liquidator did not preclude the applicants from seeking a share buyout and thus granted such relief. By this time, the company was an empty shell and its assets had been disposed of by the provisional liquidator. On appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the buyout order. The applicants sought leave to make a further appeal, which the High Court of Australia refused, stating that it had no prospect of success (at [60] and [183]). In the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ, they stated (at [175], [179] and [182]) that whilst there may have been oppressive conduct, a share buyout should not be made, as by the time of trial, a provisional liquidator had been appointed and he had sold off the business and assets of the company and the shares in the company were worthless. French CJ made similar observations (at [72]). However, the High Court of Australia did not state that the fact that a company is in liquidation would preclude relief being granted; it merely found that a share buyout was inappropriate given the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Hence, that a company is already wound up at the time of the trial of a s 216 action is no bar to the action continuing or to the court granting reliefs under s 216(2) where appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I note at the outset that the Suit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the s 216 action) was commenced in 2017 and the Company was ordered to be wound up in June 2020 (pursuant to an application by the Defendants under s 254(1) of the CA), a few months before the start of the trial of the Suit. There was thus no substantial delay in bringing the s 216 action such that I should refuse to grant relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Nevertheless, I am not minded to order the Defendants buy over Wei’s shares in the Company. The Company is likely insolvent given the amounts owing to its creditors (including the Wei-related Suppliers). The Company’s accounts have not been audited from FY2015, and it is unlikely to be audited given that the Company has been wound up. Hence, there may be difficulties in a proper determination of what is fair value at the date of this decision or at April 2016 (as Wei has sought),

</div> and any attempt at such determination is likely to be time-consuming and expensive. In any event, the liquidators may carry out investigations and take appropriate steps to redress any wrongs to the Company committed by its directors (see <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings Ltd v Gryphon Real Estate Investment Corp Pte Ltd and others (Foo Peow Yong Douglas, third party) and another suit</span> [2017] SGHC 73 at [293]). Moreover, whilst Wei claims that the downfall of the Company was caused by the Defendants’ actions (such as paying themselves from the assets of the Company and causing advances to be made to LSW which have not been pursued by the Company), Wei had also contributed to the Company’s demise when he caused SH to undercut the Company and supply directly to Apple. It bears remembering that Wei was at the material time also a director and shareholder of the Company. As fairness and equity play important roles in a s 216 action, the conduct of all parties should be taken into account when considering the appropriate reliefs under s 216(2) of the CA. It would not be fair to give Wei a windfall by ordering the Defendants to buy over shares that may now be worth little when Wei had contributed in part to the devaluation of these shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Whilst that may be the case, the Defendants’ oppressive conduct which occurred prior to SH undercutting the Company cannot be ignored. Thus, I order Low and Sim to pay the Company the sums paid to them pursuant to the invalidly declared Dividends, namely US$800,000 each, as well as the Big Bonuses I have found were made in breach of the Company’s Articles. The payment of the Dividends and the Big Bonuses unfairly discriminated against and prejudiced Wei by reducing the overall assets of the Company of which Wei is a shareholder. In <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> (at [118]) the court noted that its wide discretion to fashion such relief it considers just can extend to making orders for the errant shareholder or director to make restitution to the company of monies that they have wrongfully diverted from the company. The Court however (at [119]) cautioned against too readily granting what is in essence a corporate relief in an oppression remedy and stated the necessity of focusing on the essential remedy the applicant is seeking. It also noted that a s 216 action should generally not be permitted where the essential remedy sought is for the company and in such a case the appropriate remedy would be a statutory derivative action under s 216A of the CA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The above concerns do not bar the remedies ordered in the present case. Here, a s 216A derivative action would not avail the Company which has been wound up (see <span class="font-italic">Kumagai </span>at [72]; <span class="font-italic">Petroships Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd and others and another</span><span class="font-italic"> matter</span> [2016] 2 SLR 1022). The mere winding up of the Company without an order to make restitution to it of the amounts improperly paid out to the Defendants from its assets, would not remedy the commercial unfairness to Wei and bring an end to the oppressive conduct complained of. This is even if the order, which would increase the overall assets for distribution, may not result in sufficient net assets available thereafter for distribution to the shareholders (including Wei). Low and Sim, in paying themselves US$800,000 each (from the Dividends) and the Big Bonuses (of around $793,597 and $695,897 respectively), had committed personal wrongs against Wei as he was deprived of similar payments (if they had been paid out validly in conformity with the Articles of the Company). It bears noting also that whilst the claim pertaining to the Big Bonuses relates to Wei (and the Defendants) being directors of the Company, the right pertaining to management participation is closely related to Wei’s right as a shareholder of the Company. The courts have protected the interests of a member <span class="font-italic">qua</span> director (see <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy s/o Marudapan v Nagatheran s/o Manogar and another</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 542).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In light of the above order that I have made, there is no need to deal with Wei’s alternative prayer that he be paid US$1.5 million by the Defendants. In any event, such relief is inappropriate as I have found the Dividends were invalidly declared and thus none of the shareholders (including Wei) were entitled to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As for Wei’s submission for a declaration that the Defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, Wei did not plead this relief (despite having amended his Statement of Claim five times) and this was only raised in his closing submissions. I also do not see how such a declaration would bring an end to or remedy the oppressive conduct complained off. Further I have already made findings pertaining to Low’s duties owed to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In conclusion, I find that Wei’s claim under s 216(1) of the CA is made out, and I order that Low and Sim pay or return to the Company US$800,000 each and the equivalent of the Big Bonuses. I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jimmy Yim SC, Kevin Lee, Eunice Lau and Lim Joe Jee (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="txt-body text-right">Tan Chuan Thye SC, Jared Kok and <br/>Shaun Ou (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the first and second defendants.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
