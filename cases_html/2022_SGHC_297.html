</div> But the point is not whether the assets recovered from a bankrupt’s estate would be sufficient to repay <span class="font-italic">all </span>the bankrupt’s debts. Invariably in many situations of insolvency, creditors would generally obtain only a proportion of what they are owed. Here, the outstanding mortgage loan with SCB and the amounts that would have to be returned to the Bankrupt and Respondent’s CPF accounts if a sale is ordered, aggregates $1,558,587.49 (based on the latest information available in July/August 2022) (see [6] above). Assuming the current market value of the Property is $1,850,000 (based on a valuation report of 22 March 2022 enclosed in the Defendant’s Letter (see [7] above), there remains about $290,000 for distribution to the creditors. In this regard, the parties agreed that the Defendant’s 1% share in the Property would be accounted for by the refund into her CPF account from the Net Proceeds, should the court make an order for such refund.

As I noted at [15] above, it is quite common in insolvency proceedings that creditors are unable to recover a substantial percentage of their debts. However, this should not be a reason in itself to tilt the balance in favour of the Bankrupt (or the Defendant) by refusing to order a realisation of an asset to satisfy the debts.

The Bankrupt was to make a Monthly Contribution of $1,920 from June 2020.

</div> This showed that the Bankrupt had not made any serious attempts to discharge his debts. Indeed, at the adjourned hearing before me on 21 November 2022 (after the first hearing on 3 August 2022) Mr Chung then claimed that the Bankrupt had commenced making repayment of the Monthly Contribution from June 2022 until October 2022. There was no evidence to support his assertion made at the last minute, and even if true, it is pertinent to note that the Bankrupt’s attempts to restart payment of the Monthly Contribution occurred only after this application was filed in May 2022. Even if I had accepted Mr Chung’s claim, the Defendant would still only have contributed some 7.5 months of Monthly Contribution out of 29 months (from June 2020 to October 2022) and there was no evidence that he would continue to make the Monthly Contribution from November 2022 onwards. As for the Defendant’s proposed undertaking, this did not assist her, given her assertion that she “is working a low-salary job to support the entire family” and that she “doesn’t have much savings left”.

</div> Contrary to what the Defendant had attempted to portray, there is no automatic termination of her daughter’s place in the School if the 30-month minimum stay requirement is not met. The MOE website merely states that “MOE reserves the right to transfer the child to another school with vacancies”. As parties accepted, the intent of MOE’s policy is to prevent parents, who register a child for the primary school of their choice based on distance, from abusing the admission process by taking up temporary accommodation near the school of choice to gain priority for admission only to then relocate shortly after the child has been accepted into that school. Mr Chung had not produced evidence to show that a family who has to subsequently relocate due to extraneous circumstances, such as the court making an order for the sale of the Property, would likely face similar consequences (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that MOE would transfer the child out of the school) as a family who has attempted to abuse the system. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Third, a substantial amount of time (of more than two years) has passed since the making of the Bankruptcy Order on 20 February 2020 and the taking out of this application on 20 May 2022. This is an important factor in the Claimant’s favour in the balancing exercise: <span class="font-italic">Ngoh Bibiana </span>at [35]. Even before this application was filed, the Claimant had also sought the Defendant’s consent on the sale of the Property by way of the Claimant’s Letter sent on 3 March 2022. Hence, by the time of the hearing before me on 21 November 2022, the Defendant has had sufficient notice of the Claimant’s intention to sell the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Ngoh Bibiana</span> (at [34]–[36]) the Court of Appeal accepted that where the application for a property to be sold is made less than a year from the making of the bankruptcy order, this might be grounds for the sale to be delayed to give the bankrupt more time to look for alternative means of paying his debts and to find other arrangements for housing. In the present case, the Bankrupt and Defendant had more than two years since the making of the Bankruptcy Order to make alternative accommodation arrangements. It thus could not be said that the Defendant and her family would be prejudiced in having insufficient time and opportunity to source for alternative accommodation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Finally, whilst the Defendant has contributed some $24,000 from her CPF account towards the purchase of the Property (see [6(b)] above), this was not a significant sum as to tilt the balance in her favour.

</div> this was not borne out by the evidence. The Defendant had disclosed a bank statement from Kelvin’s bank account only for April 2020, but she did not disclose any documents to show that Kelvin had been discharging the mortgage on the Property from May 2020 onwards. Even if I had accepted that Kelvin was making the monthly mortgage repayments since April 2020, this was irrelevant and did not assist the Defendant’s case. At best, Kelvin would be a creditor of the Bankrupt and Defendant because (as the Defendant asserted) Kelvin expects to be repaid. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application under s 352(6) of IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I turn then to the Claimant’s prayer under s 352(6) of IRDA (see [1(b)] above). I had indicated at the first hearing of this application that this prayer was premature as no sale proceeds have been recovered given that the Claimant had not obtained the sale of the Property. At the second hearing before me, the Claimant then decided to withdraw this prayer and I made no order on it. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate to mention this point briefly as it is important to note at what stage an application under s 352(6) IRDA should be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Section 352(6) of IRDA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where any creditor has given any indemnity or made any payment of moneys by virtue of which any asset of the bankrupt <span class="font-italic">has been recovered, protected or preserved</span>, the Court may make such order as it thinks just with respect to the distribution of such asset with a view to giving that creditor an advantage over other creditors in consideration of the risks run by the creditor in so doing.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is clear from s 352(6) of IRDA that the Court cannot make an order with respect to the distribution of an asset of the bankrupt <span class="font-italic">before </span>the asset has been recovered, protected or preserved.

It suffices to say also that different considerations would apply in determining whether an order should be granted under s 352(6) of IRDA giving priority of distribution of an asset to one creditor over another. Such considerations were not fully articulated for the court’s consideration by the Claimant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the above reasons, I allowed the Property to be sold.

Hence, although I empathised with the Defendant on the difficulties the sale of the Property would bring, the present situation was one where the interests of the creditors outweighed that of the Defendant and her family for the reasons set out above. To mitigate the situation, I further ordered that the Defendant and her family be allowed to reside in the Property until 25 August 2023 (some nine more months), to allow them sufficient time to find alternative accommodation. This was also bearing in mind that the Couple’s daughter has just started primary school this year. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I further ordered that the proceeds from the sale of the Property were to be paid to the Bankrupt’s estate: (a) after deducting the expenses connected with the sale of the Property and the repayment of the outstanding mortgage; and (b) after refunding the Bankrupt’s and Defendant’s respective CPF contributions to the Property (inclusive of interest). There would be no further apportionment of 1% of the sale proceeds towards the Defendant’s share in the Property, given that the refund of the Defendant’s CPF contribution (even without taking into account the interest on the CPF contribution) would more than compensate the Defendant for her 1% interest in the Property. Both parties were agreeable to this.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Audrey Lim<br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tong Chuan (Excelsior Law Chambers LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chung Ting Fai and Yuge Li (Chung Ting Fai &amp; Co) </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
