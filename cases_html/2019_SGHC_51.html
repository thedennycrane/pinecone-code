The complaint was subsequently laid before a Complaints Committee (“CC”). On 30 April 2015, the SMC sent a further letter to the chairman of the CP with additional information about the plaintiff. This additional information was subsequently laid before the CC as well. For the purposes of this judgment, I will refer to the complaint made by the SMC on 14 February 2014 and the additional information provided by the SMC on 30 April 2015 collectively as “the Complaint”. Over the course of conducting its inquiry into the Complaint, the CC applied in writing to the chairman of the CP for 13 extensions of time (“EOTs”) to complete its inquiry, and the chairman granted these EOTs to the CC. The CC completed its inquiry on 12 February 2018 and determined that a formal inquiry was necessary. The CC thus ordered that an inquiry into the Complaint be held by a Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 2 May 2018, the plaintiff filed Originating Summons No 514 of 2018 (“OS 514/2018”) against the defendants. The defendants are the chairman of the CP (the first defendant), the members of the CC (the second to fourth defendants), and the SMC (the fifth defendant).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Medical Registration Act in force as at 14 February 2014 was an amended version of the 2004 Revised Edition. The disciplinary proceedings under the Medical Registration Act involving the plaintiff nevertheless run to the present day, and the Medical Registration Act currently in force as at the date of this judgment is an amended version of the 2014 Revised Edition. In spite of this, the relevant provisions of the Medical Registration Act cited for the purposes of this judgment remain the same notwithstanding the different versions of this piece of legislation. In this judgment, references to statutory provisions will thus be to provisions of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (“MRA”) in force as at the date of this judgment unless otherwise stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 OS 514/2018 is the plaintiff’s application for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, leave to apply for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a quashing order to quash all applications by the CC to the chairman of the CP pursuant to s 42(2) for EOTs for the CC to complete its inquiry into the Complaint;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a quashing order to quash all grants of such EOTs by the chairman of the CP to the CC pursuant to s 42(2);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a quashing order to quash the CC’s order that an inquiry into the Complaint be held by a DT; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) a prohibiting order to prohibit the SMC from referring the Complaint to the chairman of the CP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Summons No 2032 of 2018 (“SUM 2032/2018”) is the plaintiff’s application for discovery of documents, which the defendants opposed.

The clinic was licensed to him under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (Cap 248, 1999 Rev Ed) (“PHMCA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 3 April 2013, MOH sent a letter to the plaintiff which, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, noted that the clinic offered some non-mainstream services in addition to mainstream medical services, and alleged that there were contraventions of certain subsidiary legislation under the PHMCA.

I thus address this issue first.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In determining whether a provision is directory or mandatory, the court is required to determine Parliament’s intention to ascertain whether non-compliance would invalidate the thing done under the provision (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2012] 1 SLR 701 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Mey Lee Susan</span>”) at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Chai Choon Yong v Central Provident Fund Board and others</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 594 at [43]–[45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As mentioned, the plaintiff argued that s 42(2) is a mandatory provision in two main aspects: (i) the time when a CC is to apply for an EOT, and (ii) the reasons why the EOT is applied for and subsequently granted. This would mean that a non-compliance with s 42(2) invalidates a CC’s application for an EOT or the grant of an EOT by the chairman of the CP to a CC. On the other hand, the defendants argued that s 42(2) is a directory provision. This would mean that even if there was non-compliance with s 42(2), that would not invalidate a CC’s application for an EOT or the grant of an EOT by the chairman of the CP to a CC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I briefly mention the plaintiff’s general arguments as to why s 42(2) is a mandatory provision. The plaintiff argued that in introducing the predecessor provisions of ss 42(1) and 42(2), the Minister for Health Mr Yeo Cheow Tong expressly stated that “[t]o ensure that complaints are dealt with expeditiously, each [CC] will be given three months to complete its preliminary investigations” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (25 August 1997) vol 67 at col 1566). The plaintiff thus submitted that Parliament was clear in its intention for s 42(1) to be complied with strictly in that a CC is to complete its inquiry not later than three months, and any EOT granted by the chairman of the CP pursuant to s 42(2) must be limited.

</div> For instance, s 40(4) states: “No act done by or under the authority of a Complaints Committee shall be invalid in consequence of any defect that is subsequently discovered in the appointment or qualification of the members or any of them.”</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Time when a CC is to apply for an EOT</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I address first the issue pertaining to the time when a CC is to apply for an EOT. The plaintiff argued that under s 42(2), a CC must apply to the chairman of the CP for an EOT before its deadline to complete its inquiry, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before its initial deadline of three months (s 42(1)) or before any extended deadline. In this case, the CC in fact applied for EOTs after some of the extended deadlines to complete its inquiry (see [34] above). Consequently, the plaintiff argued that such non-compliance with s 42(2) necessarily invalidated the CC’s applications for EOTs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The terms of s 42(2) do not expressly stipulate when a CC is to apply for an EOT. The terms of s 42(2) may seem to suggest that a CC is to apply for an EOT before its initial or extended deadline to complete its inquiry as the terms refer to a CC being of the opinion that it will not be able to complete its inquiry within the specified period. However, in considering the predecessor provision of s 42(2) which is materially similar to s 42(2), the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chai Chwan v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2009] SGHC 115 (“<span class="font-italic">Chai Chwan</span>”) was of the view that the wording of the predecessor provision allowed the CC to apply for an EOT “at any time before or even after the three-month expiry date” (see [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any case, even if s 42(2) requires a CC to apply for an EOT before its initial or extended deadline to complete its inquiry, I am of the view that Parliament did not intend for any such omission to invalidate the CC’s application for an EOT. In the absence of clear words to suggest invalidation for non-compliance, it could not have been Parliament’s intention that even an accidental oversight to apply for an EOT before a deadline would result in the disproportionate consequence that the CC can no longer continue its inquiry. Likewise, Parliament could not have intended that an application made a few days late would have such a disproportionate consequence. What purpose would it serve to interpret s 42(2) to mean that an application for an EOT after a CC’s deadline is invalid? If an application for an EOT were invalidated for such a reason, this would merely mean that the same complaint would be laid before a new CC, with the risk that this cycle might be repeated if the new CC also does not apply for an EOT before its deadline. This would unnecessarily complicate and lengthen the process of inquiry into that complaint. Furthermore, if, for the sake of argument, the complaint cannot be laid afresh before a new CC because of double jeopardy or a similar argument, that would mean that the registered medical practitioner who was the subject of inquiry would escape liability on a technicality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It is important to note that the MRA does not stipulate a long-stop date by which a CC has to complete its inquiry. Parliament was cognisant of this fact given that in the parliamentary debates on 11 January 2010 for the Second Reading of the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill (Bill 22 of 2009), the Minister for Health Mr Khaw Boon Wan acknowledged suggestions for such a long-stop date (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (11 January 2010) vol 86 at cols 1954–1955). However, the Minister stated that the SMC would “make every effort to conclude the investigations of every complaint within a reasonable time”. Parliament did not thereafter legislate a long-stop date by which a CC has to complete its inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This is unlike the regime under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) for disciplinary proceedings in relation to regulated legal practitioners. Under s 86(3) of the LPA, there is a long-stop date for an Inquiry Committee (the body serving a similar function as a CC) to report its findings, where any EOT granted to the Inquiry Committee “shall not extend beyond the period of 6 months from the date of the appointment of that Inquiry Committee”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Therefore, although I accept that the intent behind s 42(1) and s 42(2) was for inquiries to be completed expeditiously, this does not mean that the CC’s failure to seek an EOT before its deadline leads to the disproportionate consequence advocated by the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the CC can no longer continue its inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reasons why an EOT is applied for and subsequently granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I address next the issue pertaining to the reasons why an EOT is applied for by a CC and subsequently granted by the chairman of the CP to the CC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiff argued that under s 42(2), a CC can only apply for an EOT if, first, the CC is of the <span class="font-italic">opinion</span> that it will not be able to complete its inquiry before its deadline due to<span class="font-italic"> </span>the complexity of the matter or serious difficulties encountered in conducting its inquiry.

In this case, the plaintiff argued that the chairman granted EOTs to the CC as a matter of course without considering whether the EOTs were justified by the complexity of the matter or the serious difficulties the CC encountered in conducting its inquiry.

</div> Consequently, the plaintiff argued that such non-compliance with s 42(2) also necessarily invalidated the chairman’s grants of EOTs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 On this point, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chai Chwan</span> was of the view that the predecessor provision of s 42(2), which is materially similar to s 42(2), conferred upon the chairman of the CP a discretion that was “not based on any conditions that must be satisfied” before he could exercise his discretion to grant an EOT (at [40]). The High Court stated that the language of “as he thinks fit” in the provision was “in plain and unfettered terms” (at [40]). The High Court took the view that nowhere in the legislation did it mention the matters which the chairman should have regard to when exercising his discretion to grant an EOT (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I have my doubts as to whether s 42(2) should be interpreted to mean that the discretion of the chairman of the CP in granting an EOT is not based on any conditions that must be satisfied. It is arguable that the phrase “as he thinks fit” in s 42(2) refers only to the discretion of the chairman with regard to the length of the EOT he decides to grant, and that the chairman still has to satisfy himself that the CC will not be able to complete its inquiry before its deadline “due to the complexity of the matter or serious difficulties encountered by the [CC] in conducting its inquiry”. Otherwise, it is illogical that a CC should seek an EOT on such reasons (only) but the chairman of the CP does not have to satisfy himself that such reasons exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For present purposes, I assume that there is non-compliance with s 42(2) when a CC and the chairman of the CP respectively do not act in the manner that the plaintiff argued they have to act under s 42(2) (see [61]–[62] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I consider the implications if a CC’s non-compliance with s 42(2), because of the inadequacy of its reasons for applying for an EOT, necessarily invalidates the CC’s application for an EOT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, a registered medical practitioner who is the subject of the CC’s inquiry could easily make a challenge against the reasons for which the CC applied for an EOT, regardless of whether there was any merit to his challenge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Second, even if there was some merit in such a challenge, much time and effort would have to be expended by all concerned to meet the challenge. The present case is a case in point. The plaintiff sought discovery of documents and answers to interrogatories to scrutinise the reasons for the CC’s applications for EOTs. There might also be lengthy arguments as to whether the reasons met the statutory requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Third, even if it could be easily established that a CC’s reasons for applying for an EOT could not withstand scrutiny, this brings us back to the question mentioned at [56] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, what purpose would it serve to interpret s 42(2) to mean that the application for the EOT is invalid? If the same complaint may be laid before a new CC, this would give rise to the scenario mentioned, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the process of inquiry into that complaint would be complicated and lengthened with the risk that the cycle might be repeated. Moreover, if the complaint cannot be laid afresh before a new CC, that would mean that the registered medical practitioner who was the subject of inquiry would escape liability on what could still be considered a technicality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On the other hand, the plaintiff argued that to allow a CC to obtain multiple EOTs easily would defeat the purpose of s 42(1) which was to ensure the expeditious conclusion of its inquiry into a complaint. It would also not be in the interest of the registered medical practitioner in question or the public for undue delays in the conclusion of an inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The plaintiff also raised the point that a CC may not have good reasons for applying for an EOT and its inquiry process would thereby become unnecessarily prolonged should the EOT be granted to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 There was some force in these arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 However, the words of May LJ in <span class="font-italic">Regina v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police, </span><span class="font-italic">Ex parte Calveley and Others</span> [1986] 1 QB 424 (“<span class="font-italic">Calveley</span>”) at 439 come to my mind:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Unnecessary delay in legal and analogous proceedings, such as the disciplinary ones in the instant case, is of course to be deplored, but it does occur and, in the absence of mala fides, should not tempt one to resort to judicial review where no real abuse or breach of natural justice can be shown.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This was also cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Tiang Hin Jerry v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 553 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Tiang Hin Jerry</span>”) at [50].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 At present, each CC may be required to inquire into discrete complaints against more than one registered medical practitioner. For example, in this case, the CC was apparently inquiring into seven discrete complaints against various registered medical practitioners at one time.

</div> means that unfortunately, it will not be surprising that a CC will have to seek at least an EOT to complete its inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is also likely that a CC will need to seek EOTs for reasons other than the complexity of the matter or serious difficulties it encountered in conducting its inquiry. The mere reason that more time is required to inquire into each of the discrete complaints before the CC is not likely to constitute such a serious difficulty as is envisaged in s 42(2). By way of another example, the reason that the schedules of the members of the CC are such that they have difficulty in getting suitable dates to meet together on enough occasions to complete their inquiry is also not likely to constitute such a serious difficulty as is envisaged in s 42(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 This is not a satisfactory situation. I agree that a CC’s inquiry should be concluded as expeditiously as possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 However, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s contentions, to invalidate a CC’s application for an EOT because of the inadequacy of its reasons for its application, will result in an even more unsatisfactory situation. The process of inquiry by the CC will become unworkable in reality. Challenge upon challenge will be mounted and the same complaint may have to be laid before a new CC again and again. Alternatively, the whole process comes to nought if the chairman of the CP is not even entitled to lay the complaint before a new CC in such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I mention again that the MRA does not stipulate a long-stop date by which a CC has to complete its inquiry (see the discussion at [57]–[59] above). Therefore, although I accept that the intent behind s 42(1) and s 42(2) was for inquiries to be completed expeditiously, this does not mean that the intent was also that the inadequacy of a CC’s reasons for applying for an EOT leads to the disproportionate consequence advocated by the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the CC can no longer continue its inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 On balance, I therefore am of the view that in the absence of clear words to the contrary, Parliament did not intend for the inadequacy of a CC’s reasons for applying for an EOT to invalidate the CC’s application for an EOT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the same reasons, I am of the view that Parliament did not intend to invalidate the grant of an EOT by the chairman of the CP to the CC simply because the chairman did not grant such EOT on the basis of the complexity of the matter or serious difficulties encountered by the CC in conducting its inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I have mentioned that a CC may be required to inquire into discrete complaints against various registered medical practitioners at a given time. It is likely that multiple applications for EOTs, whether for the same complaint or for discrete complaints, are likely to be made by the CC to the chairman of the CP. Conversely, the chairman will be receiving multiple applications for EOTs and this is all the more so as there may be more than one CC appointed at a given time. If the chairman of the CP has to satisfy himself that each CC has adequate reason for each application for an EOT to hold the opinion that the EOT is required because of complexity or serious difficulties, then he too will be inundated and the scheme will be unworkable. The requirements in s 42(2) are meant to encourage the expeditious conclusion of an inquiry by the CC but not to frustrate the entire process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Directory provisions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In summary:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If a CC applies for an EOT after its initial or extended deadline to complete its inquiry, the CC’s application for an EOT is not invalidated.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If a CC’s application for an EOT is made without adequate reasons, because:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the CC is not of the opinion that the matter is complex or that it encountered serious difficulties in conducting its inquiry; and/or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) there is in fact no such complexity or serious difficulties,</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">the CC’s application for an EOT is not invalidated.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the chairman of the CP grants an EOT to a CC without in fact holding the opinion that the CC will be unable to complete its inquiry before its deadline due to the complexity of the matter or serious difficulties it encountered in conducting its inquiry, the chairman’s grant of the EOT is not invalidated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It follows then that applications made by the CC for EOTs or the grants of such EOTs by the chairman of the CP under s 42(2) cannot be challenged on the grounds of illegality and irrationality. <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, they also cannot be challenged under the precedent fact principle of review.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In this regard, I observe that the parties in <span class="font-italic">Chai Chwan</span> did not seem to have argued whether the predecessor provision of s 42(2), which is materially similar to s 42(2), was a directory provision or a mandatory provision. The High Court consequently did not make any comment on this. Instead, the High Court considered whether the chairman of the CP had granted EOTs to the CC irrationally. This might have arisen because of the submissions before the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Further, I note that in the present case there was no allegation that there was a breach of the rule of fair hearing or of the rule against bias, on the part of the CC or the chairman of the CP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 This does not mean that a registered medical practitioner who is the subject of the CC’s inquiry is completely at the mercy of the process. If indeed he has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of any alleged non-compliance, he may seek an order to end the process. If a plaintiff suffered substantial prejudice as a result of some non-compliance with a directory provision, the thing done under that provision may be invalidated (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Tiang Hin Jerry</span> at [39], [48]–[51]).

It was subsequently MOH’s decision not to renew the plaintiff’s clinic licence when it expired on 16 March 2015. MOH had made its decision in accordance with the PHMCA, and based on the inspection findings from February 2013 to March 2015 that the clinic had repeatedly not complied with the licensing requirements under the PHMCA and its subsidiary legislation in prescribing certain treatments (see [19] above). The plaintiff then appealed against this decision to the Minister for Health. MOH thereafter sent a letter to the plaintiff on 24 April 2017 informing him that the Minister had decided to allow the plaintiff’s appeal and had directed that his clinic licence be renewed for six months subject to the condition that he strictly comply with MOH’s guidelines on the provision of non-evidence-based medicine (see [29] above).

The plaintiff had used the duration of 3.5 years but this period was calculated from 16 March 2015 (when MOH decided not to renew his clinic licence) to the date of his written submissions of 19 September 2018 to the court. However, as mentioned, MOH had sent a letter to the plaintiff on 24 April 2017, around two years later from 16 March 2015, informing him that his clinic licence would be renewed. It is a separate matter if the plaintiff decided not to restart the clinic (see [30] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiff’s alleged loss of livelihood for a period of time is also different in nature from a possible finding that he was guilty of some disciplinary offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For completeness, I would mention that the plaintiff’s clinic licence was initially not renewed by MOH apparently because the plaintiff was prescribing certain treatments.

It is premature to conclude that even if the plaintiff truly cannot contact the patients he seeks to serve as witnesses, he would be prejudiced in presenting his case before a DT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The inquiry to be held by a DT into the Complaint pertains to the issue of the plaintiff offering some <span class="font-italic">non-mainstream</span> services and concerns over the appropriateness of the medical management of some patients. The plaintiff himself believes that the Complaint would come under para 4.1.4 of the SMC Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines,

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Based on the present evidence, I do not accept that any alleged non-compliance with s 42(2) by the CC and/or the chairman of the CP resulted in the plaintiff suffering substantial prejudice such that it merits the invalidation of the CC’s order that an inquiry into the Complaint be held by a DT.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was inordinate delay in the prosecution of disciplinary proceedings amounting to an abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Given my finding that the plaintiff had not suffered any of the substantial prejudice he alleged, I do not have to address his argument as to whether at common law, there was inordinate delay in the prosecution of disciplinary proceedings against him such as would amount to an abuse of process or breach of natural justice (see [43] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the leave application was premature</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I briefly address the issue of whether the leave application in OS 514/2018 was premature. I accept that the leave application was not premature <span class="font-italic">only</span> to the extent that the plaintiff’s arguments were premised on substantial prejudice that he had suffered as a result of any alleged non-compliance with s 42(2). If the plaintiff had been successful in persuading the court that he had suffered substantial prejudice as a result, his remedy might have included, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the quashing of the CC’s order that an inquiry be held by a DT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 However, in so far as the rest of the plaintiff’s arguments did not concern substantial prejudice suffered as a result of any alleged non-compliance with s 42(2), I find that the leave application was premature. The words of May LJ in <span class="font-italic">Calveley</span> at 439 (just before those quoted at [73] above) are also relevant in this regard:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… prima facie the present applicants should be left to their statutory appeals in the course of which the tribunal can consider not only the point based on the failure to give notice under regulation 7 in time and also the question of delay, but in addition the general merits of the case. Although judicial review can provide an effective, convenient and relatively swift remedy, it should only be granted, particularly where the basis of the application is merely delay in taking the necessary proceedings, where this can properly be described as amounting to an abuse of process. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Likewise, the plaintiff still has the opportunity to argue his case before a DT and before the High Court for any appeal thereafter. Before a DT and the High Court, the plaintiff may raise issues concerning the alleged delay by the CC in completing its inquiry for them to be taken into account in determining the plaintiff’s liability and sanction, should liability be established (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Mey Lee Susan</span> at [40]; <span class="font-italic">Jen Shek Wei v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2018] 3 SLR 943 at [167]–[169]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 68</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I also make some brief comments on s 68. Section 68 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">No action in absence of bad faith</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68. No action or proceedings shall lie against the Medical Council, a Complaints Committee, a Disciplinary Tribunal, the Health Committee or any other committee appointed by the Medical Council or any member or employee thereof for any act or thing done under this Act unless it is proved to the court that the act or thing was done in bad faith or with malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 As mentioned, the defendants argued in their written submissions that pursuant to s 68, the plaintiff must, in his leave application in OS 514/2018, also prove to the court that the acts of the CC, of the chairman of the CP and of the SMC were done in bad faith or with malice (see [48] above). This point was not expanded on or pursued during oral arguments and the plaintiff did not respond to this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I doubt that s 68 precludes or limits the commencement of judicial review proceedings. However, without full arguments from the parties and in the light of my decision, I do not have to say more on this provision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Further remarks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the light of the reasons above, I also do not have to address the remaining arguments of the parties. Many of them would be academic for the purposes of these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I deal with one further point. I agree with the defendants that the plaintiff should have filed an affidavit in support of OS 514/2018 verifying all the facts he relied on, as required under O 53 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).
