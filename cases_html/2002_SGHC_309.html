        This action touches on two main issues, the

formation of a building sub-contract and libel.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The plaintiff L.K. Ang Construction Pte Ltd was

the main contractor for addition and alteration works to be carried out on a factory. The

employer was Techplas Industries Pte Ltd. The contract between the plaintiff and the

employer incorporated the SIA Conditions of Contract 6<sup>th</sup> Edn.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        The defendant Chubb Singapore Pte Ltd tendered

successfully for the Fire Protection Installation Works ("the FPI works"). On 5

Dec 2001, it was informed by the M&amp;E consultant that it would be appointed the

nominated sub-contractor for the FPI works.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        On 6 Dec 2001 the architect instructed the

plaintiff to issue a letter of award to the defendant and to enter into a nominated

sub-contract with it. The plaintiff, in compliance with the architect’s letter, wrote

to the defendant on 18 Jan 2002 that</font></p>

    above-mentioned project.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Performance Bond in the form

    of Banker’s Guarantee as stated in the Main Contract should cover for the period from

    5 December 2001 to 28 September 2003.</font></p>

    to our project schedule. Please note that the terms and conditions of your Sub-Contract

    shall be same as the Main Contract as far as your scope of works and shall be strictly

    followed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Although it was not stated that a

sub-contract was formed between them by the issuance of the letter, the plaintiff’s

case is that such an agreement was formed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        The defendant commenced work as instructed (it

had started some preparatory works even before 18 Jan), and submitted its progress claims

for work done on 21 Jan and 28 Feb.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        It also caused a financial credit search to be

made on the plaintiff in compliance with its financial risk policy. A credit reference

agency DP Information Networks Pte Ltd was engaged for the purpose. The defendant was

disturbed by the agency’s report which concluded with</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Unfavourable &amp; favourable

    factors carry similar weight in credit consideration. Capability to overcome financial

    difficulties seems comparatively limited or considered not known. Capability to pay both

    interest and principal sums is doubtful.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        It sought to alter the payment arrangements so

that it could receive payment for the sub-contract works direct from the employer, rather

than through the plaintiff as the main contractor. The request was made to the architect

by letters dated 18 Feb and 20 Feb, the second of which enclosed a copy of the credit

report. In the letters the defendant gave notice that it would not sign a sub-contract

with the plaintiff if direct payment from the employer was not allowed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        On 26 Feb it sent the architect a third letter

which is the subject of this action. The letter reads -</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

        Copies of the letter were sent to the employer,

the M&amp;E consultant, the quantity surveyor and the plaintiff.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        The request was turned down and the defendant

stopped work on 28 Feb. The plaintiff regarded the stoppage of work as a repudiation of

the sub-contract. It accepted the repudiation and treated the sub-contract as terminated.

It appointed another sub-contractor, Sprinkler Engineering Pte Ltd to undertake the work

for $223,388 and sued for damages for breach of the sub-contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

portions of the letter of 26 Feb were defamatory in that in its natural and ordinary

meaning it meant that </font></p>

        I find the plaintiff’s reading of the

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">per Lord Atkinson, <i>Adam v Ward</i>

[1917] AC 309 @ 334</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        There was no dispute that the defendant had an

interest in the financial standing of the plaintiff, as its receipt of payments under the

sub-contract would be affected if the plaintiff ran into financial difficulties in the

course of the project.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        The architect had an interest in the progress

of the project. He was the proper party for the request to be addressed, and he needed to

know of the reason for the request to advise the employer on it. The M&amp;E consultant

also had an interest. The FPI works came within the purview of the mechanical and

electrical works. It negotiated with and recommended the appointment of the defendant for

these works, issued the letter of 5 Dec, and would monitor the works when they were

carried out. It was reasonable for the defendant to inform the M&amp;E consultant of the

request and the reason for it, as its views may be sought by the employer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        However the plaintiff denied that the quantity

surveyor had any interest in the FPI works to justify sending the letter to him. Counsel

for the defendant submitted at length that the quantity surveyor was a proper recipient of

the letter, but length was not matched by content. There was nothing to show that that

quantity surveyor had any role in the appointment of the defendant or any interest to be

informed of the defendant’s apprehensions over the plaintiff’s financial

position and the request to change the payment procedure.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        The plaintiff contended that the qualified

privilege defence was not available because the defendant acted with actual malice. The

plaintiff argued that there was malice because (i) the words were published recklessly,

(ii) the defendant was late to apologise or withdraw the words, and (iii) the

defendant’s true intention was to withdraw from the sub-contract because its price

was too low.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        The defendant was acting properly in obtaining

a credit report on the plaintiff from D P Information Networks. When it received the

report, it regarded it as a negative report. However it forwarded a copy of the report to

the architect with its request.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        In the letter of 26 Feb it stated that the

plaintiff had a poor credit rating. Those words were not used in the report, but was the

defendant’s reading of it. The credit report had placed the plaintiff in the fifth of

seven categories of descending creditworthiness. The defendant conceded that the letter

was defamatory. The plaintiff contended that it was made with malice because it was made

recklessly. The plaintiff relied on the proposition that "(W)here a defendant has

allowed himself to get into a state in which he is reckless as to whether what he

publishes is true or false, he is treated as if he has stated what he knows to be

false." - <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (8<sup>th</sup> Edn) para 774.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        Was the defendant reckless? The defendant had

written the letter on the basis of the credit report. It read more into the report than

was justified. It could have been more careful, but it was not so careless as to be

considered reckless. In this regard, it is apposite to refer to Lord Esher M.R.’s

words in <i>Royal Aquarium v Parkinson</i> [1892] 1 QB 431 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If a person from anger or some

    other wrong motive has allowed his mind to get into such a state as to make him cast

    aspersions on other people, reckless whether they are true or false, it has been held, and

    I think rightly held … that he abused the occasion …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There was no suggestion that the

defendant intended to injure the plaintiff when it sent the letter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        The plaintiff also submitted that the

defendant’s malice can be inferred because it did not issue an apology for the letter

till 16 Aug 2002. I will be careful in drawing such an inference. The delay may be the

defendant’s decision-making process, or its belief in the truth of the statement, or

its disagreement that the statement should be read in the manner the plaintiff read it. As

there is nothing to show that the defendant withheld or delayed the apology to prolong the

injury it caused, I will not draw the inference.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        The plaintiff did not pursue the assertion that

the defendant was motivated by the intention to withdraw from the sub-contract because its

price was too low, as there was no evidence of that.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        I therefore find that the defence of qualified

privilege succeeds with regard to the publication to the architect, employer, M&amp;E

consultant, but not for publication to the quantity surveyor. I order that the defendant

pays damages to the plaintiff, and that the damages be assessed by the registrar.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Whether there was a binding

sub-contract</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        It was not disputed that a signed sub-contract

was contemplated and that no such agreement was signed. The plaintiff contended that a

sub-contract came into being on 18 Jan 2002, while the defendant’s position was that

there was no sub-contract till it was signed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        A review of the contemporaneous documents will

help to determine which position is correct. The starting point is the defendant’s

tender offer dated 18 Oct 2001 in the form furnished by the architect. The offer was

addressed to the employer and stated that</font></p>

        The defendant was informed by the M&amp;E

consultant that its bid was accepted. The consultant informed the defendant in its letter

of 5 Dec 2001</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        The architect also informed the plaintiff of

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.

        Two points stand out in these documents. First,

there was the consistent reference to the execution of a formal contract, and no

indication of the formation of a sub-contract between the plaintiff and the defendant at

any time before that.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.

        Second, the defendant’s tender offer in

the form furnished by the architect provided that until the execution of a formal

agreement, the tender and the employer’s letter of acceptance constituted a binding

contract between it and the employer. Consequently when the letter of 5 Dec 2001 was

issued, there was a binding agreement between the defendant and the employer which was to

be replaced by a sub-contract between the defendant and the plaintiff when the formal

agreement is executed. If there was also a sub-contract between the defendant and the

plaintiff prior to the execution of the formal agreement, the defendant would have similar

contracts with the employer as well as the plaintiff at the same time. This cannot be the

intention of the parties.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        The plaintiff argued that the M&amp;E

consultant’s letter was not the Letter of Acceptance, that it was no more than a

letter of intent (as the letter was captioned) by the M&amp;E consultant which was not

stated to be written on behalf of the employer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.

        This argument ignored some important facts. The

letter was issued by the M&amp;E consultant specifically in response to the

defendant’s tender submission. Furthermore the letter referred to "this letter

of award" and "this Letter of Award". Counsel did not venture to suggest

what was awarded if it was not the sub-contract for the FPI works. The letter can only be

fairly construed as a letter of acceptance. If it was not, it would appear that the

defendant’s tender offer was never accepted by the employer, and that was not

consistent with the plaintiff’s own case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.

        Nevertheless the plaintiff’s case is that

there was a contract between itself and the defendant despite the absence of the formal

agreement. It argued that by 18 Jan the terms of the sub-contract were settled, and there

were no further terms to be resolved, and when the plaintiff appointed the defendant as

the sub-contractor, a contract was formed. This argument overlooked the fact that the

letter of 5 Dec identifying the form of sub-contract was not from the plaintiff. It was

issued by the M&amp;E consultant on behalf of the employer, with no reference to the

plaintiff. Although the parties in the tendering process were aware of the form of the

sub-contract to be entered into, there was nothing which points to an agreement between

the plaintiff and the defendant to enter into the sub-contract between themselves in that

form.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.

        The plaintiff also submitted that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In respect of building contracts,

    the entering into a formal contract in the future does not prevent a contract from being

    formed if the material terms are settled and work commences at the site. In building

    contracts the parties often provide that a formal contract will be executed in the future.

    Unlike conveyancing practice for instance, the building contract will come into effect

    once all the terms have been settled and work commences at the site.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.

        That is partly correct. The requirement for

signing a formal contract may be just that – a formality. But it may be more than

that, and it is necessary in each case to consider all the circumstances to decide if an

agreement has come into being without the formal document. However it is wrong to contend

without such consideration that an agreement will<i> </i>come into effect, as it is wrong

to say that it will not. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.

        We should not apply contractual rules

differently to different activities. Parties engaged in all activities should conduct

their affairs in compliance with the rules, and should not expect that the rules be

adapted for them. The parties had intended that there was to be a signed agreement. They

had not stated expressly or impliedly that there was to be a sub-contract before or

without a signed agreement, or that the execution of the agreement was a matter of

formality only.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.

        Counsel submitted that the parties to a

building contract may be more concerned with the execution of the contracted works than

the contract document, and are apt to delay or overlook the execution of the contract.

Even if that were so, the rules do not have to be applied differently. There are existing

rules which can assist an aggrieved and deserving party, particularly the rules of waiver

and estoppel. If indeed the parties had acted on the basis that there was a concluded

contract, neither of them should be allowed to evade liability because the formal

agreement was not signed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.

        But that was not the plaintiff’s case, and

waiver and estoppel were not raised. If they were pleaded, was either established? The

defendant was informed that it was selected on 5 Dec. On 18 Jan the plaintiff appointed

the defendant as its nominated sub-contractor. On 18 Feb, the defendant requested for a

change in the payment terms. It did not make any representation to the plaintiff that it

would enter into a sub-contract with it. To the contrary, it gave notice that without the

change it would not enter into the sub-contract, and no sub-contract was forwarded for it

to execute. There can be no waiver or estoppel in the circumstances, or anything which

rendered the execution of an agreement unnecessary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.

        On the evidence before me, I find that there

was no binding sub-contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. With this finding,

the claim for damages for breach of contract fails. I will add that even if there was a

sub-contract and it was wrongly repudiated by the defendant, there were shortcomings in

the plaintiff’s presentation of its claims.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.

        The plaintiff’s claim was particularised

as</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.

        It transpired at the hearing that the scope of

the replacement sub-contract was identical to that offered to the defendant. That is not

right because the defendant had carried out some of the FPI works. The replacement

sub-contract ought not include those works, and the plaintiff cannot claim the difference

in the two contracts from the defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45.

        There was no evidence of the works alleged to

have been carried out on behalf of the defendant, and no explanation why this sum should

be treated as an additional item to the sub-contracted works. There was no confirmation by

the architect, M&amp;E consultant, quantity surveyor or any other party to confirm that

those works were works which the defendant should have executed. Besides showing a claim

by Air &amp; Air Engineering Pte Ltd for $2,400 submitted to the plaintiff for approval,

there was no evidence that the work was done or that the claim was approved or paid.

Similarly with regard to the claim for $4,380 for rectification works, there was only a

fax message from the replacement sub-contractor referring to the work which required

rectification, with a quotation therefor submitted to the plaintiff. There was no

confirmation that these were proper rectification works, or that they were executed, or

that the amount of $4,380 was reasonable or paid. The claims were not properly proved.</font></p>

        The plaintiff’s action succeeds on libel,

but fails on breach of contract. I will defer my order on costs pending the assessment of

damages.</font></p>
