The third and fifth charges were stood down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first accused faced two charges but the prosecution only proceeded with the second charge against him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first charge was stood down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These four accused persons together with a fifth person, were scheduled for trial before Justice Kan Ting Chiu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The scheduled trial was interrupted because the four accused indicated that they wished to plead guilty to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> some of the charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They thus appeared before me to be dealt with on those charges.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The case against the accused persons were connected in this way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> first accused was charged with the rape of a 13-year old female under s 3761) of the Penal Code. The second, third, and fourth accused were charged with abetment by conspiracy, in procuring men to rape the same 13-year old female, under s 376(1) of the Penal Code read with s 109.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was the amended seventh charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fourth and sixth charges related to procuring the same 13-year old for the purposes of prostitution, under s 140(1)(b) of the Women’s Charter, and living off the earnings of prostitution, under s 146(1) of the Women’s Charter.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> When the plea was taken all four initially indicated that they were pleading guilty to the charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only Thankappan (the second accused) was represented by counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first accused then addressed me saying that when he had sex with the girl he did not know that she was under 14 years of age and that he paid her for the sexual act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the circumstances, it appears to me that his plea is sufficiently qualified and ought to be rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The third accused also qualified his plea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, therefore, rejected the plea of guilt of the first and third accused persons, and proceeded with the case against the second and fourth accused persons.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The central figure in this case was the first accused, so if he is not found to be guilty of any offence a conviction against his abettors may ostensibly appear bizarre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it is not necessary so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the charge of abetment is one of conspiracy, the offence which was the subject of the conspiracy need not have been completed for the conspirators to be guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not a requirement that the principal offender is convicted before his abettors may be dealt with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The abettors can be dealt with even where the principal offender is never caught.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, there is room for improving the procedure in some of these cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Standing down the charges against the abettors until the trial of the principal offender is one way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, if the court decides that the abettors or co-accused ought to be dealt with first, and separately, then the court dealing with the abettors and co-accused will have to proceed on the basis of the case as it is presented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first and third accused have been remitted for trial and are no longer a matter of comment from this court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whatever the result may be of their trial, it is best remembered that every case is but a mere pastiche in the vast canvas of case law, each unto its own, unified where consistency permits, but stands alone otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the present case, the accused persons before me admitted to conspiring to procure men to have sex with a 13-year old girl in circumstances that they admit amounted to rape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Statement of Facts reveals that the 13-year old girl was taken from her home in Malaysia under the false pretence of bringing her to Singapore as a maid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When she arrived, she was forced into prostitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With these facts admitted by the accused, I accepted their plea of guilt and convicted them accordingly. I should note, for completeness, that the admission of the facts was also implicitly, but clearly, an admission that there was no consent from the young girl to perform the sexual acts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The offence of abetment of rape of a 13-year old girl is almost as serious as if the abettors had each been the actual rapist, but, in sentencing the abettors, the court is entitled to take into account that those offenders who had not forced themselves physically on the girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus, bearing in mind the general opinion of the court in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP</i> [1992] 1 SLR 361, and applying them with adjustments to the facts of the present case, I am of the view that a term of imprisonment of 11 years is appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of the matters that require emphasis here is the commitment of the courts towards the deterrence of sexual offences against young children, especially where they are subjected to prostitution, and drained not only of their innocence, but also of their money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I thus sentenced the two accused to 11 years imprisonment, and also six strokes of the cane in respect of the second accused for the amended seventh charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had considered whether the sentence of imprisonment in respect of the fourth accused should be higher since no caning may be inflicted on her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, I am of the view that an adjustment upwards is not necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have also taken into account the fact that these two accused had pleaded guilty to the charges, a plea of guilt in this instance had spared the child from the rigours and ordeal of trial.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> An offence under s 140(1)(b) and s 146(1) of the Women’s Charter is punishable with imprisonment of up to five years and also with a fine not exceeding $10,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In view of the fact that both accused were first offenders, and taking into account the totality of the overall sentences I am of the view that a term of imprisonment of one year and a fine of $5,000 is sufficient in respect of each of the accused. The sentences of imprisonment under s 140(1)(b) and s 146(1) are to run concurrently but consecutively to that under the term of imprisonment ordered under s 376(1) of the Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In default of payment of fine the accused will serve six months for each fine unpaid.</span></p>
