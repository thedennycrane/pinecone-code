GIS took instructions on how the boreholes were to be drilled and how much to offset when its drilling encountered obstructions (GD at [19]). The statutory defence in s 56A of the PUA was not available to the Appellant as the offence was committed due to its negligence. The Appellant did not ascertain the exact alignment of water mains in the vicinity and simply instructed GIS to dig a trial hole and hand augur to a depth of 3m. Contrary to PUB’s warnings, the Appellant also failed to consult PUB when the water mains that were shown in the PUB Plan to be in the vicinity were not detected when the trial hole was carried out (GD at [25]–[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I had allowed the appeal on the question of the Appellant’s responsibility for GIS’s drilling.

Such liability can only be avoided if the secondary offender can establish two conjunctive requirements on a balance of probabilities: (a) that the primary offence was committed without the secondary offender’s consent or connivance; and (b) that the primary offence was not attributable to any neglect on the part of the secondary offender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, the primary offence allegedly committed was the damage caused to water mains, contrary to s 47A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PUA. At the time of the alleged offence in 2015, that section read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">47A.</span>—(1)  Any person who, whether wilfully or otherwise, removes, destroys or damages or causes or permits to be removed, destroyed or damaged, any water main belonging to or under the management or control of the Board, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if the water main is 300 mm or more in diameter, to a fine not exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The primary offence is thus committed so long as damage is caused to a water main of 300 mm or more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is common ground that the primary offence here was committed without the consent or connivance of the Appellant.

The accused person, who was the resident non-executive director of a company, faced charges under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 47(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA for the company’s transfer of stolen moneys out of Singapore being attributable to his neglect as its officer. The accused person had assisted in incorporating a number of companies in Singapore on behalf of foreign acquaintances and acted as their resident director since their other directors were not ordinarily resident in Singapore. The accused person assisted in setting up bank accounts for one of these companies, WEL. There were certain warning signs which came to the attention of the accused person, the most important being that one of the companies was being investigated for money laundering. Eventually, numerous deposits and withdrawals took place in one of WEL’s bank accounts, a number of which were eventually determined to be of stolen moneys.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 WEL was proved to have committed an offence under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA by transferring the benefits of criminal conduct out of Singapore. The accused person was convicted as a secondary offender under s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offences by bodies corporate, etc. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59.—(1) Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to have been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) to be attributable to any neglect on his part, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the officer as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In finding that the offences committed by WEL were attributable to the neglect of the accused person, Chan Seng Onn J adopted the following approach to s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA (at [63]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To prove neglect, it must be shown that the officer knew or ought to have known of the existence of facts requiring him to take steps which fell within the scope of the functions of his role to prevent the commission of the offence by the company, and that he failed to take such steps. In assessing the state of his knowledge and the scope of action which he allegedly neglected to perform, the functions of his office will be a relevant consideration. The more remote his office from the facts surrounding the offence, the more difficult it is to infer that the officer was negligent, and hence stronger evidence would be required of the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Chan J’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani</span> calls for a consideration of the accused person’s functions within the company which committed the primary offence.  The closer the accused person’s functions are to the facts of the primary offence, the easier it will be for the Prosecution to show that the officer failed to take steps falling within the scope of his functions to prevent the commission of the primary offence. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani</span>, even though the accused person was a non-executive director, he was still subject to duties imposed on directors by the common law and statute (at [65]). The numerous warning signs relating to WEL’s activities ought to have put the accused person on notice, and his failure to take any active steps to investigate or adopt preventive action meant that the CDSA charges were proven beyond a reasonable doubt (at [64]–[78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The statutory language in s 56A of the PUA and s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA are certainly similar. Both provisions impose secondary liability on an accused person for an offence committed by another. That being said, two observations are pertinent. First, an offence under s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the primary offence was attributable to neglect on the part of the officer). This is in contrast to s 56A of the PUA, which places the burden of proof on the secondary offender to show that on a balance of probabilities, the primary offence committed by someone under its supervision or instruction was not attributable to its neglect. Second, the <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani</span> approach is concerned with the actions of officers of a body corporate. This would appear narrower than s 56A of the PUA, which is not dependent on the accused person holding any post or office in the primary offender. The basis for imposing criminal liability under s 56A of the PUA, in contrast to s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA, is the ability of the secondary offender to supervise or instruct the primary offender (whether such ability arises out of an agency, employer-employee or other relationship).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 To my mind, these differences make it such that the <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani</span> approach, while a useful guide, cannot be directly transposed to offences under s 56A of the PUA. Rather, certain amendments should be adopted to address the specific statutory provision at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In determining whether secondary liability ought to be imposed under s 56A of the PUA, the court analyses whether, upon consideration of the entire context, the primary offence committed was attributable to any neglect on the part of the alleged secondary offender. In ascertaining the relevant context, the focal points of the inquiry are: (a) the degree of supervision and instruction exercised, or which should have been exercised, by the alleged secondary offender over the primary offender; and (b) the facts which the alleged secondary offender knew or ought to have known about.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>This is similar to the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani </span>in relation to s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA, where the functions of the office the alleged secondary offender holds in the company (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the primary offender) serve as a yardstick against which his actions are measured in determining whether the offence committed by the primary offender is attributable to his neglect (see [36] above). After all, neglect or negligence must be measured against some standard of what constitutes appropriate conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In this regard, any contracts entered into between the primary and secondary offenders, as well as between them and other parties involved in the incident (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the PUB), would certainly form a key part of the context against which the court assesses whether a primary offence is attributable to an accused person’s neglect. Such contracts would demonstrate: (a) the scope of the work to be completed and the degree of supervision or instruction exercised over the primary offender; and (b) the risks or dangers inherent in the project. That is not to say that any contracts would be determinative of the ambit of statutory obligations, accompanied by criminal consequences, imposed on a secondary offender. The breach of a private agreement cannot, without more, result in criminal liability, even if the other contracting party is a public utility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The next step calls for a consideration of whether the alleged secondary offender has proven on a balance of probabilities that the primary offence committed was not attributable to any neglect on its part. This can be done by showing that reasonable steps were taken to avoid the harm which was caused by the primary offence. In determining whether steps taken by the alleged secondary offender were reasonable, the relevant context (which would have been determined by this stage) is crucial. The evidence required for the statutory defence to be made out would inevitably be lower where the alleged secondary offender only exercises minimal supervision or instruction over the primary offender. In the same vein, more evidence is required of measures taken to guard against harm which the secondary offender knows or ought to know has a high risk of occurring.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevant context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As mentioned above at [39]–[40], the first step in the inquiry is to ascertain the relevant context. Starting first with the degree of supervision and instruction, I am of the view that the Appellant clearly exercised a significant degree of control over the primary offenders in this case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Gam and Parvez). Gam and Parvez were employed by GIS, a subcontractor engaged by the Appellant to drill some of the boreholes it was contractually obligated to drill under its contract with the PUB. Gam’s evidence in the trial below was that he and Parvez were both subject to the instructions of Min, the Appellant’s site coordinator.

As I understand it, the Appellant’s argument is that Yin and Min exercised supervision and instruction over the primary offenders, rather than the Appellant. I am not persuaded by this argument. What must be considered in determining whether the defence is made out is whether the Appellant exercised the appropriate degree of supervision. In this context, as was noted by the District Judge in the GD at [19], GIS was employed by the Appellant as a subcontractor to carry out the drilling of boreholes. In the course of this arrangement, GIS was to take instructions from the Appellant. Yin and Min were employees of the Appellant tasked with instructing GIS and its employees on the drilling of the boreholes.

They may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Consulting with the PUB-appointed consultant BV/AECOM on the Offset Location.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Drilling at the Offset Location to ensure that drilling was conducted further away from any water mains shown on the PUB Plan.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Adhering to the prevalent industry practice of digging a trial hole to a depth of 1.5m, before using a manual hand auger to a depth of 3m.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The manner of drilling was entirely dependent on the drilling operator and the drill bit used was made out of tungsten.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ensuring that GIS and its employees heeded all instructions from the PUB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Appellant also pointed to the fact that it would be absurd to require the Appellant to consult the PUB every time a trial hole is dug, and that the PUB Plans were inaccurate. To my mind, these facts do not go any way to assisting the Appellant in discharging its burden to make out the statutory defence on a balance of probabilities. At best, they simply form part of the context against which the Appellant’s actions are assessed to determine whether reasonable steps were taken to avoid the harm caused by the primary offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The matters discussed above (at [45]) should have raised red flags that water mains or other underground structures were not necessarily in the locations that would have been expected from the PUB Plan, and that caution would have to be exercised. Given the degree of supervision and instruction exercised over GIS and its employees by the Appellant, I accept the arguments of the Prosecution that remedial steps ought to have been taken given the risk that water mains may run beneath the intended location of the Borehole. These steps would have included those that were raised by the Prosecution, namely to contact the PUB, and to discuss the matter with the PUB-appointed consultant BV/AECOM.

</div> Indeed, if consultations had been held with PUB or its agents, and damage occurs thereafter, it would be hard I should think for it to be shown that there was neglect on the part of the Appellant.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>It is not necessary for the Prosecution to establish that such discussions would definitely have prevented the occurrence of the drilling which resulted in the primary offence. What these measures would have shown is that care was at least taken, which could reasonably have led to a different course of action, and thus some possibility of avoiding the harm caused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Appellant alleges that it had discussed with BV/AECOM about the Offset Location. However, the District Judge had found in the trial below that no such discussion had taken place (GD at [25]). The Appellant makes no argument other than to say that any evidence of a failure to consult with BV/AECOM is hearsay.

</div> No witnesses had testified that these discussions had taken place. The documentary evidence, far from supporting the Appellant’s case, in fact suggests that BV/AECOM was at most only informed, rather than consulted, of the decision to drill at the Offset Location.

</div>
</div> In the circumstances, I am of the view that there is nothing suggesting that the District Judge’s finding was against the weight of evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Appellant also argues that it took precautions by drilling at the Offset Location, which was further away from any water mains shown on the PUB Plan (see [16] above). Again, I do not think this is sufficient to discharge its burden of proof. Given the surrounding factual matrix, particularly the fact that an obstruction was encountered while drilling the Borehole on 15 March 2015 (see [45(d)] above), the Appellant should have proceeded with great caution. Drilling elsewhere would of course have been a possible step taken in response to this development, and may have been evidence that there was no neglect. But where the drilling is done is important. Consideration and assessment must be shown, such that the new location is established to be one with little or much lower risk of causing damage to water mains. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The steps taken by the Appellant were not sufficient. The Appellant decided to direct GIS to drill at the Offset Location, but the offset was done without physical checks. As mentioned above at [8],<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>the Offset Location was determined simply by offsetting the original location of the Borehole by 600mm in the direction of a nearby Canal. There is no evidence to show that there was any consideration of whether this was an appropriate offset to minimise the risk of damage to water mains, and how the direction and other details were determined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Turning next to the fact that the Appellant had adhered to industry practices in digging trial holes, I do not think that it is sufficient to make out the statutory defence. As a starting point, I would note that a particular practice may be negligent even if it is common: <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani </span>at [90]–[91]. However, what is more pertinent in this case is that the primary offence which the court is concerned with in the present case was caused by drilling at the Offset Location. That the Appellant may have taken appropriate measures in other respects is simply not relevant to the question at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As for the Appellant’s remaining arguments, I do not think that they take it very far. The statutory defence requires that the Appellant prove that the primary offence caused was not attributable to <span class="font-italic">any </span>neglect on its part. Given that the other evidence points to the Appellant having failed to take appropriate steps to prevent the commission of the primary offence (see [46]–[51] above), I am satisfied that the Appellant has failed to make out the statutory defence under s 56A of the PUA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 At this juncture, I will also address some of the points raised by the Appellant. Much was made by the Appellant about the fact that the PUB did not possess information about the location of nearby water mains, with the PUB Plan reflecting incorrect locations.

</div>
</div>
</div> But that is not a sufficient answer. While it does seem odd that the national agency responsible for the water system did not itself seem to know where the water mains were (and one would expect the PUB to know more than the Appellant), that is not the focus of the inquiry in the present case. The Appellant was the party on the ground supervising and instructing the primary offenders, and knew or ought to have known that there was a risk of damage being caused to a water main. As noted above, the Appellant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence by the primary offenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Appellant also refers to the impact an adverse decision would have.  The argument appears to be that imposing liability in this situation would have an adverse impact on those involved in drilling. The counter to this would simply be that the consequences of such impact, such as increased cost in engaging such persons, or a dearth of such persons providing these services, would be a distinct matter from any culpability under the PUA. The determination of whether an offence was committed, including whether a defence is available, cannot be linked to the possible adverse consequences: if on the proper interpretation, the criminal law requires the court to take a particular line, that line has to be taken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 These adverse consequences are not sufficient to compel the adoption of a less demanding interpretation of the provisions, overriding the clear meaning that should be given to the word ‘neglect’. In any event, if such adverse consequences do come to pass, then that is a matter to be addressed by the legislature. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the above reasons, I find that the Appellant has not made out the statutory defence under s 56A of the PUA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On this basis, it would follow therefore that the original appeal, following the ruling of the Court of Appeal on the question of the culpability of the Appellant for the actions of the primary offenders, would have to be dismissed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Given that neither party has appealed against the sentence, there is no reason to disturb the sentence of a $50,000 fine imposed by the District Judge.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Faizal Shah Bin Mohamed Haniffa, Vigneesh s/o Nainar and Khairul Ashraf Bin Khairul Anwar (Shah Eigen LLC) for the appellant; <br/>Ang Feng Qian, Gabriel Choong and Jane Lim (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
