Within this issue, there are several sub-issues. These are whether Board authorisation was required; whether there was any contractual obligation requiring the defendant to make the Payments; whether the plaintiff failed to ensure that the contractual milestones set out in the Three Letters were met; and in particular, whether the defendant failed to ensure that DWS obtained the necessary documents to perform due diligence on the Solar Project and if DWS completed satisfactory due diligence for the Solar Project. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the defendant should have procured the recovery of the Payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Before dealing with these issues in turn, I briefly set out the law concerning a director’s duties to a company. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of director’s duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The company-director relationship is a well-established category of fiduciary relationship. A director is to act honestly and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of the company: see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law </span>(Tan Cheng Han SC, gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 8.16.  The test in respect of this duty is both subjective and objective. The subjective element lies in the court’s consideration of whether the director had exercised his discretion <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in what he considered was in the interests of the company while the objective test requires an assessment of whether an intelligent and honest man in the position of a director of a company concerned could, in the whole of the existing circumstances, have reasonably believed that the transactions were for the benefit of the company: see <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 592 at [35] and [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Directors also owe a duty of care, skill and diligence to their company.

The standard of care, skill and diligence expected of a director is subject to a minimum objective standard which entails the obligation to take reasonable steps to place oneself in a position to guide and monitor the management of the company: see <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”) at [137]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Section 157(1) of the CA also imposes duties on directors. These statutory duties to act honestly and reasonably are largely similar in content and scope as the abovementioned duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As set out at [16] above, the plaintiff pleads a wide range of duties owed by the defendant. However, based on the nature of the alleged breaches, it is primarily the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the interests of the company, and the duty of care, skill and diligence, which are engaged. In particular, while a director is clearly proscribed from profiting from his fiduciary position, and from putting himself in a position where his own interests and his duty to his principal are in conflict (<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [135]), there is no allegation that the defendant did so. With that, I turn to the allegations in relation to the Water Project. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant breached his duties in respect of the Water Project </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Framework Agreement and the payment of the Deposit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is undisputed that the defendant caused the plaintiff to enter the Framework Agreement as well as make payment of the Deposit.

This means that the defendant was not required under the Group Charter to obtain approval from the Board to enter into the Framework Agreement. I would further add that even if it were the case that the Group Charter did not only apply to contracts involving acquisitions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it applies to the Framework Agreement), it remains the case that Board approval would not be required because the value involved in Framework Agreement did not exceed S$20m (see [50] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether Board approval was required for the payment of the Deposit</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I now turn to the payment of the Deposit as required under the Framework Agreement.

</div> Apart from the MyLoc Drinking Water Plant, there were two other “greenfield” projects, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>projects which have not been built by Canwaco, that went towards the defendant’s estimation of the value of Canwaco to be worth over US$13m. The Deposit, being between 5% to 10% of the total value of the Water Project, was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I accept the defendant’s explanation. The Framework Agreement was for the intended purchase of equity interest in Canwaco and not just the MyLoc Drinking Plant. Canwaco’s value could therefore include the two “greenfield” projects. This coheres with cl 5 of the Framework Agreement that provides for technical due diligence. As the defendant explains, this necessarily refers to the two “greenfield” projects because the MyLoc Drinking Water Plant was already in operation and would not require due diligence.

</div> Accordingly, I find that the quantum of the Deposit, which was derived from the value of Canwaco, was not unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I move on to the recipient of the Deposit. The plaintiff contends that the defendant acted recklessly by making payment to CA Trading on the basis that it is a Vietnamese company. I find insufficient basis for the plaintiff to make this allegation. I note the commercial relationship between the defendant, Mr Dao and CA Trading. Mr Dao was a consultant for the plaintiff and worked with the plaintiff on four to five separate projects apart from the Water Project at the material time.

</div> This forms the backdrop against which the defendant stated that he trusted Mr Dao and that he was confident that he could recover the Deposit if the need arose. In any event, the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence to suggest that Mr Dao and CA Trading were unreliable partners. It seems to me that the plaintiff’s position was quite untenable.

</div> In any event, the evidence of Ms Tan suggests that the technical issues faced were not so severe to warrant the defendant’s intervention at that point in time. Ms Tan opined that the salinity of the water would have become a dealbreaker only after 2020. By then, the salinity of the water should have been mitigated by measures implemented.

</div> This, in fact, appears to be what happened. On 7 August 2020, the plaintiff withdrew from the Water Project on the basis that technical issues could not be resolved. This connotes that due diligence was not completed until well after the defendant’s departure from the plaintiff. Given the plaintiff’s own treatment of the technical issue, it cannot be said that the defendant was unjustified in allowing the due diligence process to continue at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As for the financial findings of Draft Mazars Report, I agree that they were not so damning to require the defendant to obtain a refund.

Parties disagree as to whether the defendant required approval from the Board. Based on my observations concerning the Group Charter at [38], I find that that no approval was required. As stated, the Group Charter is operative. By the Group Charter, Board approval is required for contracts involving acquisitions of a value greater than S$20m. The Payments were made pursuant to the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter, which is a preliminary agreement to facilitate the entry into the Solar Project SPA. By itself, it does not involve any acquisitions. Accordingly, I find that Board approval was not required for entry into the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter or for the Payments to be made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether there were any contractual obligations requiring the defendant to make the Payments</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff’s position is that the defendant authorised the Payments in the absence of any contractual obligations requiring him to do so.

</div> The plaintiff’s argument, however, is unmeritorious. It erroneously assumes that contractual obligations arise only with the Solar Project SPA. However, payments may be legitimately made to a counterparty in the early stages of a project as a demonstration of good faith or commitment, as was done in the Water Project, by way of the Framework Agreement, and in the Solar Project by way of the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Indeed, the Payments were made to facilitate processes such as due diligence with the aim of assessing whether to proceed with the Solar Project. The defendant’s argument is borne out by the evidence. In fact, in cross-examination, Ms Tan stated that the signing of the letters of intent began the “tentative step to discover whether or not this acquisition will be undertaken by the company or not”.

</div> The defendant’s position is also consonant with the plain language of the Three Letters. I, therefore, disagree with the plaintiff’s contention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Further, I observe that the basic requirements for a legally enforceable agreement are present in the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter. Pertinently, there is consideration. For the provision of documents for review and the opportunity to enter into the Solar Project SPA, DWS is to pay a commitment fee. In fact, in arguing that the defendant should have recovered the Payments, the plaintiff is relying on DWS’s rights under cl 3 of the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter, which is an obligation imposed on CDGE, and thus contrary to this argument. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether the defendant ensured the contractual milestones in the Three Letters were met before authorising the Payments</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I begin by determining what contractual milestones are imposed by the Three Letters. Presumably, by contractual milestones, the plaintiff is referring to any conditions or obligations to be fulfilled before authorising the Payments. In my view, only the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter is relevant. The 19 October 2018 LOI is an unsigned document which bears no weight in the legal relationship between DWS and CDGE.

In other words, the conditions precedent and conditions subsequent in the 30 October 2018 LOI ought to be read together with the payment schedule set out in the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter. Indeed, the defendant’s understanding is that the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter had the effect of “fine-tuning” the 30 October 2018 LOI and the two should be read together.

</div> For all intents and purposes, the First Payment was entirely in accord with cl 1(a). Further keeping in mind that the Solar Project was to be executed via DWS, of which Mr Zach Thye was the managing director, I find that the defendant was entitled to rely on Mr Zach Thye to ensure that cl 1(a) was met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 As for the defendant’s failure to conduct due diligence, it is unrealistic to expect the defendant to have done so before authorising the First Payment.  The purpose of the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter is to, among other things, facilitate due diligence, as evinced from cll 1(b) and 1(c). Against this backdrop, the defendant cannot be faulted for not conducting due diligence by then. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Second Payment</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiff argues that the defendant authorised this payment knowing that an entity known as Terrawood, and not CDGE, was in possession of certain critical documents for the Solar Project.

</div> The defendant’s position, again, is that Mr Zach Thye authorised the payment. The defendant also accepts that he was aware as of 28 December 2018 via email correspondence that Terrawood held certain critical documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80  From the outset, the plaintiff’s argument suffers from a lack of particularity. The plaintiff grounds their argument in the defendant’s authorisation despite his knowledge that Terrawood held certain documents. Yet, it is unclear what was expected of the defendant in these circumstances. During the cross-examination of the defendant, the plaintiff intimated that the defendant should have reviewed certain documents. Yet, nothing more was pleaded or argued on this front. It remains unclear what the defendant should have reviewed. For instance, would an update from Mr Teh informing the defendant that all relevant documents were received have sufficed? Or would the defendant have been required to review all documents personally? The point here is that the plaintiff has not shown what the defendant failed to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The plaintiff also fails to demonstrate that the conditions in cl 1(b) were not met. The Second Payment was made on 9 January 2019. This is approximately two weeks after the defendant learnt via email correspondence that certain documents were not held by CDGE. It is unclear what happened in the intervening period. Critically, no evidence was led by the plaintiff to show that these critical documents remained missing by 9 January 2019. In fact, the documentary evidence appears to suggest otherwise. Following the email dated 28 December 2018, Mr Dao replied on 29 December 2018 stating that two out of three key requirements for the Solar Project, namely the in-principle approval to purchase electricity from EVN, the electric authority in Vietnam,

In response to inquiries raised by Mr Dao on 26 December 2018, Ms Tan indicated that Mr Zach Thye would be providing the input for the Solar Project. On 29 December 2021, Mr Zach Thye, again, took the lead in seeking further documents from Mr Dao in respect of cl 1(b).

</div> This demonstrates his oversight and management of the Solar Project. That this is so is unsurprising given the evidence of both Ms Tan and Mr Teh that Mr Zach Thye took charge of the due diligence process as well as that cl 1(b) concerns the provision of documents to DWS, not the plaintiff. Based on the above, I find it was not unreasonable for the defendant to rely on Mr Zach Thye to ensure that all documents required under cl 1(b) were received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 As for the plaintiff’s claim that that the real reason the defendant authorised the payment was to fund Mr Dao’s buyout of “Mr Luc”, I find this to be a bare assertion. While the defendant was aware of Mr Dao’s intention, this does not mean that he authorised the payment for this reason. There is no evidence to that effect. Instead, the defendant steadfastly stated that the payment was authorised because Mr Zach Thye was satisfied with the list of documents required for due diligence. For the remaining issue concerning the proposed acquisition of Terrawood and CDGE, in so far as the defendant is concerned, he understood the nature and consequence of the proposal, and was able to explain the commercial basis for such a move in the context of the Solar Project. The plaintiff has insufficient basis to dispute that the defendant approved the release of the payment for DWS to carry on with the Solar Project.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Third Payment </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The plaintiff contends that the defendant failed to ensure that due diligence was fulfilled despite having oversight of the Solar Project.

</div> While the defendant gave authorisation on 14 February 2019, Mr Teh did not immediately release the moneys to Mr Dao. Instead, Mr Teh checked with Mr Zach Thye whether payment could be made to Mr Dao. Only upon Mr Zach Thye’s approval did Mr Teh prepare the payment. This suggests that Mr Zach Thye’s, and not the defendant’s, authorisation was critical. This is also consistent with the First and Second Payments where payments were only made <span class="font-italic">after </span>Mr Zach Thye gave authorisation, as well as Mr Teh’s evidence that he was instructed to <span class="font-italic">defer</span> to the instructions of Mr Zach Thye for the Payments.

As such, I disagree that the defendant was responsible for due diligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I now turn to the issue of whether the defendant did enough to ensure that cl 1(c) was fulfilled. The plaintiff’s argument suffers, once again, from the same deficiencies as highlighted in relation to the Second Payment. It is unclear what is required of the defendant in this particular instance. The plaintiff has not demonstrated what the defendant has <span class="font-italic">failed</span> to do. This is especially so given that DWS is clearly front and centre in the due diligence process. Clause 1(c) requires DWS to be satisfied with the due diligence process while cl 1(b), which cl 1(c) is predicated on, requires documents necessary for due diligence to be provided to DWS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Moreover, there is no evidence to show that cl 1(c) was not fulfilled, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that DWS was not<span class="font-italic"> </span>satisfied with the due diligence conducted on the Solar Project. In the Internal Audit Report concerning the Solar Project, the plaintiff explained that they sought to sell the Solar Project because of a change in management and that the “withdrawal was not due to unsatisfactory [sic] of the due diligence”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was understood by Mr Teh and Ms Tan to mean that nothing unsatisfactory was found in the due diligence process. I note that it can also be inferred from the plaintiff’s attempt to sell their interest in the Solar Project that the due diligence process was satisfactory. For a sale to occur, the plaintiff must necessarily acquire an interest in the Solar Project. This suggests that the plaintiff was ready to enter into the Solar Project SPA as per cl 1(d) of the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter, which indicates that cl 1(c) was fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In sum, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant did not discharge his duties in authorising the Payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Payments were objectively in the best interests of the plaintiff. They were meant to facilitate the eventual entering of the Solar Project SPA and the Power Purchase Agreement by DWS. They were not meant to benefit Mr Dao (to enable him to pay one “Mr Luc” for his shares in CDGE). As the defendant highlights, the Power Purchase Agreement is essential to the success of the Solar Project as it would be the primary means of revenue. In turn, the success of the Solar Project would generate a new stream of revenue for DWS (and therefore for the plaintiff). Accordingly, I find both the objective and subjective elements of the duty to act honestly and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the best interests of a company to be fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The defendant’s reliance on Mr Zach Thye to ensure that the conditions were met is also reasonable. This is especially so given that the evidence shows that the conditions for all Three Payments appear to be fulfilled and no allegations have been raised against Mr Zach Thye, who was primarily responsible for the Solar Project, for authorising these payments in breach of the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter. Thus, the defendant has also acted reasonably, and with due care, skill and diligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Even if, <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, the defendant was in breach of his duty to act reasonably, or with due care, skill and diligence, when he authorised the payments, the plaintiff would have to demonstrate an unbroken chain of causation leading from the defendant’s breach to the losses suffered: see <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon </span>at [142]. The loss of US$600,000 suffered by the plaintiff was caused by its withdrawal from the Solar Project. Had the Solar Project continued, the Payments would have gone towards the acquisition of CDGE and not materialized as losses. Eventually, the withdrawal was not due to any of the breaches of the conditions in the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter, such as dissatisfactory due diligence. Instead, it was based on commercial reasons. In this connection, it seems to me that the defendant’s breaches would have been immaterial as the losses were independent of them, and accordingly, the plaintiff cannot show an unbroken chain of causation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Recovery of the Payments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I turn next to the plaintiff’s contention that the defendant should have recovered the Payments as no due diligence was conducted and no Solar Project SPA was entered into.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-9974cfc4-303f-435f-aadc-3d1526011128" data-toggle="modal" type="button">114</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> In making this argument, the plaintiff is referring to purported breaches of cl 1(c) (completion of due diligence exercise) and cl 1(d) (signing and completion of the Solar Project SPA) of the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter which would thereby trigger DWS’s right to seek a refund of the Payments under cl 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I disagree that the defendant was required to recover the Payments. As observed earlier, the conduct of the plaintiff and the evidence of Ms Tan and Mr Teh show that due diligence was conducted and nothing untoward was uncovered. There was therefore no basis for the defendant to recover the Payments. As for the failure to enter into the Solar Project SPA, the defendant may only be faulted, if at all, up to the date of his departure from the plaintiff. This was on 31 May 2019, approximately three months after the Third Payment. The plaintiff therefore has to demonstrate that DWS should have entered into the Solar Project SPA within that brief period of three months. Short of that, the defendant should have sought recovery of the Payments. However, the plaintiff has not furnished any evidence why this should have been the case. Indeed, as pointed out earlier, the plaintiff eventually decided against proceeding further with the Solar Project (although there was no indication that due diligence was unsatisfactory). In any event, it is unclear why the defendant, and not DWS, would be expected to seek a refund of the Payments given that DWS was the contracting party to the 30 November 2018 Advancement Letter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Matters that were not pleaded</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Again, I note that the plaintiff raises a host of other allegations against the defendant that were not pleaded. These mainly pertain to the defendant’s conduct concerning the 19 October 2018 LOI and the 30 October 2018 LOI. The Statement of Claim, however, centres solely on the defendant’s conduct concerning the Payments. Based on my observations earlier at [47], the plaintiff cannot rely on these allegations. In any event, these allegations are also unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff argues that the defendant did not respond to comments posed by Mr Wang Zhi, a member of the Board, after the 19 October 2018 LOI was circulated. The plaintiff avers this is because the defendant wanted to keep the Board out of the Solar Project as the Solar Project would not pass muster as a valid commercial transaction.

</div>
</div> I disagree. Had the defendant intended to keep the Board out of the Solar Project, he would not have even circulated the 19 October 2018 LOI. This is especially so given that the Group Charter did not require him to obtain Board approval at this juncture. Moreover, the plaintiff’s suggestion that the Solar Proect was not a valid commercial transaction is premised on the concerns raised by Mr Wang Zhi, which involved, among other things, the plaintiff’s lack of expertise in the solar power industry. These concerns, while legitimate, were not so damning that the validity of the Solar Project as a commercial transaction was placed in question. Without more, the plaintiff’s allegation is untenable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The plaintiff also argues that the defendant misled the Board with a press release dated 31 October 2018. The press release caused the Board to believe that due diligence would be carried out prior to the signing of a sale and purchase agreement and that no payment would be made at that time.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-5c61258d-2ed0-45f4-ac9f-4478f5e18872" data-toggle="modal" type="button">116</button></sup>

</div>
</div> This, however, differed from the contents of the 30 October 2018 LOI which had then superseded the 19 October 2018 LOI. I disagree that the press release conveyed the impression that no payment would be made. The press release was silent about whether any payments would be made and does not suggest that no<span class="font-italic"> </span>payment would be made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Based on the above, I find that the defendant was not in breach of any of his duties in respect of the Solar Project.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Before I conclude, I observe that commercial decisions made <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>by directors may (for any number of reasons) turn out to be poor loss-making ones. This aptly captures the situation at hand. In this connection, I am perturbed that the plaintiff’s only two witnesses, Ms Tan and Mr Teh (who worked on the two projects), were not able to testify with any degree of conviction that there was anything seriously wrong with the defendant’s actions at the material time. It appears to me that it is the Board which has become aggrieved with the outcomes of the two projects. It is trite that the court is slow to interfere in commercial decisions which have been made honestly even if they turn out, on hindsight, to be financially detrimental: <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) </span>[2014] 3 SLR 329 at [37].
