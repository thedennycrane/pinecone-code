<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of

Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    Malayan Banking Berhad (MBB)

    is the plaintiff in this action. Its Singapore branch had granted credit

    facilities to Measurex Engineering Pte Ltd (MEPL), the first defendant

    in the action. The facilities were secured by a guarantee dated 30 June 1997

    (the Guarantee) from the parent company of MEPL, Measurex Corporation

    Berhad (MCB) which is the second defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">

2.    MBB commenced this action to

    claim monies due and owing to it by MEPL under the facilities and by MCB

    under the Guarantee.</p><p align="justify">

3.    MBB then obtained a judgment in

    default of appearance against MCB and subsequently, MCB applied, inter alia,

    to set aside the default judgment and for the proceedings

  against it to be dismissed or stayed. The application was heard before the

  Deputy Registrar. The application to set aside the default judgment was

  successful but the application for a dismissal or a stay of proceedings was

  not successful.</p>
<p align="justify">

4.    MCB appealed against the

    dismissal of its application for proceedings to be dismissed or stayed.</p>
<p align="justify">

  5.    After hearing arguments, I

    dismissed the appeal with costs. MCB has appealed against my decision.

  </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Arguments</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">  6.    Clause 24 of the Guarantee

    states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">24. This Guarantee and all rights obligations and

  liabilities arising hereunder shall be construed and determined under and be

  enforced in accordance with the laws of Malaysia and we agree that the Courts

  of Malaysia shall have jurisdiction over all disputes arising under this

  Guarantee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

  7.    Clause 28 of the Guarantee

    states:

   </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">28. [I/We] shall at all times maintain an agent for

  services of process in Singapore. Such agent shall be [MEASUREX ENGINEERING

  PTE TD] and [I/we] undertake not to revoke the authority of the above agent

  and if for any reason such agent no longer serves as [my/our] agent to receive

  service of process in the manner provided in clause 22 hereof or such other

  manner provided by law, [I/We] shall appoint another such agent, shall (<i>sic</i>)

  advice you thereof and deliver promptly to you the acceptance by the agent of

  its appointment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

8.    It is clear that the terms of

    cl 24 of the Guarantee do not specifically state that the jurisdiction of

    the Malaysian courts is an exclusive one. Neither do they state specifically

    that it is non-exclusive. </p>
<p align="justify">

  9.    Mr Stephen Soh, acting for MCB,

    submitted that under cl 24, the determination of ones rights and

    enforcement thereof were separate. The former was to be construed by the

    governing law and the latter was to be governed by rules of procedure

    according to the lex fori but in the present case, cl 24 had already

    stipulated that enforcement was to be in accordance with the laws of

    Malaysia. According to him, therefore, the governing law and the procedural

    law was Malaysian law and this could only work if cl 24 is construed such

    that the parties had agreed that the Malaysian courts have exclusive

    jurisdiction.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  10.    Mr Soh also submitted that even

    though the word exclusive is not found in cl 24, I should nevertheless

    construe cl 24 as a provision providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of

    the Malaysian courts. He relied on <i>Continental Bank NA v Aeokos Cia

    Naviera SA &amp; others </i>[1994] 2 All ER 540 for this proposition.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  11.    The relevant provision in the <i>Continental

    Bank </i>case is cl 21 of the loan agreement. It states:

  </p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">21.01 This agreement shall be governed by and construed

  in accordance with English law. 21.02 Each of the borrowers  hereby

  irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts and hereby

  irrevocable nominates Messrs Aegis (London) Ltd of 197 Knightsbridge, London

  SW7, England, to receive service of proceedings in such courts on is behalf

  but the bank reserves the right to proceed under this agreement in the courts

  of any other country claiming or having jurisdiction in respect thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

  12.    Mr Soh pointed out that in that

    case, the bank had specifically reserved the right to proceed in the courts

    of another country, whereas in the present case, MBB had not done so.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  13.    As regards cl 28 of the

    Guarantee, Mr Soh argued that cl 28 could apply to proceedings commenced in

    Singapore against MEPL or proceedings commenced in Malaysia against MEPL but

    to be served on MEPL in Singapore.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  14.    As there was ambiguity, the two

    provisions should be construed against MBB such that cl 24 provides for the

    exclusive jurisdiction of the Malaysian courts and cl 28 only applies if

    Malaysian proceedings are commenced against MEPL but to be served on MEPL in

    Singapore.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  15.    Mr Soh accepted that even if cl

    24 were construed as an agreement to let the Malaysian courts have exclusive

    jurisdiction, MBB could still show why cl 24 should not be applied but the

    burden was on it to do so.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  16.    If, however, cl 24 were not an

    exclusive jurisdiction clause, Mr Soh accepted that the burden was on MCB to

    show why a stay should be ordered.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  17.    In that event, Mr Soh argued

    that I should nevertheless still order a stay of the action against MCB on

    the ground of forum non conveniens. On this point, he relied on <i>The

    Eleftheria</i> [1970] P.94.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  18.    The principles for a stay were

    summarised by Brandon J in <i>The Eleftheria</i> (from p 99 to 100) as

    follows:

  </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The principles established by the authorities can, I

  think, be summarised as follows: (1) Where plaintiffs sue in England in breach

  of an agreement to refer disputes to a foreign court, and the defendants apply

  for a stay, the English court, assuming the claim to be otherwise within its

  jurisdiction, is not bound to grant a stay but has a discretion whether to do

  so or not. (2) The discretion should be exercised by granting a stay unless

  strong cause for not doing so is shown. (3) The burden of proving such strong

  cause is on the plaintiffs. (4) In exercising its discretion the court should

  take into account all the circumstances of the particular case. (5) In

  particular, but without prejudice to (4), the following matters, where they

  arise, may properly be regarded: - (a) In what country the evidence on the

  issues of fact is situated, or more readily available, and the effect of that

  on the relative convenience and expense of trial as between the English and

  foreign courts. (b) Whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so,

  whether it differs from English law in any material respects. (c) With what

  country either party is connected, and how closely. (d) Whether the defendant

  genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural

  advantages. (e) Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in

  the foreign court because they would: (i) be deprived of security for their

  claim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained; (iii) be faced with a

  time-bar not applicable in England; or (iv) for political, racial, religious

  or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

  19.    Mr Soh sought to persuade me

    that there was no dispute of fact which required evidence to be given from

    witnesses in Singapore as the credit facilities and the Guarantee were not

    in dispute.

 </p>
<p align="justify">20.    He also argued that although

    the loan was made by the Singapore branch of MBB, this did not mean that

    payment had to be made in Singapore. If MCB had tendered payment in

    Malaysia, MBB would have accepted such payment. Therefore the breach by MCB

    in failing to pay could easily have taken place in Malaysia.

</p>

  21.    Mr Soh also submitted that the

    Guarantee was probably signed in Malaysia and was stamped in Malaysia.

<p align="justify">

  22.    Aside from procedural disputes

    as to whether the claim was sufficiently particularised and whether a

    judgment against MCB must be broken into various components, the main

    dispute by MCB was on the default interest claimed by MBB. Mr Soh said as

    Malaysian law governed, s 75 of the Malaysian Contracts Act of 1950 would

    apply and this section may prevent MBB from claiming default interest if

    such interest were to be construed as a penalty or if MBB failed to prove

    that its loss would amount to the equivalent of the default interest.

    Although Mr Soh accepted that the Singapore courts were capable of hearing

    Malaysian expert evidence on this section, he submitted that it was

    preferable for the Malaysian courts to do so.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  23.    Mr Soh further argued that

    there was no suggestion of injustice or detriment to MBB if a stay was

    ordered.</p>
<p align="justify">24.    His position, in summary, was

    that the connecting factors point more to Malaysia than Singapore.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  25.    Mr Herman Jeremiah, acting for

    MBB, also relied on the <i>Continental Bank </i>case. He said that it

    supported MBBs position rather than MCBs. He argued that in that case,

    the provision also stipulated that the borrower nominate someone to receive

    service of proceedings in the English courts on its behalf, just like cl 28

    of the Guarantee and the English court took this into account in concluding

    that the parties there had agreed to the jurisdiction of the English courts.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  26.    Mr Jeremiah also submitted that

    even if cl 24 provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Malaysian

    courts, I was not obliged to order a stay of the present action in Singapore

    against MCB as a Malaysian court would not have been under a similar

    obligation. He relied on <i>Inter Maritime Management Sdn Bhd v Kai Tai

    Timber Company Ltd, Hong Kong</i> <nobr>[1995] 4 CLJ 164</nobr>.</p>
<p align="justify">

  27.    Mr Jeremiah submitted that

    there were more connecting factors with Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">28.    The loan was made by a

    Singapore branch of MBB to MEPL which is a company incorporated in

    Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">

  29.    The claims against MEPL and MCB

    arose because of MEPLs failure to pay the monies due and owing by it to

    MBB.</p>
<p align="justify">30.    Payment was to be made in

    Singapore since the Singapore branch of MBB disbursed the loan, see <i>Malacca

    Securities Sdn Bhd v Loke Yu</i> <nobr>[1999] 6 MLJ 112</nobr> and <i>Bank Bumiputra

    Malaysia Berhad v Melewar Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; 4 Ors</i> <nobr>[1990] 1 CLJ 1246</nobr>.</p>
<p align="justify">31.    Action had been commenced

    against MEPL in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">32.    There is no material difference

    between Malaysian law and Singapore law on guarantees and contracts and even

    if there were such a difference, there was no reason why the Singapore

    courts would not be able to apply Malaysian law.</p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">My grounds</p>
</i></b>

  33.    I did not agree with Mr Sohs

    argument that under cl 24 of the Guarantee, both the substantive and

    procedural law of Malaysia applies. Procedural law is the law as applied by

    the lex fori, wherever the forum is.

<p align="justify">34.    The phrase  shall be

    construed and determined under and be enforced in accordance with the laws

    of Malaysia  in cl 24 of the Guarantee means that the substantive law

    applicable is Malaysian law. It does not mean Malaysian procedural law

    applies or, for that matter, that enforcement, after judgment, can only be

    effected in Malaysia.</p>
<p>35.    I also did not think that the <i>Continental

    Bank</i> case assisted MCB or MBB very much. The provision there was worded

    quite differently from cll 24 and 28 of the Guarantee.

</p><p align="justify">36.    While it is true that the

    absence of the word exclusive does not necessarily mean that a

    provision is a non-exclusive jurisdiction provision, each provision must be

    construed on its own terms and in the context of the document in which it

    appears.</p>
<p align="justify">37.    In my view, cl 24 of the

    Guarantee does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Malaysian courts and

    this is reinforced by cl 28 thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">38.    I did not agree with Mr Sohs

    argument that an alternative interpretation of cl 28 was that it allowed a

    Malaysian writ against MEPL to be served in Singapore on MEPL.</p>
<p align="justify">39.    It must be remembered that MEPL

    is not a party to the Guarantee. Therefore cl 28 cannot apply to service on

    MEPL of a Malaysian writ against MEPL. Besides, cl 28 clearly provides for

    MEPL being appointed as agent for MCB for service of process. MEPL is not

    being appointed to accept service for itself.</p>
<p align="justify">40.    I also considered whether cl 28

    can be construed to mean that if a Malaysian writ were filed against MCB,

    that writ could be effected against MCB in Singapore by service on MEPL. I

    did not think this was a tenable construction.</p>
<p align="justify">41.    If MBB were to file a Malaysian

    write against MCB, then the Malaysian writ would have been served in

    Malaysia against MCB which is, after all, a company incorporated in

    Malaysia. There is no reason for MBB to want to serve a Malaysian writ

    against a Malaysian defendant in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">42.    I also very much doubt if MBB

    would have persuaded a Malaysian court to allow it to engage in such a

manoevre.</p>
<p align="justify">43.    I concluded that Mr Sohs

    alternative interpretation of cl 28 was an attempt to avoid its clear

    meaning. It clearly envisaged proceedings by MBB against MCB in Singapore

    and hence for MCB to appoint an agent for service of process in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">44.    As for the connecting factors,

    I was of the view that the obligation by MCB to pay was to pay in Singapore

    for the reason advanced by Mr Jeremiah.</p>
<p align="justify">45.    The loan was by the Singapore

    branch of MBB to a company incorporated in Singapore and disbursed in

    Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">46.    The obligation of MCB to pay

    arose because of the default of MEPL.</p>
<p align="justify">47.    Failure to pay meant that the

    cause of action arose in Singapore. Mr Soh did not contend otherwise.

    However he argued that because MCB might have tendered payment in Malaysia

    and MBB would have accepted payment there, the breach could have occurred

    there as well.</p><p align="justify">48.    This was a disingenuous

    argument. First, MCB did not tender payment in Malaysia. If it did and MBB

    had accepted payment there, then there would have been no reason for MBB to

    commence action against MCB.</p>
<p align="justify">49.    Secondly, even if MCB had

    chosen to tender payment in Malaysia and MBB had chosen to accept such

    payment, this does not detract from the point that the legal obligation of

    MCB to pay is to pay in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">50.    The credit facilities were for

    monies in Singapore currency and the currency of the United States of

    America.</p>
<p align="justify">51.    In addition, although Mr Soh

    sought to persuade me that no evidence was required to be given from

    witnesses in Singapore, the Defence of MEPL suggested otherwise. I would say

    no more on this as I do not wish to prejudice the position of MBB or MEPL or

    MCB in the event that MBB should apply for summary judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">52.    That the Guarantee was probably

    executed in Malaysia and stamped in Malaysia and that the governing law

    thereof was Malaysian law did not outweigh the factors connected with

    Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">53.    I also did not think that a

    Singapore court would have any particular difficulty in applying s 75 of the

    Malaysian Contracts Act 1950 as it is not a particularly complex provision

    and I doubted whether it was so different from the common law concept of

    penalty.</p>
<p align="justify">54.    Indeed, in <i>Realvest

    Properties Sdn Bhd v Co-operative Central Bank Ltd (In receivership)</i>
<nobr>[1996] 2 MLJ 461</nobr>, the Federal Court (Kuala Lumpur) said, at p 470H to I:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Thus, in construing the effect of the provision of

  default interest in a contract, such specific provision would still be

  interpreted according to common law as to whether it is liquidated damages or

  a penalty, subject to and qualified by provisions of written law in the said s

  75, ie the Explanation and the illustration (d) therein which are,

  by no means from their nature, capable of supplementing in toto the common law

  on the questions of penalty and liquidated damages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">55.    In addition, if I were to order

    a stay, it would mean that there would be one action by MBB against MEPL in

    Singapore and another by MBB against MCB in Malaysia. This would not be a

    satisfactory state of affairs.

  </p>
<p align="justify">

  56.    I was also of the view that MCB

    did not genuinely desire trial in Malaysia but was engaged in delaying

    tactics.</p>
<p align="justify">

  57.    Accordingly, MCBs appeal was

    dismissed with costs.</p>
