The appeal concerns four issues: care and control of, and access to, the two children to the marriage (“Children”); maintenance of the Children; maintenance of the Wife; and the division of the matrimonial home (“the Flat”) (see <span class="font-italic">UUU v UUV </span>[2019] SGFC 37 (“GD”) at [1]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The parties were married in Singapore on 23 October 2010. The first child (“C1”) was born in March 2011, and the second child (“C2”) was born in November 2013. The parties lived in the house of the Husband’s parents from the start of their marriage until June 2013, at which point they moved to a rented flat in Ang Mo Kio. The parties stayed in the Ang Mo Kio flat until February 2015, when they moved into the Flat that they purchased. The parties lived together until the Wife moved out of the Flat with the Children on 5 May 2017. The Wife filed the Writ of Divorce on 20 July 2017, before returning to the Flat with the Children in August 2017. Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 9 January 2018, on the ground that both parties have behaved in such a way that the other party could not reasonably be expected to live with him/her. It brought to an end a marriage of about seven years. The AM hearing took place on 28 September 2018 and 13 November 2018, and the AM Order was made on 29 November 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Husband is 37 years old this year. He is a full-time safety instructor, but he also takes on part-time jobs as a private car hire driver and a bartender. The Wife is 31 years old, and she works as a personal assistant. C1 is nine years old and C2 is seven years old.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Flat, a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat in Yishun, was purchased in August 2014 in the parties’ joint names.

Once again, I am of the view that the Husband’s various commitments from 2011 to 2014 (see [18] above) meant that he would likely be less involved than the Wife in taking care of the Children for this period. For the period of 2014 onwards, the evidence did not clearly show that the Husband was more involved than the Wife in taking care of the Children. The activities raised by the Husband as evidence of this caregiving, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, attending the Children’s curricular and extracurricular activities and looking after the Children’s day to day needs, were similarly done by the Wife.

</div> The Husband’s concern was that the gross value of the Flat on the AM date would be its surrender value, since the MOP for the Flat has yet to expire then. Since the Flat’s surrender value was lower than its market value, he would thus be required to sell his share of the Flat to the Wife at a discount. This, according to the Husband, would result in a windfall to the Wife.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 To address the Husband’s arguments, I adopt a two-stage enquiry:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, should the date of valuation of the flat be the AM date or the appeal hearing date?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the AM date is adopted, should the gross valuation of the Flat be based on the surrender value?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the first question, I do not accept the Husband’s position. My attention was directed to the case of <span class="font-italic">ATT v ATS</span> [2012] 2 SLR 859 (“<span class="font-italic">ATT</span>”), which dealt with a situation similar to the present case. In <span class="font-italic">ATT</span>, the AM order entailed a “property swap” where the disputed property was given to the wife and other properties were given to the husband. After the husband filed his Notice of Appeal, the disputed property was sold as part of an <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> sale for about $1m above its valuation at the time of the AM hearing. The Court of Appeal was of the view that a change in value of an asset between the AM order and the final appeal will not, without more, be sufficient (at [25]). The Court of Appeal’s reasoning merits being set out in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…. This begged the question as to whether such a subsequent change in the value of a matrimonial asset could <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> constitute a ground for a successful appeal. … If the “property swap” order made by the Judge in this case were held to be just and equitable and had been affirmed by us, we do not see any basis to review the division on account of subsequent changes in the valuation of the asset in question. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Especially in a volatile market where prices do move up and down fairly rapidly, there should be certainty and finality. The party who, under the order on division of matrimonial assets, is given an immovable property would have to take it subject to all risks or vagaries of the market.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Otherwise, it would only encourage relitigation at the appeal stage</span>. Thus, unless there are special circumstances or compelling reasons, the mere change in value of an asset between the date of the ancillary orders and that of the hearing of the appeal per se should not be a ground to revisit the division made by the court below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my opinion, the case of <span class="font-italic">ATT </span>is not on all fours with our current case. In <span class="font-italic">ATT</span>, the <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> sale of the disputed property (and therefore the subsequent change in value) was not foreseeable at the time of the AM hearing. In our case, however, the expiry of the Flat’s MOP was foreseeable at the time of the AM hearing. Therefore, if the change in value occasioned by the expiry of the Flat’s MOP can be dealt with by the DJ during the AM hearing, the concern about encouraging relitigation would not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, I am not convinced that the change in value occasioned by the expiry of the Flat’s MOP could have been satisfactorily dealt with by the DJ. There remains the concern of speculation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, making a valuation where there is insufficient information. In our case, it would be difficult for the DJ to make an estimation on 28 September 2018 about what the market value of the Flat would be when the MOP expires eleven months later. While the Husband can wait for the MOP to expire and then file an appeal to get a more accurate valuation of the Flat (which he did in this case), such an approach will once again engage the Court of Appeal’s concern with encouraging relitigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Accordingly, I find that the appropriate date of valuation should be the AM date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On the second question, I am of the view that even if the AM date is chosen, the gross value of Flat should nevertheless be based on the market value of similar HDB properties in the vicinity, and not the Flat’s surrender value. I accept the Husband’s argument that a valuation based on the surrender value would result in a windfall to the Wife. I note that in the case of <span class="font-italic">AGD v AGF </span>[2011] SGDC 293, the District Court preferred the surrender value over the market value as the latter was “[a speculation] on what the value of the [property] might be when it is eligible for sale” (at [17]). However, in my view, the surrender value is just as much of a speculation on the Flat’s value when it is eligible for sale. The surrender value would only be an accurate estimate of the Flat’s value if it was actually surrendered to the HDB, which is unlikely to be the case. Therefore, the market value of HDB properties similar to the Flat is to be preferred to the Flat’s surrender value, the former being a more accurate indication of the real worth of the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I note that there is no evidence on the market value of HDB properties similar to the Flat on the AM date of 28 September 2018. In the circumstances, I direct the parties to obtain further evidence of such property for the purposes of deriving the gross value of the Flat, and to agree on its valuation. The valuations obtained by the parties were not based on the AM date of 28 September 2018, and thus may not be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate division ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 While only the Husband has appealed against the DJ’s orders on the division of the Flat, both parties have submitted on the DJ’s finding that the indirect contributions ratio was 30:70 between the Husband and the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I begin by addressing the arguments raised by the Wife.

I am guided by the Court of Appeal authority of <span class="font-italic">TIC v TID </span>[2019] 1 SLR 180, which stated at [24(b)] that when a spouse has been given the option of buying the other spouse’s share in a matrimonial property, the eventual owner of the property should be responsible for the mortgage payments made between the date of the AM Order and the date of completion.  Accordingly, the Wife should be responsible for the mortgage payments on the Flat for the period after the date of the AM Order, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>December 2018. The Wife should thus refund the Husband $7,326.00 (being $603.00 x 12 months from December 2018 to November 2019). As the Husband has not made mortgage payments for December 2019 and January 2020, the Wife should simply pay this amount. While there is a $3.80 late payment charge arising from the Husband’s non-payment of the mortgage loan on December 2019 and January 2020, this charge is in my view <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. It would engender less acrimony if the Wife simply pay off this minimal sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I also note that the Wife has obtained a new mortgage loan on the basis that the Flat’s surrender value would be used, and that a re-evaluation of the Flat’s value would force her to cancel this mortgage loan and suffer a loss of $4,455.00 in cancellation fees.

</div> It is unfortunate that the Wife will have to suffer this loss, but in my view there is no basis to make the Husband liable for this cancellation fee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In conclusion, para 1.3.i of the AM Order is varied such that the Husband’s weekday access during the school term would be every Monday and Friday from after school to 9.00pm. The remainder of the AM Order dealing with access on weekends, birthdays, school and public holidays is to remain. Para 2.1 of the AM Order is also varied such that the Husband is to pay the Wife a flat monthly sum of $1,000.00 monthly for maintenance of the Children. Further, para 3 of the AM Order is rescinded, so that the Husband no longer has to pay the Wife a monthly nominal maintenance of $1.00. Para 5.1 of the AM Order is likewise varied such that the Flat is divided in the ratio of 52.5:47.5 between the Wife and the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the event that parties are unable to agree on the valuation of the Flat in accordance with [58] above, they are to furnish evidence on the market value on the AM date of similar HDB properties in the vicinity of the Flat within four weeks of this judgment for the valuation to be determined by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The parties are to file and exchange their submissions on costs, limited to ten pages (excluding list of disbursements, exhibits and authorities) within four weeks of this judgment, and to inform the Registry if they are prepared to receive the order on costs by way of Registrar’s Notice.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Alyssa G Mundo (M/s Yeo &amp; Associates LLC) for the Appellant;<br/>Steffi Huang Yujia (M/s Kalco Law LLC) for the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
