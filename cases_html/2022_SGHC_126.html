The reason given was that there was no second-hand market for the Cranes and therefore the purchase price would be a fair and reasonable reflection of COE’s loss and damage suffered as a result of COD’s breach. At best, the Cranes had a certain scrap value (which was insignificant compared to the purchase price), said to be supported by some quotations for scrap steel that COE had obtained in respect of equipment other than the Cranes.

</div> COD contends that the arbitrator should not have permitted the claim to be introduced at that stage, or that he ought to have at least given COD the opportunity to put in evidence to respond to that claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 This submission depends on establishing first that the claim for damages in lieu of specific performance in the notices of arbitration and statements of claim did not fairly warn COD of the intended measure of damages and secondly that COE’s witness statement quantification did not put that measure of damages into play. Otherwise, the evidentiary hearing would have been COD’s opportunity to address it. COD responds to the fact of COE’s witness statement quantification, which specifically set out this intended measure of damages prior to the evidentiary hearing, in the following ways. COD argues that COE’s witness statement quantification was either itself insufficiently detailed, was buried beneath other material or could be safely ignored in the light of what was not pleaded. COD accordingly relies on several authorities on court pleadings in the context of damages, among them the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The English case of <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd</span> [1951] 1 All ER 873 (“<span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian</span>”), where Devlin J in deciding who had substantially succeeded in the case before him for the purpose of his considering and awarding costs, opined that where buyers claim goods sold to them are valueless by reason of some defect but wish to fall back to a claim that the goods sold are not entirely valueless they must plead that in the alternative with a method of calculation. He rejected, at 875D, the “impression that, when pleading special damage, one can plead a certain figure, arrived at in some way, and one can then set up any lower figure in court and seek to justify it”.

</div> As for the claim that the Tribunal unilaterally bifurcated proceedings, COE says the Tribunal did no such thing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 While more time was spent on arguing the natural justice challenge than the agreed arbitral procedure challenge, I will deal with the latter first. Accordingly, I frame the issues for determination as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the arbitrator proceed contrary to the arbitral procedure agreed by the parties, that is to have only one tranche of hearing without bifurcation into liability and quantum phases?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was COE’s claim for damages in lieu of specific performance based on the formula of balance contract price less scrap value introduced only after the interim award?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Did the arbitrator, in breach of natural justice, allow COE to advance that claim without giving COD a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Did the arbitrator, in breach of natural justice, fail to consider COD’s arguments disputing COE’s contention that there was no available market for the Cranes?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Did the arbitrator proceed contrary to the arbitral procedure agreed by the parties, that is to have only one tranche of hearing without bifurcation into liability and quantum phases?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  COD’s contention is essentially that the arbitrator unilaterally bifurcated the arbitration into liability and quantum phases when the parties had proceeded on the basis of a single hearing. This contention fails for one simple reason. The arbitrator did not bifurcate the hearing. There was only one evidentiary hearing and the arbitrator did not ask for or allow any <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> to be adduced after that hearing. All that the arbitrator did was to seek further <span class="font-italic">submissions</span> on the question of damages, having determined that he would not grant specific performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 So long as an arbitrator behaves in an even-handed fashion, there is generally no bar to an arbitrator asking for further submissions in the course of arbitration proceedings, including after post-hearing written or oral submissions and while deliberating prior to an award. In principle, an arbitrator is also entitled to determine those issues on which he has reached a decision in an interim award and invite further submissions on other points for a further award. This happens most often in relation to incidental matters like ancillary orders, interest and costs, but the principle is the same even for issues that fall within the core merits of a claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I would go further. Parties had agreed to an arbitral procedure where even after proceedings are declared closed (and they were not in this case until after the interim award) the tribunal is empowered on its own motion to reopen proceedings. This power extended even to further evidence and not just submissions as was sought in this case. As the arbitrator himself noted

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In fact, as I read the paragraphs of the interim award set out at [15] above, the arbitrator’s reason for inviting further submissions was for COD’s benefit. COE had provided evidence of the balance contract price and of the scrap value and there was not much by way of submission required concerning that simple formula. COD had not contested this evidence in cross-examination of COE’s witnesses, in its own witness statements or in written submissions. What the arbitrator wanted to hear more on was whether to deduct anything for the excess weight issue that was the subject of a counterclaim by COD. This is what he said explicitly:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Parties are thus hereby invited to make written submissions on the appropriate quantum of damages to be awarded to [COE] to take into account any plausible impact to the vessel arising from the excess weight of the cranes such as, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, fuel consumption rate, cargo carrying capacity or modifications to vessel construction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  Thus, the arbitrator was not giving COE an opportunity to have a second bite of the cherry or otherwise to remedy any deficiency in its case on damages by adducing further evidence, as COD contends. Rather, he was in fact offering COD the opportunity to put forward a case that there should be a deduction for the excess weight of the Cranes when assessing damages and to explain how much such deduction should be. He chose to give COD this opportunity instead of assuming that no such deduction should be made given that COD had not raised this point prior to the interim award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Ultimately, having given COD this further opportunity, the arbitrator did not make any such deduction. But it lies ill in the mouth of COD to complain about the arbitrator’s having given it this opportunity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any case, COD’s principal concern with the arbitrator’s decision to issue an interim award is that it gave COE the opportunity to advance a new claim for damages. As will be seen in the next section, I find that this is not correct. Before I turn to that, I would observe that COD’s criticisms could be said to be directed to the interim award when instead of proceeding to a decision on all issues the arbitrator invited further submissions on the question of damages in lieu of specific performance. No challenge to the interim award was ever filed, and parties are bound by it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Was COE’s claim for damages in lieu of specific performance based on the formula of balance contract price less scrap value introduced only after the interim award?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the following reasons, I do not find that the claim for damages in lieu of specific performance based on the formula of balance contract price less scrap value was first introduced on 28 August 2020 in COE’s submissions on costs and damages after the interim award. It was introduced before the evidentiary hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First, the formula is perfectly clear in COE’s witness statement quantification.

</div>
</div>) and asserting that counsel in the arbitration was entitled to disregard it because the formula was not set out in the notices of arbitration or statements of claim. Neither of these points have merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I do not consider that the formula was buried. It is not surprising that COE’s effort was mainly focused on its effort to obtain specific performance and that this took up the bulk of its evidence. But a claim for damages in lieu of specific performance had been pleaded, and it would only be reasonable for COD’s counsel to read COE’s witness statements in full and address those parts, however relatively short they might be, that concerned COE’s alternative claim in damages. What matters is that COE’s witness statement quantification was unambiguous. It would have been clear to anyone who had read COE’s witness statement quantification that COE was relying on the formula of balance contract price less scrap value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Nor do I consider that COD’s counsel was entitled to disregard COE’s witness statement quantification just because the formula had not been spelled out in the notices of arbitration or the statements of claim. Such a position could only begin to be justified if parties had adopted formal pleading rules that required the measure of damages for general damages claims to be spelled out in the pleadings. COD relies on Rule 17.2(c) of the SIAC Rules, which requires parties to set out in “full detail” the “relief claimed together with the amount of all quantifiable claims” in the statement of claim. However, this simply reflects the usual position that special damages must be specifically pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Moreover, even in court proceedings, it may happen that new or more detailed or alternative methods for calculating damages may be introduced otherwise than by formal amendment of pleadings, and the question is whether the other party had sufficient notice and opportunity to deal with it. In <span class="font-italic">The Shravan</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the plaintiff’s claim for loss of revenue was pleaded, but the method of calculating this loss on which the plaintiff ultimately relied was not. However, the plaintiff did state that it would seek damages calculated using the alternative method in its opening statement. Leave was granted to the defendants to adduce evidence in response to this alternative method, but the defendants chose not to do so. At [79], Chao J (as he then was) held that “there [could have been] no doubt that the defendants had more than ample time to prepare their case on the alternative basis of computing loss of revenue” and that “[i]f it were necessary that this alternative basis for determining loss should be explicitly pleaded and if the loss had been proven, [he] would grant the necessary leave to amend.” Similarly, while COE may not have specifically pleaded its method for calculating damages for non-acceptance of the Cranes, it was sufficiently set out prior to the commencement of the evidentiary hearing in COE’s witness statement. As noted at [35] above, no leave was sought by COD to adduce evidence to respond to COE’s witness statement quantification. That, however, does not change the fact that they had ample time to prepare their case in response to COE’s witness statement quantification. Thus, the absence of the formula of contract price less scrap value from the notices of arbitration or statements of claim did not entitle COD to ignore COE’s witness statement quantification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, I would in fact agree with the arbitrator that even from the plea in the statements of claim on their own, COD “would have been aware of the need to address the various issues relating to a claim for damages”.

</div> The statements of claim refer to “damages for the said breach of Contract, including…” (see [8] above). This is clearly a claim for general damages, not limited to the specific items listed in that paragraph. The obvious way of compensating for the loss that flows naturally and reasonably from a buyer’s refusal to accept goods is to use the formula of contract price less value of those goods. As for how that value was to be determined, COE’s contention that the Cranes were unique, that it had no use for them and that it would be difficult to find an alternative buyer was already part of its pleaded case for specific performance. Logically, if equipment has no resale value, then one falls back to scrap value. This approach, which I consider should have been obvious to experienced counsel in the context of a case involving allegedly unique goods, was in any event expressed clearly in COE’s witness statement quantification. Thus, this is a case where the factual basis or building blocks for the decision including the uniqueness of the Cranes and the difficulty of finding an alternative buyer were fully in play throughout the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 COD submits that it is not necessarily the case that if there is no market for goods, their value is their scrap value.

</div>
</div> Thus, COE’s submission that there was no market for the Cranes in the context of seeking specific performance was not sufficient to give COD fair notice that their case was that the value of the Cranes was scrap value. However, while this proposition of law may be true, it is beside the point. First, whether COE adduced sufficient evidence (as opposed to any evidence at all) to justify the arbitrator’s finding that the value of the Cranes was scrap value is irrelevant. That goes to the merits of the final award. Second, even if it was not clear from the statements of claim how COE proposed to value the Cranes, it was clear that the value of the Cranes was a live issue. As I have said at [52] above, the obvious and natural loss flowing from non-acceptance of goods is the contract price minus the value of the goods. It is not the case that COD adduced evidence or made submissions addressed to a different valuation of the Cranes because it misapprehended COE’s case in the statements of claim. COD simply chose not to address the issue of valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further, once COE’s witness statement quantification was filed, COD had ample opportunity to consider whether it wanted to challenge the assertion that COE was not able to find buyers for the Cranes or to contend for a higher scrap value. COD did not seek leave to supplement its witness statements whether orally or in writing, nor did COD seek to put in any further evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The other two authorities that COD relies on concerning pleadings do not assist its case, even if one were to import formal pleading rules into arbitration. In <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian</span>, the plaintiffs’ original statement of claim set out in effect that the goods were of no value at all and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the whole of their purchase price on the basis that they were valueless (at 875). Devlin J held that this pleading did not encompass the claim that the plaintiffs eventually succeeded on, which was that the goods were commercially sound except for a defect that could easily have been removed, which entitled them to receive the cost of removing the defect as damages. Thus, the amendment to the statement of claim that he had granted earlier in the proceedings had been a necessary amendment. The issues with which the court was concerned are plainly different from the present case. COE did not set out in its statements of claim a valuation for the Cranes which was different from that which it ultimately relied on. Rather, they did not specify any valuation for the Cranes in the statements of claim, but did so in COE’s witness statement quantification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The remarks from <span class="font-italic">Perestrello </span>which<span class="font-italic"> </span>COD relies on were made in the context of a claim for loss of profits being advanced when the only pleaded relief was compensation for wasted expenditure. The court held that a general claim for “damages” in the statement of claim would not allow the plaintiff to advance a claim for loss of profits for two reasons. First, loss of profits was not a necessary consequence of the defendant’s wrongful act. Second, the claim for loss of profits was inconsistent with the pleaded claim for wasted expenditure. Neither reason applies to this case. Here, loss amounting to contract price minus the value of goods is a necessary, and certainly obvious, consequence of non-acceptance of goods (see [52] above). Also, a claim for such damages is not inconsistent with COE’s specific performance claim because it was sought in the alternative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I find that COD did indeed adopt the litigation strategy of focusing on its substantive defence of non-compliance with specifications as justifying its termination of the contracts. Success in that strategy would have meant that COE’s claims both primary and alternative would have been dismissed. This meant that COD decided not to focus very much on the quantum of damages COE should obtain if COD failed to justify its termination and COE failed to obtain specific performance. COD may have been surprised that it lost on the question of termination, but that does not mean that it should have been surprised that, if it did lose, the arbitrator would turn to the question of damages for COE based on COE’s witness statement quantification.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Did the arbitrator, in breach of natural justice, allow COE to advance this claim without giving COD a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Because of my finding at [47] above, this issue is readily answered in the negative. Given that COE’s claimed measure of damages as balance contract price less scrap value was introduced prior to the evidentiary hearing, there can be no question that COD was given a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 For this reason, the authorities that COD cites which involve claims introduced on the final day of the arbitral hearing (see <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> at [69]) or in written closing submissions (see <span class="font-italic">CAJ and another v CAI and another appeal</span> [2022] 1 SLR 505 at [8]) are of no assistance to it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Did the arbitrator, in breach of natural justice, fail to consider COD’s arguments disputing COE’s contention that there was no available market for the Cranes? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 COD also contends that the arbitrator failed to consider its arguments concerning the availability of a market for the Cranes. COD’s arguments were essentially that if the Cranes had complied with the specifications, then they would have found a ready market, either being delivered to COD or to a third party who would have taken advantage of the new technology.

The question of whether there was no available market for the Cranes was something COE put in issue in relation to its primary claim for specific performance.

</div> I do not see this to be the case. It is hardly the inescapable inference from the paragraph of the final award cited above that the arbitrator dispensed with the need for COE to prove its case because he assumed that COD accepted COE’s case. My reading of his final award, taken as a whole, is that he concluded from the evidence before him, which was the uncontroverted evidence of COE’s consultant, that COE had proven there was no available market for the Cranes on a balance of probabilities. COD may not agree with this conclusion, but it was a conclusion that the arbitrator was entitled to reach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Indeed, I come back to the point that the arbitrator had in the interim award invited submissions focused on the question of whether there should be a deduction made for excess weight from any damages to be awarded. A fair reading of the interim award reveals that he was with COE on the point that the Cranes were unique and of no use to COE and that there were no other buyers, but declined to grant specific performance only because of COE’s non-compliance with specifications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I end with five observations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Awards are not meant to be read microscopically, but generously, as advised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmont Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at [65(f)] (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>”). In my view, this entails reading the award as a whole, seeking to make coherent sense of it. Some of COD’s submissions have not reflected the arbitrator’s actual reasoning as expressed in the interim and final awards.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Moreover, while “an arbitrator [is not] under any general obligation to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he finally commits himself” (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>, at [55(h)]), he is generally entitled to invite further submissions from counsel, as he did here, before making a final decision on an issue, and while so doing may decide other issues while reserving his decision concerning that issue for a further award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As emphasised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> at [39], the court must “resist the temptation to engage with what is substantially an appeal on the legal merits of an arbitral award, but which, through the ingenuity of counsel, may be disguised and presented as a challenge to process failures during the arbitration”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Formal court pleading rules are not necessarily applicable to arbitrations, even ones under the AA, except to the extent that parties expressly or impliedly adopt them by virtue of their agreement on arbitral procedure. The question for the court is ultimately one of fact: did the party challenging the award for breach of natural justice have sufficient notice of the case it had to meet? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ultimately, the cause of doing justice depends on the adjudicator having the flexibility to adapt procedure to the needs of the case, while bearing in mind the requirements of natural justice. It would be both ironic and wrong if arbitration, intended originally to have the advantages of relative informality and flexibility, were to become a minefield of procedural obstacles, necessitating arbitrators to armour up and adopt formulaic defensive practices at the expense of doing justice reasonably and efficiently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I dismiss COD’s application to set aside in its entirety.
