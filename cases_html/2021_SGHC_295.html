While the accused and V were in Room 301, the accused identified himself to V as a police officer. In fact, V was not – and had never been – a police officer. While they were in Room 301, the accused used his phone to do a voice recording of the conversation between him and V.

Instead, he told her to switch off the light or he would hurt her. When V looked up, she “saw [the accused] showing [V] a knife”. According to V, he did not actually point the knife at her. The knife was a Swiss Army knife, “red colour”, and “has many tools”. As she was fearful of the knife, V quickly switched off the lights and removed her clothes as instructed by the accused. The accused then climbed on top of her and tried to kiss her. After a while, he moved to the side of the bed, guided her head towards his penis and asked her to perform a “blow job” for him, which she did. As she was doing so, she “tasted some form of discharge in [her] mouth” and “[knew] it was not semen but some form of infection”.

V tried to get him off her by making excuses like “I have a condom”, but he proceeded anyway to penetrate her vagina with his penis. Following this instance of penile-vaginal intercourse, the accused asked V to do a “hand job” for him. She “was not willing” but “just briefly did [it]”. He also instructed her to do another “blowjob for him” and again “guided [her] head to his penis”. After she had complied with his instructions, the accused asked V to lie on his shoulder while he masturbated himself. He asked V if he could ejaculate in her mouth and she refused. He then asked if he could ejaculate on her chest, to which she agreed.

I should also add that there was no evidence at all to suggest she had any motive to make up lies against the accused – and indeed, even the accused himself was unable to come up with any motive for her to incriminate him falsely.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) V’s account of the offences was corroborated by other evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 At the same time, as the High Court has cautioned in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr </span>[2019] 3 SLR 749 (“<span class="font-italic">Yue Roger Jr</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”), the fact that there was no evidence of any motive or reason for the victim to mount fabrications against the accused is not sufficient on its own to render the victim’s testimony unusually convincing and correspondingly sufficient to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt (at [50]). As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Yue Roger </span><span class="font-italic">Jr (HC)</span> also noted, the word “unusually” in the unusually convincing standard implies that it is not sufficient for the victim’s testimony to be merely convincing, and there must be something more in the testimony to bring it over the threshold (at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the present case, as I have explained, I found that V maintained her account of events throughout cross-examination, and that her evidence was on the whole believable – indeed, convincing. However, bearing in mind the “unusually convincing” standard which had to be met, and given the differing accounts in V’s first and third statements of the number and sequence of sexual acts as well as the delayed reporting of the second act of non-consensual penile-vaginal intercourse (which I return to at [117] to [134] below), I did not think it safe to proceed on the basis that V’s evidence was unusually convincing and sufficient <span class="font-italic">on its own</span> to convict the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 This was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case, however, as I was satisfied that there was other evidence in this which corroborated V’s account of the offences. First, it must be pointed out that V consistently denied the accused’s claims of a consensual (even pleasant) sexual encounter: she consistently told numerous third parties that she had been raped and that just prior to the rape, the accused had shown her a Swiss Army knife. These third parties included B, who was the first person to see her soon after she managed to get home, as well as the various police officers who spoke to her after responding to her call to the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In this connection, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the account of the rape and sexual assault related by V to B <span class="font-italic">was</span> materially consistent with her testimony at trial. In gist, she told B that the accused had used a knife in order to threaten and subsequently to sexually assault her.

At that time, the man was pointing a knife at her back. The receptionist ignored her during the check in.

It should further be noted that when Senior Staff Sergeant Faridah binte Abu Bakar (“SSSgt Faridah”) interviewed V shortly after the police were called and after B left the room, V was forthright in immediately admitting to SSSgt Faridah that she had lied to B because she did not want him to know she was working as a social escort.

After that, he told victim to change to another room. Victim then proceed to change room and was given room 305.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While at the room, defendant told victim to offer him sex so that he would not bring her back to police station. Victim asked defendant for his pass to confirm his identity, but he took out a Swiss army knife (not pointing at her) and told her to switch off the light or else he would hurt her. Out of fear, victim complied. The defendant put away the knife, climbed on top of her and kissed her. Victim tried to break free but he was too big size. Subject then told the victim to do blow job on him. After that, subject wanted to penetrate her, and the victim kept moving backwards to refuse him. However the subject kept advancing, and eventually managed to penetrate into her. Subject did not wear any condom. After that, the subject ejaculated onto her front body and she went to bath.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">After finished, defendant became apologetic and wanted to make friend with the victim, gave her his contact number [redacted], and sent her back home by taxi. Subject also told her that he would pay her house rental and wanted to move in stay with her. He told her that he would go to her house on 23 Feb at 4pm. Upon reaching home, victim told her friend about this matter, and he advised her to report to the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the Prosecution pointed out in their closing submissions, the account given by V to SSSgt Faridah and SI Ho and documented in the Police Message Form contained “the crucial facts” pertaining to the rape and sexual assault: namely, that the accused had impersonated a police officer, that he had shown V a Swiss Army knife with the blade revealed, and that he had told her he would have to harm her if she did not switch off the lights as instructed.

When V asked him for payment, he did not want to pay her the $50 rejection fee, so he decided to impersonate a police officer and to use his mobile phone to record their conversation. After he stopped the recording, he was about to leave the room, but V started crying and so he comforted her. He asked her how long she had booked the room for, and she said she had booked it for two hours as she had another client at 9.15pm. The accused said he wanted to change rooms so that V’s next client would not be able to find her, and so he went with her to change rooms.

</div> It beggared belief, therefore, that while the accused was facing a potential rape charge, he should simultaneously have been so fearful about the far less serious impersonation charge that he resorted to telling lies to the police. Further, even assuming he had lied in his first statement and again in his second statement out of a timorous desire to “cover up” the impersonation charge, it made no sense for him to lie about paying V $450 for sex. This lie about paying V $450 for sex had nothing at all to do with the impersonation charge – and everything to do with the rape charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Second, although in his fourth statement the accused claimed that his conversation with V about the $40 only occurred <span class="font-italic">after </span>they had completed sexual intercourse, his position as stated in the Case for the Defence and at trial was that <span class="font-italic">before </span>sexual intercourse occurred, he had already come to an agreement with V to pay her $40.

</div> and since his position was that the account given at trial represented the truth, this meant he must have lied in his fourth statement about when he agreed to pay V $40 for sex. Yet there appeared to be no sensible reason why he should have lied about this issue. Certainly, it could not have been a lie told to “cover up” for the impersonation charge, since he had already confessed to the impersonation charge in his third statement. Nor could it have been a simple error on his part, because he was very clear in his testimony at trial that V had stipulated two conditions for having sex with him: that he agree to paying her $40 and that he allow her to send a text message to her friends. It appeared to me that the idea of framing the $40 as pre-agreed payment to V for sex only came to the accused when he had to put on record his position in the Case for the Defence – and he then sought to embellish this narrative by adding at trial the second condition that he allow V to text her friends.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Third, the accused claimed to have been labouring under the misapprehension that if he told the police he had paid V $40 for consensual sex instead of $450, he would expose himself to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the rape charge <span class="font-italic">and </span>potential “additional charges”.

</div> As with his various other claims, this one made no sense at all.

</div> Even more confoundingly, when pressed further on this issue, the accused appeared to abandon his story about having believed that failure to pay $450 for sex would amount to rape: instead, according to him, while he had not offered V payment for sex, he had nevertheless “mentioned…the rental issue to her earlier” and this was “<span class="font-italic">something like payment</span>” [emphasis added].

The accused himself admitted that he never brought this up to the police officers conducting his interviews.

His explanation was that he had wanted to ask but was not given a chance.

As it was not disputed that sexual intercourse had taken place, it would have been entirely unnecessary and counter-intuitive for V falsely – and belatedly – to conjure up a further count of sexual intercourse that had never happened.

In the present case, while there was indisputably a fairly lengthy delay by V in reporting the second act of penile-vaginal penetration, V was able to provide an explanation for the delay. V testified that the memory of the second act of non-consensual penile-vagina intercourse had come as “a flashback” upon her hearing a colleague utter the same words that the accused had spoken during the second act of penile-vaginal intercourse, when he asked why she looked like she was “not enjoying it”.

It was clear that following the incident of 21 February 2019, V had sought stoically to move on with her life. She did not initially go for counselling and had rejected the IO’s offer to link her up with social workers, despite the events of 21 February 2019 having apparently left the marks of trauma on her: <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, she described herself as having been in “very like depressive state” following the rape and sexual assault; and she recounted how she had suffered from “bad dreams at night” and how her mother had commented on her weight loss and inability to eat at a family gathering shortly after the incident.

</div> I found it unsurprising and entirely believable that in her traumatised state, the complete memory of the harrowing events of 21 February 2019 should have been jolted only months later by her hearing the words spoken by the accused during the second act of penile-vaginal penetration uttered aloud again by a colleague (albeit in a different context). I also agreed with the Prosecution that there was simply no reason for V to make up a story about a second act of penile-vaginal penetration months after her initial police report. Indeed, if her police report was false (as the accused claimed), she had every reason not to trigger suspicion from the police by appearing to change her evidence months later.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 While I accepted V’s explanation and I did not find that the delayed reported detracted from her overall credibility, this delay was one factor which led me to conclude it was not safe to proceed on the basis that V’s evidence was not just “convincing” but “unusually convincing” (at [62]). However, as I also said earlier (at [64], this was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case because I found that there was other evidence which corroborated V’s account of the offences. I have alluded to the various pieces of evidence which corroborated V’s account of the rape and sexual assault (see [65] to [72] above). I examine in greater detail below the evidence which corroborated V’s account of the second instance of penile-vaginal intercourse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In this case, corroboration was provided by the accused’s own evidence in his fourth statement of 25 February 2019. In this fourth statement, in providing details of the alleged sexual encounter with V, the accused clearly described two acts of penile-vaginal intercourse, as well as two acts of penile-oral intercourse. He also clearly described himself as having been on top of V during the first act of penile-vaginal intercourse and V as having been on top of him during the second act of penile-vaginal intercourse:

</div> As noted earlier, SSSgt Faridah had recorded in the Police Message Form that there was one incident of “fellatio” followed by “sexual intercourse” (at [68]). In his Investigation Diary, SI Ong had recorded that there was one instance of penile-oral penetration followed by penile-vaginal penetration (at [69]). The Defence claimed that these notes showed that V had given evidence to the police which was inconsistent with her testimony. I disagreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 First, it should be noted that the contents of the Police Message Form and SI Ong’s Investigation Diary were never read back to V: she was never asked to verify the accuracy of what SSSgt Faridah and SI Ong had recorded. Second, SSSgt Faridah’s and SI Ong’s records of what they recalled V telling them were not meant to be a comprehensive account of the incident at the Hotel. As SI Ong explained, he did not “go much detail” on issues like whether the accused had been on top of V or whether V had been on top of him because “at that point of time, this is not a division case”: his role was only to “establish that this is a rape case” and let the matter be handled by the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch. As such, his notes were “in just a brief form, instead of a very detailed form”.

On the whole, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no real inconsistency in V’s evidence, and that it was really a matter of semantics which the Defence had latched on to. I would add that V’s evidence actually reinforced my impression of her as an honest and conscientious witness. Had she indeed been trying to falsely implicate the accused, one would have expected her to insist from the outset that the accused was pointing his knife directly at her. That she took pains to explain why she felt it would be unfair to describe the accused as having pointed the knife at her showed that she was not willing to embellish or exaggerate her evidence for the sake of incriminating the accused.

Second, as the Prosecution pointed out, if she had appeared to be “looking out” for the knife, it might have signalled to the accused that she was thinking of wrestling possession of it, and this might have put her in even more danger from the accused.

The Defence picked out several aspects of V’s behaviour as being illogical, implausible or strange. According to the Defence, V’s act of wiggling her body backwards and saying “no” when the accused was on top of her was not consistent with someone who was fearful of being hurt by a knife. In respect of V’s evidence that she had also told the accused she had a condom in her bag because she wanted to flee from the room when he went to retrieve the condom, the Defence argued that this evidence could not be believed: according to the Defence, if she had genuinely been afraid of being hurt by the knife, she would surely not have tried to escape even if the accused got off her to retrieve the condom. Other areas of V’s evidence which the Defence found fault with included her evidence that she had hesitated when first told by the accused to give him a “blowjob” and that she had refused his request to ejaculate in her mouth. According to the Defence, if she had genuinely been afraid of being hurt by the knife, she would surely not have hesitated in complying with the accused’s instructions that she give him a “blowjob”, and she would surely also not have dared to refuse to let him ejaculate in her mouth.

I reiterate what I said at [160] earlier about different people reacting in different ways to sexual abuse. In addition, V was able to provide cogent explanations for her reactions. First, while she had considered running out of Room 305 while putting on her clothes, she did not in fact do so because quite apart from having been effectively half-naked, she had also realised she still needed to get her NRIC and mobile phone back from the accused. Moreover, she had not seen any stairs near Room 305 and did not know if she could get out of the Hotel in time.

He was also well aware that V had met him while hiring out her sexual services as a social escort.

Our courts have always said that rape is generally regarded as “the most grave of all the sexual offences” (<span class="font-italic">Chia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 (“<span class="font-italic">Frederick Chia</span>”) at [9]). In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BMD</span> [2013] SGHC 235, cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [152], where the accused was convicted of multiple sexual offences including rape and various instances of sexual assault by penetration, the High Court held that the rape charges warranted the heaviest punishments, as penile-vaginal penetration was considered “the most heinous among the four categories of offences listed in the six charges”. This was followed by penile-oral penetration (fellatio), penile-anal penetration and finally digital-anal penetration, with the court noting the high degree of revulsion and disgust associated with offences involving forced fellatio (at [73]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 It was also not disputed that the relevant sentencing frameworks for rape offences and offences of sexual assault by penetration were set out in <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>respectively, and that the present case fell within Band 2 of each of the frameworks. However, the Prosecution and Defence differed on where along the range in Band 2 of each framework the present case should fall.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Having considered the evidence and parties’ submissions, I was of the view that this case fell around the mid-point of Band 2 of both the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>frameworks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 For stage 1 of each framework, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the offence-specific factors, I found that the following offence-specific factors were present. First, the accused had used a knife to put V in fear of hurt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Second, there was clearly premeditation on his part: as the Prosecution pointed out, the accused had booked V’s sexual services, knowing full well that he had no money to pay for these services, and clearly intent nonetheless on getting sex from her one way or another. As I noted earlier, although the accused claimed that he had been hoping for a social escort who would only collect payment after sex (so that he could run away immediately after having sex), he also knew that there was a “high chance” that V would collect payment before sex.

</div>
</div>
</div> Accordingly, the accused must already have had a plan in mind for obtaining sex without payment – other than running away – when he went to the Hotel to meet V. This was borne out by his subsequent behaviour. When V sought payment of her usual fee right at the outset prior to any sexual activity, the accused did not inform her he had no money to pay her fee, nor did he flee from the room. Instead, he first pretended to be a police officer on an anti-vice operation and tried to get V to offer him sex in exchange for her “freedom”. When this ruse failed to achieve the intended effect, he still did not run away. Instead, he seamlessly escalated his behaviour by showing her the Swiss Army knife and threatening to harm her with the knife if she did not comply with his instructions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Third, I agreed with the Prosecution that V was a vulnerable victim by reason of her occupation as a social escort. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449 (at [84]), VK Rajah JA rejected as being “preposterous” the notion that offences against sex workers “should not be viewed as seriously” and noted that the courts would “often consider such persons to be vulnerable victims, given their reluctance to come forward when offences are committed against them”. In the present case, I have alluded earlier (at [20]) to V’s evidence about her agent A having advised her against making a police report about the rape, precisely because of her occupation as a social escort. Further, as the Prosecution has highlighted, the accused’s own conduct demonstrated that he was conscious of the exposed position which V found herself in by virtue of her line of work and was willing to exploit it to his advantage – as seen, for example, in his taking possession of her mobile phone and NRIC while pretending to be a police officer on an anti-vice operation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As our courts have observed on many occasions, offences against vulnerable victims “often create deep judicial disquiet”; and general deterrence “must necessarily constitute an important consideration in the sentencing of perpetrators” who target vulnerable victims: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [24(b)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Fourth, the accused did not use a condom for the acts of penile-vaginal intercourse, which meant that V was put at risk of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Fifth, the Prosecution also highlighted the commission of other acts by the accused in the course of committing the rapes and sexual assault by penetration, which could technically constitute separate offences and should be considered in sentencing. I refer to the accused’s conduct in making V masturbate him by hand and in ejaculating on her chest. It should also be noted that the sense of intrusion and violation suffered by V was heightened by the accused’s conduct post-assault in first taking a photo of her NRIC, then obtaining her mobile number, telling her he proposed to move into her flat, and finally, following her all the way back to her front door – and continuing to text her even after they had parted ways. All of this would have underscored to V the chilling fact that her rapist knew exactly where she lived and how to find her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In the light of the above offence-specific factors, I put the present case around the mid-point of Band 2 of both the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> and the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> frameworks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Moving to stage 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework and the <span class="font-italic">Pram</span><span class="font-italic"> Nair</span> framework in respect of the offender-specific factors, I could not see any mitigating factors in this case. Since the accused chose to claim trial and V had to relive the horror of the sexual assaults in court, the accused was not entitled to the sentencing discount normally given to accused persons who plead guilty. The accused was also traced for the offence of criminal intimidation which was an offence of some relevance to the sentencing considerations in this case, given his use of a knife to put V in fear of hurt to herself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 In respect of the charge taken into consideration under s 170 of the Penal Code, I had already considered the facts pertaining to this charge in addressing the offence-specific factors under Stage 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> and the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> frameworks. As such, I did not add any uplift on account of this charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 For the reasons outlined above, I concluded that the appropriate sentence for each charge of aggravated rape should be 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, while the appropriate sentence for each charge of aggravated sexual assault by penetration should be 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 In considering the aggregate sentence to be imposed, I bore in mind the principle set out in the relevant authorities, including <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>, Menon CJ held that the two limbs of the totality principle required the sentencing court to consider, first, whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, and second, whether its effect is to impose on the offender a crushing sentence, not in keeping with his record and prospects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Importantly, it should also be remembered that although the totality principle “has generally been taken to possess a limiting function, in the sense that it operates to prevent a court from imposing an excessive overall sentence”, it is “as a matter of logic… equally capable of having a boosting effect on individual sentences where they would otherwise result in a manifestly inadequate overall sentence” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 4 SLR 838 (“<span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne</span>”) at [20]). As Menon CJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne</span>, the totality principle requires not only that the overall sentence not be excessive but also that it not be inadequate: in the ultimate analysis, “the court has to assess the totality of the aggregate sentence with the totality of the criminal behaviour” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ADF v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 874 at [146]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that a relevant factor to be borne in mind in considering the appropriate aggregate sentence was the fact that the accused had committed four discrete acts of non-consensual sexual penetration against V (albeit within a relatively short span of time).

</div> I agreed with the Prosecution that the aggregate sentence in such a case should be higher than the sentence in a case involving only one act of non-consensual sexual penetration, in order to reflect the fact that an accused who subjects his victim to multiple acts of non-consensual sexual penetration inflicts even greater harm than that inflicted in the case of a single act of penetration.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 In considering the appropriate aggregate sentence to be imposed in this case, I also reviewed the cases cited to me by both sides as sentencing precedents. I should make it clear that in reviewing the cases cited, I considered that unreported decisions – such as the case of <span class="font-italic">Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor v Paramjit Singh s/o Minder Singh </span>(CC 30/2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Paramjit</span>”) on which the Defence placed substantial reliance

</div> It was not possible for me to conclude, based on an examination of these few documents, that <span class="font-italic">Paramjit </span>should be treated as a “comparable precedent” or that the facts of <span class="font-italic">Paramjit</span> were “far more egregious than the present case”. First, it should be noted that the accused in <span class="font-italic">Paramjit</span> pleaded guilty to the charge of aggravated rape and the two charges of aggravated sexual assault by penetration. All other things being equal, such a plea of guilt would have been a mitigating factor for the purposes of sentencing. In contrast, the accused in this case put his victim through the ordeal of a trial and was thus not entitled to the discount in sentence normally afforded to those accused who plead guilty. Second, the accused in <span class="font-italic">Paramjit </span>was convicted of three charges (one charge of aggravated rape and two charges of aggravated sexual assault by penetration), whereas the present accused has been convicted of a total of four charges (<span class="font-italic">two </span>charges of aggravated rape and two charges of aggravated sexual assault by penetration). Third, while there appear to have been some aggravating factors present in <span class="font-italic">Paramjit </span>which<span class="font-italic"> </span>were not present in this case (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>the accused in <span class="font-italic">Paramjit </span>had pointed his knife at the victim’s throat and hit her head with his hand), there were aggravating factors present in this case which did not feature in <span class="font-italic">Paramjit</span>: <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in this case it was clear from the evidence that the accused’s offences were premeditated, whereas from the statement of facts in <span class="font-italic">Paramjit</span>, it appeared that the accused in that case had formed the intention of committing sexual offences against the victim on the spur of the moment when he spotted her walking along the corridor of the building where he had gone to “<span class="font-italic">relax</span>”.

</div>
</div> were of limited direct relevance, since these cases did not even feature offences of <span class="font-italic">aggravated </span>rape and/or <span class="font-italic">aggravated</span> sexual assault by penetration. In <span class="font-italic">Sivakumar</span>, for example, the accused was convicted after trial of one charge of outrage of modesty, one charge of rape and one charge of sexual assault by penetration (and convicted additionally on appeal of a charge of impersonation of a public officer); and from the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Sivakumar</span>, it is clear that the court based its decision on the “benchmark sentence of ten years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane” set in <span class="font-italic">Frederick Chia</span> “for a rape without aggravating or mitigating factors and where the offender claimed trial” (<span class="font-italic">Sivakumar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69] and [71]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I noted, on the other hand, that although the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Robiul Bhoreshuddin Mondal</span> [2010] SGHC 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Robiul</span>”) predated <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, it was cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>(at [54(a)]) as an example of a case which might fall within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>sentencing framework. In <span class="font-italic">Robiul</span>, the accused broke into a house late at night and raped the victim, a domestic helper employed to work in that household. The accused was familiar with the premises because he had previously done gardening work for a neighbouring household, and had waited for an opportune moment to break in. He raped the victim four times in the course of the night. He threatened to kill the victim with a knife if she tried to shout (although the victim did not actually see any knife). He was convicted after trial of seven charges, namely: one charge under section 457 of the Penal Code, one charge under section 354A(1), four charges under section 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and one charge under section 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). The four charges under section 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) involved the accused raping the victim by penetrating her vagina with his penis without her consent, and putting her in fear of death in order to commit the rapes (by telling her he would kill her with a knife if she shouted). The charge under section 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) involved the accused penetrating the victim’s vagina with his finger without her consent, and similarly putting her in fear of death in order to commit the offence. In sentencing the accused to an aggregate sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, the High Court noted that the accused had been “opportunistic” in thinking he could force himself on the victim and then buy his way out by offering her money and gifts. He had also committed housebreaking in order to violate the victim, and had “raped her in the sanctity of her locked room and on the bed on which she rested every night and which she had to continue to use after” the violent assaults (at [128]). The court also accepted that the victim was a virgin prior to the rapes, which “added to her physical and psychological pain” (at [129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 <span class="font-italic">Robiul </span>appeared to me to be a comparable precedent. I did not agree with the Prosecution that the facts of the present case were “more aggravated” than the facts in <span class="font-italic">Robiul</span>. While the accused in <span class="font-italic">Robiul</span> did not actually show the victim a knife, he had threatened to <span class="font-italic">kill </span>her with one if she tried to shout; and the victim in that case was so terrified that she even closed her eyes at one point as she was “afraid to look” (at [19]). The victim in <span class="font-italic">Robiul</span> was a virgin prior to the rape; and during the trial, she was subjected to the humiliation of being portrayed as a “loose woman” by the accused (at [126]). In addition, the accused “ha[d] shown during the trial that he would not hesitate to tar and mar the reputation of police officers and the interpreter by accusing them of lying and/or of incompetence” (at [130]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 Having considered the relevant sentencing principles and having also reviewed the cases cited by both sides, I concluded that in this case, an aggregate sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was appropriate. I arrived at this aggregate sentence by adjusting the sentence of imprisonment for each of the charges of aggravated rape to 10 years, and by adjusting the sentence of imprisonment for each charge of aggravated sexual assault by penetration to 8 years. I then ordered that the sentences of imprisonment for the second charge (aggravated rape) and the third charge (aggravated sexual assault by penetration) run consecutively <span class="font-italic">ie </span>making a total of 18 years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 I also sentenced the accused to the mandatory 12 strokes of the cane per each of the four charges but, as I have noted earlier, this was subject to the statutory maximum of 24 strokes provided for under s 328(6) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The aggregate imprisonment term of 18 years was backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest (22 February 2019).</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir SC, Yap Wan Ting Selene and Tan Si Ying Tessa (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leo Zhen Wei Lionel, Deya Shankar Dubey, Soh Kheng Yau Andre and Andrew Pflug (WongPartnership LLP) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
