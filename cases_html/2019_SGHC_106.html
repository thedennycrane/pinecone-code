OCBC claims against the Defendant for its failure to deliver to OCBC a cargo of palm oil to which 14 bills of lading in OCBC’s possession relate. OCBC had extended a loan to the buyer of the cargo, Aavanti Industries Pte Ltd (“Aavanti”), for the purchase price of the cargo and took the bills of lading as security for the loan. OCBC’s loan to Aavanti was governed by a facility agreement made several years before. After Aavanti requested the loan but before OCBC granted it, the Defendant had discharged the cargo at the request of<span class="font-italic">, </span>and against a letter of indemnity (“LOI”) provided by, FGV Trading Sdn Bhd (“FGV”).

It also raises the issues of what constitutes relevant prior “contractual or other arrangements” for the purpose of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bills of Lading Act and what constitutes “good faith” for the purpose of s 5(2) of the Bills of Lading Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 11 March 2016, FGV entered into a voyage charterparty with the Defendant to charter <span class="font-italic">Yu</span><span class="font-italic">e You 902 </span>for two voyages.

</div> This is incorrect. Aavanti’s request for the loan was made by way of a handwritten annotation on OCBC’s request to Aavanti for payment instructions.

COGSA 1992 was enacted to address certain difficulties encountered with the Bills of Lading Act 1855 (UK), which tied the transfer of contractual rights of suit under a bill of lading to the passing of property in the goods to which the bill relates. (Prior to the enactment of the Bills of Lading Act 1855, transfer of a bill lading operated, at common law, to transfer constructive possession of the goods (as well as property in the goods, if so intended) but did not operate to transfer contractual rights under the contract of carriage contained in or evidenced by the bill. The Bills of Lading Act 1855 plugged this gap by providing that contractual rights of suit under a bill of lading would be transferred in cases where property in the goods “pass, upon or by reason” of the transfer of the bill.) First, COGSA 1992 decoupled the transfer of rights of suit from the passing of property. Secondly, to address the concern that decoupling the transfer of rights of suit from the passing of property could lead to potentially undesirable transfer of rights after a bill of lading is spent, COGSA 1992 imposes limits on the transfer of rights of suit in relation to spent bills. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Thus s 2(1) of COGSA 1992 provides for transfer of rights of suit to the lawful holder of a bill of lading “by virtue of [him] becoming the holder of the bill”. There is no longer a reference to the passing of property in the goods (as was the case with s 1 of the Bills of Lading Act 1855). Section 2(2) then carves out an exception for cases where “possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>“spent” bills). Section 2(2) provides that the transfer of a spent bill does <span class="font-italic">not</span> transfer any rights of suit unless ss 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies. Section 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) allows the transfer of a spent bill to have the effect of transferring rights of suit <span class="font-italic">if </span>the transfer of the bill was pursuant to “contractual or other arrangements” made <span class="font-italic">before</span> the bill became spent. Section 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) concerns rejection of goods or documents by a buyer, and is not relevant for present purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Defendant adopts a two-step submission. In the first step, the Defendant submits that, because OCBC became the holder of the bills of lading <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Defendant had completed delivery of the cargo to Ruchi, the bills have become spent before OCBC became their holder.

</div> Consequently, s 2(2) of the Bills of Lading Act applies, and no rights of suit could be transferred to OCBC unless OCBC can bring itself within s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). In the second step, the Defendant submits that OCBC’s situation does not fall within s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) because the relevant “contractual or other arrangements” for the purpose of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is the granting of the loan by OCBC to Aavanti.

Therefore, delivery to Ruchi on FGV’s instructions constituted delivery to a person entitled.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Alternatively, the Defendant urges the court to adopt a wider interpretation of s 2(2) of the Bills of Lading Act, and hold that s 2(2) applies once the carrier has parted with possession of the cargo irrespective of whether delivery was made to a person entitled or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I will deal first with the alternative submission at [38(b)] above, as it raises an issue which is conceptually antecedent to that raised in the Defendant’s primary submission at [38(a)] above. The key to assessing the correctness of this alternative submission is the meaning to be assigned to the phrase “possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates” in s 2(2), as the meaning of that phrase determines whether s 2(2) applies or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 After citing a passage from The Law Commission and The Scottish Law Commission, <span class="font-italic">Rights of Suit in Respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea</span> (Report, Law Com.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Defendant then suggested that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) no local cases have dealt with this point, as Belinda Ang Saw Ean J had left the point open in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Bandung Shipping Pte Ltd (Shweta International Pte Ltd and another, third parties)</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 611 (“<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the determination of this important issue mandates that the matter proceed to trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Taking the last argument first, there is no principle of law or procedure which says that an important point of law cannot be dealt with in summary judgment proceedings. This is especially so in the present case, where:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the resolution of the point of law does not involve any factual disputes; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) more than a year had elapsed between the initial filing of OCBC’s summary judgment application and the hearing before me, thus giving parties ample time and opportunity to research and submit on the relevant points of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Given the factual matrix, the Defendant submits that OCBC became the holder of the bills of lading only at 8:32pm on 29 April 2016, when OCBC remitted the funds to Maybank. To simplify the summary judgment proceedings, OCBC agreed to concede the point solely for the purposes of the summary judgment proceedings, while reserving its right to show, in subsequent stages of these proceedings (if it becomes necessary) that OCBC became the holder of the bills of lading before 29 April 2016. Since the funds were remitted to Maybank only after the discharge of cargo was completed, the implication of this concession is that, for the purposes of the summary judgment proceedings, I am obliged to assume that OCBC became holder of the bills of lading only after the Defendant had completely discharged the cargo and delivered it to Ruchi. For this reason, there are no relevant disputes of fact, for the purpose of the summary judgment proceedings, which touch on the issue of whether s 2(2) of the Bills of Lading Act applies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As for the argument at [41(a)] above, the Defendant is mistaken that Ang J had left the point of law open in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>. The relevant part of her judgment reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30        I also find that the cargo was delivered between the months of May and June 2000 to persons who were not entitled to possession so much so that BNP is not a holder of spent bills of lading (both switch and Batam bills). The contract of carriage generally continues and the bill of lading remains effective, until the goods are delivered to the person entitled under the bill of lading: see <span class="font-italic">The Future Express</span> [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 79. In that case, the bill of lading was not spent or exhausted as delivery was not to the person who had a right to demand delivery or was entitled to them. The goods were delivered against an indemnity to a person who did not have a right to delivery under the bill of lading. The decision was affirmed on grounds that made it unnecessary for the Court of Appeal to decide on the issue whether the bill of lading was spent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31        Even if a contrary view is taken that once the carrier has parted with possession of the cargo the bill of lading cannot transfer constructive possession of the cargo, BNP would be a holder who would come within the provisions of s 2(2) of the Bills of Lading Act and the extended definition of “holder” in s 5(2). A holder of a bill which is indorsed after delivery has taken place could still sue the carrier in contract: s 2(2). The holder must have become a holder by virtue of some prior transaction (ie facility agreement as in this case) before the bill of lading became spent: s 5(2)(c).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  Ang J could not have been clearer at [30] of <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span> that she was making a definitive finding. The sentence “I also find that the cargo was delivered … to persons who were not entitled to possession so much so that BNP is not a holder of spent bills of lading” could only mean that Ang J found that delivery to persons not entitled does <span class="font-italic">not</span> cause a bill of lading to be spent. The point made at [31] is merely an “even if” point to fully address all possibilities. It is not language used by a judge who wishes to leave a point open. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Therefore, contrary to the Defendant’s submission, the position under Singapore law has been clearly and definitively articulated in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which I respectfully follow. However, since <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>cited <span class="font-italic">The Future Express</span> [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 79 as authority for the proposition at [30], and since the correctness of certain <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">The Future Express </span>had been doubted in some textbooks, I will consider <span class="font-italic">The Future Express </span>in greater detail below. It suffices for the moment to note that the specific <span class="font-italic">dictum </span>from <span class="font-italic">The Future Express </span>which <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>relied on was <span class="font-italic">not </span>the subject of the said academic criticism.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Meaning of the phrase “possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I will begin my discussion with the Defendant’s argument, at [40] above, concerning the lack wording in s 2(2) to expressly limit its application to cases where the delivery of cargo was made to persons entitled under the bill of lading. The wording which the drafters of s 2(2) chose is “possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates” (“the Phrase in Question”). This language does not seek to catalogue in detail all the individual scenarios under which a bill would become spent. Instead, it is language describing a generic or overarching concept. It is therefore not surprising that specific scenarios, such as delivery to a person entitled, are not singled out for mention in s 2(2). The lack of specific reference in s 2(2) to particular scenarios (such as delivery to persons entitled) is merely a drafting technique to ensure that the Phrase in Question is crafted in a sufficiently general manner to include all instances where a bill of lading would become spent at law, without having to list out all the possible scenarios one by one. This manner of drafting is not evidence of a decision on the part of the drafters to create new categories of spent bills not previously known to law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my view, the Phrase in Question in s 2(2) and the similar phrase found in s 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bills of Lading Act refer to the document of title function of a bill of lading in transferring constructive possession of the goods to which the bill relates. That this is the reading intended by the drafters of COGSA 1992 is made abundantly clear in the Law Commission Report, which refers to “transfer [of] constructive possession” at para 2.42 and to “transferable document of title” at paras 2.22 and 2.44 and at p 53 in the explanatory note to cl 5(2) of the draft Bill. In <span class="font-italic">East West Corporation v DKBS 1912 </span>[2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 182 (“<span class="font-italic">East West Corp </span>(HC)”, Thomas J held, at [40], that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to me clear from the 1992 Act that the reference to the right to possess is a reference to one of the primary rights emanating from <span class="font-italic">the bill of lading’s function as a document of title</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On appeal, Mance LJ similarly held, in <span class="font-italic">East West Corporation v DKBS AF 1925 A/S and another </span>[2003] QB 1509 (“<span class="font-italic">East West Corp </span>(CA)”) at [44], that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, section 2(2) refers to the possibility of a person becoming the holder of a bill at a time “when … possession of the bill no longer gives a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates”, and to “the time when such a right to possession ceased to attach to possession of the bill”.

In that case, the cargo was totally lost when the vessel carrying it sank as a result of an explosion. As the buyer acquired the bill of lading after the destruction of the cargo, the issue was whether any rights of suit were transferred to the buyer pursuant to s 2(1) of COGSA 1992. In holding that the applicable provision for determining whether the buyer became holder of the bills was s 5(2)(c) of COGSA 1992, Aikens J reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70.       In my view, valuable assistance on the ambit of the words in s 5(2)(c) ‘at a time when possession of the bill no longer gave a right (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods” is gained from the analysis of Lord Hobhouse in his speech in <span class="font-italic">The Berge </span><span class="font-italic">Sisar</span>. In para [31] of his opinion, Lord Hobhouse notes that the 1992 Act is concerned solely with contractual obligations created in a bill of lading in relation to the carriage and delivery up of the goods. He emphasises that the Act is not dealing with proprietary rights of anyone who becomes a holder of the bill of lading. This distinction is important. It means that when a ship sinks and the cargo carried under a bill of lading is lost permanently, the question to ask in connection with the wording in section 5(2)(c) under consideration is: does possession of the bill of lading any longer give a <span class="font-italic">contractual right</span> (as against the carrier) to possession of the goods to which the bill relates?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 With respect to Aikens J, I believe Lord Hobhouse was not discussing s 5(2)(c) or s 2(2) at [31] of <span class="font-italic">The Berge </span><span class="font-italic">Sisar </span>[2002] 2 AC 205. Instead, Lord Hobhouse’s comment was directed specifically at s 3 of COGSA 1992. The relevant part of Lord Hobhouse’s remarks<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31] reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The important point which is demonstrated by <span class="font-italic">this part of the report</span> and carried into the Act is that it is the contractual rights, not the proprietary rights (be they general or special), that are to be relevant.

These paragraphs of the Law Commission Report dealt with what eventually became s 3 of COGSA 1992. That is a provision dealing with the mutuality of contractual relationship between the shipowner and the holder of a bill of lading who had contractual rights under the bill transferred to him. In my view, Lord Hobhouse’s comment that COGSA 1992 transfers contractual rights and not proprietary rights does not affect how the Phrase in Question should be understood. This is because the Phrase in Question does not purport to be an operative phrase transferring any rights. Instead, the Phrase in Question merely defines a condition which, if present, could dis-apply the operative provision for transfer in s 2(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further, as noted by Thomas J in <span class="font-italic">East West Corp </span>(HC), at [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rights transferred to the lawful holder under the 1992 Act are the “rights of suit”; this phrase was taken from the 1855 Act.

Since s 2(1), if applicable, would transfer the contractual right to possession, and the Phrase in Question determines whether s 2(1) applies, it would be circular to read the Phrase in Question as also referring to the contractual right to possession (as opposed to referring to constructive possession pursuant to the bill of lading’s function as a document of title). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Finally, <span class="font-italic">Aikens, Lord &amp; Bools</span> remarked, at para 8.49, that the phrase “right (as against the carrier) to possession”, which forms part of the Phrase in Question, did not appear in the Law Commission Report. To the extent that this remark may be taken as support for the view that the Phrase in Question, as enacted in s 2(2) should be given a different meaning from that envisaged in paras 2.42–2.44 of the Law Commission Report, I would point out that the remark is inaccurate. The phrase “right as against the carrier to possession” actually appears in para 2.42 of the Law Commission Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I do not think much turns on whether the Phrase in Question refers to the transfer of constructive possession or the transfer of contractual right to possession, if it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> suggested that the ambit of s 2(2) would be broader or narrower under one or the other view of the phrase. However, to the extent that it is suggested that the ambit of s 2(2) would differ according to whether the Phrase in Question is understood as referring to the contractual right to possession or to the transfer of constructive possession, I would prefer the view taken in <span class="font-italic">Scrutton</span><span class="font-italic">, Girvin, Palmer &amp; McKendrick, East West Corp </span>(HC) and <span class="font-italic">East West Corp </span>(CA) because it more closely reflects the recommendations and discussion in the Law Commission Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In other words, I hold that, irrespective of whether the Phrase in Question is understood as referring to the transfer of contractual right to possession or to the transfer of constructive possession, the Phrase in Question ought to be interpreted<span class="font-italic"> </span>as covering the situation where a bill of lading would at common law be regarded as spent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether a bill of lading is spent by delivery to a person <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to delivery under the bill</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On the basis of my holding that a “spent bill” for the purpose of s 2(2) covers the same ground as a spent bill at common law, I return to consider the Defendant’s submission that delivery by a carrier to a person <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to delivery under the bill of lading would cause the bill to be spent.  In my view, this submission goes against the position well established in the case law of the past 150 years, that delivery to a person not entitled does not cause a bill of lading to be spent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Barber v </span><span class="font-italic">Meyerstein </span>(1870) LR 4 HL 317, a bill of lading was pledged for a loan <span class="font-italic">after</span> the goods have been landed but were still held at the wharf on behalf of the shipowner pending payment of freight. It was held (at 330 and 332) that the bill was not yet spent at the time of pledge as the goods have not yet been delivered to a person entitled to possession of the same. More than a hundred years later, <span class="font-italic">Barber v </span><span class="font-italic">Meyerstein </span>continued to be cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Delfini </span>[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 252 (per Mustill LJ at 269). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 After the enactment of COGSA 1992, it was held in <span class="font-italic">East West Corp </span>(HC) that a bill of lading was not spent when the goods to which the bill relates were delivered to a person who had no right to take delivery of the goods and, consequently, s 2(2) of COGSA 1992 did not apply in such a situation (at [39]–[41]). More recently, in <span class="font-italic">The Erin Schulte </span>[2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 97 (“<span class="font-italic">The Erin Schulte </span>(CA)”), although it was common ground between parties at first instance that the bill of lading was spent when the cargo was delivered against a LOI from the seller, Moore-Bick LJ commented on appeal that this concession was wrongly made. As Moore-Bick LJ explained (at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was common ground below that by 7 July 2010, when [the seller] accepted payment from [the bank], the bill of lading no longer gave a right as against [the carrier] to possession of the goods to which it related because that right had been lost once discharge began on 15 June 2010. In my view, that was not in fact the case, because <span class="font-italic">the rights under the contract of carriage, including the right to obtain delivery of the goods from the carrier, did not cease when the goods were discharged against the letter of indemnity.</span><span class="font-italic"> They remained in existence and were capable of forming the basis of a claim against [the carrier] for misdelivery</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]<span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, delivery to the buyer against a seller’s LOI does <span class="font-italic">not </span>have the effect of bringing the matter within the ambit of s 2(2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In Singapore, it was held in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span> (at [30]) that delivery to a person not entitled does not cause the bill of lading to be spent. It was similarly held in the later case of <span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 374 that (at [5]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Even though the shipowner no longer has the goods, the bill of lading is not spent and as such it does not cease to be a transferable document of title. The contract of carriage generally continues and the bill of lading remains effective until the goods are delivered to the person entitled under the bill of lading…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Concerning the use of LOIs, I return to the case of <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Future Express </span>which I had discussed briefly at [46] above. In that case, the cargo was shipped in March 1985 and discharged at the destination and delivered to the buyer about two months later against a LOI from the seller. In the meantime, the seller had agreed at the buyer’s request to delay sending the shipping documents through the banking chain, in order to delay the moment when the buyer would need to reimbursement the buyer’s bank for payments made under the letter of credit. This meant that, at the time of discharge and delivery of the cargo, the seller was still in possession of the bills of lading. At the same time, the deadline for negotiation of the shipping documents under the letter of credit was extended by the buyer’s bank, at the buyer’s request, from July 1985 to September 1985 and then to December 1985. In December 1985, the buyer requested a further extension of the deadline for negotiation of documents to March 1986. By then the buyer’s bank had found out that cargo had already been discharged and delivered, but it nevertheless agreed to extend the deadline to March 1986. The seller put the shipping documents into the banking chain within this new deadline. After the buyer’s bank made payment under the letter of credit and failed to recover the payment from the buyer, it sued the shipowner under the bills of lading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As <span class="font-italic">The Future Express </span>was decided before the enactment of COGSA 1992, the transfer of contractual rights of suit under a bill of lading still depended on passing of property in the underlying goods. Judge Diamond QC therefore disposed of the case on the basis that the buyer’s bank was not a pledgee either because the seller did not intend to create a charge over the goods through delivery of the bills of lading (since passing of property is a matter of intention) or because the seller was incapable of creating a charge over the goods due to the <span class="font-italic">nemo </span><span class="font-italic">dat </span>rule (since general property in the goods had already passed by agreement from the seller to the buyer before the shipping documents were put in the banking chain) (at 93).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Judge Diamond QC then went on to discuss, in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, whether the bills of lading were exhausted as documents of title. After considering the authorities, Judge Diamond QC raised the hypothetical situation of “delivery of goods against an indemnity to <span class="font-italic">a person who was rightfully entitled to them had he surrendered the bill of lading</span>” (emphasis added) and suggested that he “would, however, be reluctant to hold that a bill of lading becomes exhausted as a document of title once the carrier has delivered the goods against an indemnity to <span class="font-italic">a person authoriz</span><span class="font-italic">ed to receive delivery</span>” (emphasis added) (at 99). He then went on to say:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not, however, necessary in the present case to express any concluded view on the question I have just discussed <span class="font-italic">since it is clear in any event that delivery of goods was </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">not</span><span class="font-italic"> made to some person having a right to claim them under the bills of lading</span>, within the test laid down by Mr. Justice Willes in <span class="font-italic">Meyerstein</span><span class="font-italic"> v. Barber.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In other words, Judge Diamond QC:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) held that delivery against a LOI to a person who is <span class="font-italic">not </span>entitled to claim them under the bills of lading does <span class="font-italic">not</span> exhaust a bill of lading and that, on the facts of the case, the buyer<span class="font-italic"> </span>was <span class="font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">a person entitled</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to delivery when the cargo was delivered to him against a LOI from the seller; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) expressed a preferred view (without deciding the point) that delivery to a <span class="font-italic">person entitled </span>under the bill of lading would also not exhaust the bill if the delivery is made against a LOI without surrender of the bill of lading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While the point at (b) above had been doubted in works like <span class="font-italic">Carver </span>(para 6-036)<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">Girvin </span>(para 8.34), <span class="font-italic">Scrutton</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(para 10-036, fn 137)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> Aikens, Lord &amp; Bools </span>(paras 2.95–2.96), none of these learned works took issue with Judge Diamond QC’s conclusion at point (a) above. In other words, the specific point in <span class="font-italic">The Future Express </span>which <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>relied on remains uncontroversial and the correctness of that point had not been doubted in the academic literature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 One might ask, if a bill of lading is spent only when delivery is made to a person entitled to delivery under the bill, would the scenario of trafficking in spent bills, as described in para 2.43 of the Law Commission Report ever arise? In other words, would not delivery to a person entitled involve presentation and surrender of the bill of lading to the carrier, thus leaving no room for the further transfer of the bill? Secondly, if a bill of lading is spent only if delivery is made to a person entitled to delivery under the bill of lading, would the fact that a bill is spent imply that there was no misdelivery? If so, would any purpose be served by transferring rights of suit to the holder of the bill of lading pursuant to s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) given that there would be no occasion for such a transferee to make claims for misdelivery against the carrier?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 With regard to the first group of questions, the premise that delivery to a person entitled under a bill of lading <span class="font-italic">necessar</span><span class="font-italic">ily</span> involves surrender of the full set of bill of lading to the carrier is incorrect. First, bills of lading are typically issued in sets of three originals (also described as “issued in three parts”). Bills issued in sets of three typically contain a clause which reads along the lines of: “one of which being accomplished, the others will be void”. A carrier is not obliged (and also not entitled) to call for the full set of bill of lading before making delivery. Instead, the carrier is obliged to deliver so long as any one of the three parts of the bill of lading is presented to him. (See <span class="font-italic">Scrutton</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 13-009, <span class="font-italic">Carver </span>at para 6-077 and <span class="font-italic">Aikens, Lord &amp; Bool </span>at para 5.65.) The carrier’s delivery against one part of the bill of lading would render all three parts spent. Therefore, in a situation where only one part of a bill of lading is presented to the carrier, there would be opportunities for the other two parts to be transferred or pledged separately from the first part. Examples of how this could happen are found in some of the older reported cases, such as <span class="font-italic">Barber v </span><span class="font-italic">Meyerstein </span>and <span class="font-italic">Glyn Mills Currie &amp; Co v The East and West India Dock Company </span>(1882) LR 7 App Cas 591 (“<span class="font-italic">Glyn Mills</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Barber v </span><span class="font-italic">Meyerstein</span>, the transferee of a bill of lading issued in three parts pledged two parts to Meyerstein and, two days later, pledged the third part to Barber, who obtained delivery of the cargo from the carrier using this third part of the bill of lading. In <span class="font-italic">Glyn Mills</span>, the consignee of a bill of lading issued in three parts pledged one part of the bill to a bank to secure a loan and then proceeded, without the bank’s knowledge or consent, to obtain delivery of the cargo from the carrier using the second part of the bill.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Secondly, while a carrier’s duty is to deliver on presentation of a bill of lading, the carrier is not obliged to retain the bill of lading so presented or require its surrender. This creates the possibility that all three parts of the bill may continue to remain physically in the hands of the party who received delivery of the cargo even though the bill has already been spent by the said delivery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Thirdly, the bill of lading would be spent by delivery to a person entitled to delivery under the bill of lading even if the delivery was made without the carrier sighting the bill of lading. While the carrier may be acting negligently and in breach of the contract of carriage for delivering without sight of the bill of lading, whether the bill is spent depends on whether delivery was made to the right person and not on whether the carrier <span class="font-italic">kn</span><span class="font-italic">ew </span>that he had delivered to the right person. Thus delivery to the right person would cause the bill to be spent even though the carrier had not ascertained whether the person receiving delivery was a person entitled. (This scenario is similar to the hypothetical situation discussed by Judge Diamond QC in <span class="font-italic">The Future Express </span>– see [65(b)] above. Like the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Carver, </span><span class="font-italic">Girvin</span>, <span class="font-italic">Scrutton</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> Aikens, Lord &amp; Bools</span>, I prefer the view that the bill of lading would be spent in such a situation.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Fourthly, cargo could have been delivered to a person who was expecting to receive, but had not yet received, the bill of lading. In that situation, delivery of the cargo before the arrival the bill of lading would not cause the bill of lading to be spent, as the person receiving the cargo was not yet the holder of the bill. (As noted in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Vigorous</span> at [5], “the shipowner…does not fulfil its contractual obligations if the goods are delivered to a person (even the cargo owner) who cannot produce the bill of lading”.) Nevertheless, the bill would become spent when the person who received delivery of the goods subsequently becomes the holder of the bill of lading. The bill of lading being the symbol of the goods, the office of the symbol is exhausted when the symbol is united with the goods (see <span class="font-italic">Barber v </span><span class="font-italic">Meyerstein </span>at 333, per Lord Hatherley, LC). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In each of the four scenarios described above, the risk of trafficking in a spent bill, as alluded to in para 2.43 of the Law Commission Report, would exist and therefore there remains a role to be fulfilled by s 2(2) in each of these scenarios.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As for the second group of questions at [66] above, the answer is that even in a case where there is no misdelivery, there could still be contractual rights of suit to transfer, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, for damage to cargo, short delivery, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For the foregoing reasons, I do not consider that s 2(2) would be rendered otiose if it were held that a bill of lading is spent only when delivery is made to a person entitled to delivery under the bill.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the light of the foregoing, my holdings on the Defendant’s alternative submission at [38(b)] above are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 2(2) of the Bills of Lading Act applies to a bill of lading which is regarded at common law as spent; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Delivery against a LOI to a person who is <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to delivery under the bill of lading does not cause the bill to be spent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether FGV was a person entitled to delivery under the bill of lading</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I turn now to the Defendant’s primary submission, at [38(a)] above, that FGV was a person entitled to delivery under the bill of lading.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Submissions, at paras 23, 27–28.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) at the time the cargo was being discharged, the bills of lading were in OCBC’s custody but, as the purchase price had not yet been paid, neither OCBC nor Aavanti could be regarded as the holder of the bills of lading;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) therefore, FGV remained the holder of the bills of lading at the time the cargo was being discharged;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) since delivery to Ruchi at FGV’s instructions amounts to delivery to FGV, the delivery was made to a person entitled to delivery under the bills of lading. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 This submission brings into issue the status of a seller under cost &amp; freight terms who had endorsed a bill of lading in blank and parted possession with it by sending it through the banking chain with a bill of exchange, to be delivered to the buyer on documents against payment basis. FGV had sold the cargo to Aavanti on “Incoterms CNF”. “CNF” is the old abbreviation for “cost &amp; freight”, now abbreviated as “CFR” under the International Chamber of Commerce’s rules on the use of domestic and international trade terms (“Incoterms 2010”). One of the key obligations of the seller under CFR terms is to provide the buyer with the “usual transport document for the agreed port of destination” which must, among other things, “enable the buyer to claim the goods from the carrier at the port of destination”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(obligation A8 for CFR, <span class="font-italic">Incoterms 2010</span> (International Chamber of Commerce, 2010), at p 102).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the present case, FGV blank endorsed the bills of lading and delivered them to the buyer through banking channels. The bills of lading were received by OCBC and presented to the buyer for acceptance <span class="font-italic">one day before</span> the discharge of the cargo commenced. The bills of lading were accepted by the buyer (when the buyer requested the trust receipt loan) and paid for by OCBC three days later, within hours after completion of the discharge operation. (The discharge operation lasted almost 40 hours.) The Defendant’s suggestion that, under the relevant contractual arrangements, a seller in FGV’s position would retain the ability to demand delivery of the cargo <span class="font-italic">as the lawful holder of the bills of lading</span> while the bills were physically with the buyer’s bank awaiting the buyer’s acceptance simply does not make sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In my view, it does not follow that, just because neither OCBC nor Aavanti had become persons entitled to delivery under the bills of lading, FGV would remain a person entitled to delivery under the bills of lading. Going back to first principles, it seems clear to me that a seller who endorsed a bill of lading and parted possession with it for the purpose of obtaining payment would have rendered himself incapable of demanding delivery under the bill of lading for the simple reason that he would be in no position to present the bill of lading to the carrier in exchange for delivery of the cargo. In such a situation, the seller would only regain his entitlement to delivery of the cargo under the bill of lading if the bill were to be re-delivered to him through the banking chain (typically, this would happen if the buyer does not take up the bill). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Support for this view is found in <span class="font-italic">The Erin Schulte </span>(CA). In that case, Moore-Bick LJ held that the buyer’s bank became holder of the bill of lading only when it eventually made payment under the letter of credit on 7 July 2010 (at [56]), and not when the bill of lading was initially presented to it by the seller’s bank on 4 June 2010.  Moore-Bick LJ then noted (at [57]) that, after the buyer’s bank informed on 9 June 2010 that it considered the shipping documents to be non-compliant with the letter of credit, the buyer was entitled to demand the return of the bill of lading for the purpose of taking delivery of the cargo from the carrier. Instead, the buyer chose to issue a LOI to the carrier for the carrier to discharge the cargo without bill of lading (while leaving the bill of lading with the buyer’s bank). As noted at [60] above, Moore-Bick LJ’s view is that discharge of the cargo under such circumstances did <span class="font-italic">not</span> cause the bill of lading to be spent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Furthermore, any claim that FGV was acting as lawful holder of the bills of lading when it gave instructions concerning delivery is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the relevant documents. FGV’s delivery instructions to the Defendant is contained in its LOI to the Defendant dated 22 April 2016. It reads:

</div> The delivery instructions from FGV assumed that delivery ought legally to have been made against the original bill of lading, but explained that the bill of lading had not arrived, thereby giving rise to the need for FGV to give the carrier an indemnity to deliver without presentation of the bill of lading. This is not the language used by a party claiming to be entitled to delivery under the bill of lading as lawful holder. Instead, it is language used by a party who recognised that it was not, at the material time, a person entitled to delivery under the bill of lading. Were it otherwise, FGV’s delivery instructions would have simply asserted that FGV, as lawful holder of the bill of lading, was demanding delivery against presentation of the bills of lading. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Carver</span>, the practice of delivery against LOI is “based on the assumption that in law delivery can be claimed, and can be claimed only, by the holder of the bill” (at para 6-009).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the final analysis, it does not matter that, at the material time, neither OCBC nor Aavanti had yet become persons entitled to delivery under the bill of lading. The fact that OCBC had not yet become entitled to delivery under the bill does not necessarily mean that FGV continued to remain a person entitled. Whether FGV was entitled to delivery under the bill of lading would depend on (a) whether the bill was endorsed to it or, alternatively, was blank endorsed, and (b) whether it had possession of the bill of lading such that it was in a position to present the bill of lading to the carrier in exchange for delivery of the cargo. FGV did not meet criterion (b) at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For the foregoing reasons, I hold that neither FGV nor Ruchi were persons entitled to delivery under the bills of lading at the time the cargo was being discharged and delivered to Ruchi.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, I also considered whether the existence of cl 11 in the voyage charterparty, which obliges the Defendant to deliver against a LOI from FGV if bills of ladings are not available (see [6] above), would make any difference to the foregoing analysis. This point was considered in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>, where Ang J analysed the issue in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 The bills provide that all conditions, liberties and exceptions of the relevant charterparty are incorporated in the conditions of carriage. Clause 16 is identical in both charterparties. Clause 16 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the absence of original b/ls at discharge port(s), owners to release the entire cargo to receivers against charterers’ LOI (Shweta or Lanyard) without bank guarantee. (LOI wording always to be in Owners’ P and I Club format.)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Clause 16 recognises the need to present the bill of lading for Bandung to deliver the cargo. It also reflects Bandung’s willingness to run the risk of being held liable for wrongful discharge of cargo should problems arise in relation to payment. The right of the holder of a bill of lading is not taken away by a provision for the vessel to discharge against a letter of indemnity even though the vessel would arrive at the discharge port ahead of the bill of lading. Tamberlin J in <span class="font-italic">The Stone Gemini</span> [1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 255 considered a similar clause. He stated at 266:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The letter of indemnity is designed to provide a remedy for a shipowner, where the master releases cargo at the request of a party, in respect of claims which may be brought as a consequence of such release. It is not an authority by the holder of the bearer bill of lading for the shipowner to deliver the cargo to whoever produces a letter of indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 Clarke J in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Sormovskiy</span> <span class="font-italic">3068</span> said at 274:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of the clause was to ensure that the defendants would discharge the cargo even if the bill of lading was not available for presentation, but on terms that they would be protected by a letter of indemnity. It thus contemplated that they would be liable to the holder of the bill of lading if they delivered otherwise than in return for an original bill of lading.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68 Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">The Nordic Freedom </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 507 considered a clause similar to cl 16 and came to the same conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 Accordingly, cl 16 and its incorporation in the bills of lading cannot on a proper consideration provide a defence to wrongful discharge of the cargo against letters of indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I agree with the foregoing analysis and would similarly hold that the existence of cl 11 in the charterparty in the present case does not affect the conclusion I have reached at [83] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Conclusion on whether the bills of lading were spent</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In the light of the matters discussed above, I hold that the bills of lading were not spent by the time OCBC become holder of the bills.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assuming the bills of lading were spent, whether OCBC came within s 2(2)(a)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Assuming I was wrong on the question of whether the bills of lading were spent when the cargo was discharged, and assuming therefore that s 2(2) applies, the issue then is whether OCBC had become holder of the bills “by virtue of a transaction effected in pursuance of any contractual or other arrangements” made before the time when the bills had become spent (s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The key terms in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are “transaction”, “in pursuance of” and “contractual or other arrangements”.

As explained in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Ythan</span>, the term “transaction” refers to the physical process by which the bill is transferred from one person to another (at [66]) while “contractual or other arrangements” refers to the reason or cause for the transfer (at [84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">The David </span><span class="font-italic">Agmashenebeli </span>[2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 92, Colman J held that, for a transfer to be regarded as having been “effected in pursuance of any contractual or other arrangements”, it has to be a transfer “provided for by the antecedent contractual or other arrangements” or “called for” by the contractual or other arrangements (at 118). In <span class="font-italic">The Pace </span>[2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 183, Teare J noted (at [45]) that the use of the term “called for” by Colman J suggested a requirement that a transferee needed to be entitled to the transfer of the bill of lading pursuant to the terms of the contractual or other arrangements. Teare J considered this requirement to be unnecessarily strict having regard to the fact that the object and purpose of s 2(2) was to prevent “trafficking in bills of lading simply as pieces of paper which give causes of action against sea carriers” (at [48]). Instead, Teare J suggested that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the objective or aim of section 2(2)(a) to avoid trafficking in bills of lading will be achieved if the <span class="font-italic">reason or cause</span> of the transfer is the contractual or other arrangements in existence before the bills were spent. Such an interpretation may have a wider scope than one based upon contractual entitlement…but it is nevertheless consistent with the aim or object of section 2(2)(a). It will avoid trafficking in bills of lading.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It was also suggested in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Ythan </span>that such “reason or cause” should be the “immediate reason and proximate cause of the transfer” (at [85]).  In <span class="font-italic">The Erin Schulte </span>[2013] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 338 (“<span class="font-italic">The Erin Schulte </span>(HC)”), Teare J disagreed that the test should be “immediate reason” or “proximate cause”. Instead, Teare J held that the test should be whether the contractual or other arrangement is the “real and effective cause” of the transfer (at [68]). On appeal, Moore-Bick LJ disagreed with Teare J in the following passage (<span class="font-italic">Erin Schulte </span>(CA) at [56]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not myself think that it is helpful to seek to identify the “real and effective cause” of the transfer. Given that section 2(2)(a) refers to a transaction effected in pursuance of a contractual or other arrangement, I think it is preferable simply to identify the arrangement, if any, pursuant to which the transfer was made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Moore-Bick LJ then went on to conclude that the payment (and thus acceptance of the bill of lading) by the buyer’s bank was pursuant to the letter of credit, notwithstanding that this was done after the letter of credit had expired and after the buyer’s bank had earlier decided not to honour the letter of credit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 At first blush, it may appear that, by paraphrasing “in pursuance of” simply as “pursuant to”, Moore-Bick LJ had merely restated the question rather than answered it. However, I believe that, in doing so, Moore-Bick LJ was emphasising that the phrase “in pursuance of” should be read simply as an ordinary English phrase, and that the phase should not be encrusted with legal concepts such as “real and effective cause”, “immediate reason or proximate cause”, “provided for”, “called for” or “contractual entitlement”. Thus <span class="font-italic">Scrutton</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>interprets <span class="font-italic">Erin Schulte </span>(CA) as requiring “merely that the pre-existing arrangement provides the trigger for the transfer, not that it creates a legal entitlement to the transfer of the bill of lading” (at para 3-022). In a similar vein, <span class="font-italic">Aikens, Lord &amp; Bools </span>commented that <span class="font-italic">Erin Schulte </span>(CA) had adopted “an apparently broad approach to causal connection” which “is to be welcomed” (at para 8.85). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Application to the facts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Turning to the facts of the present case, OCBC submits that, assuming s 2(2) applies, the relevant “transaction” would be Aavanti’s request for and OCBC’s grant of a trust receipt loan while the relevant “contractual or other arrangements” would be the facility agreement between OCBC and Aavanti. It was pursuant to the facility agreement (made in 2014 and amended in 2015) that Aavanti sought the loan and OCBC granted it.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Defendant submits that the “contractual or other arrangement” pursuant to which the bills of lading were transferred to OCBC was the trust receipt loan itself. This was because, under the facility agreement, OCBC retained the discretion whether to grant the loan, and was not obliged to grant loans to Aavanti on demand. Thus the facility agreement, by itself, did not give rise to a contractual entitlement for OCBC to call for the bills of lading. It was only pursuant to the trust receipt loan that OCBC’s entitlement to the bills arose.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 OCBC’s submission finds support in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>, which similarly involved a buyer’s bank who became holder of the bills of lading as pledgee. Ang J held that, if s2(2) applied, the facility agreement between the buyer’s bank and the buyer would constitute the relevant “contractual or other arrangement” (at [31]). On the other hand, the Defendant’s submission harks back to the approach suggested in <span class="font-italic">The David </span><span class="font-italic">Agmashenebeli </span>of asking whether the transfer of the bill of lading was “provided for” or “called for” by the “contractual or other arrangement” (see [89] above). But this approach is no longer good law in the light of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Erin Schulte </span>(CA). For the foregoing reasons, I would accept OCBC’s submission and follow <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>in holding that the relevant “contractual or other arrangement” is the facility agreement. It is undeniable that the request and grant of the trust receipt loan were made pursuant to the facility agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For completeness, I should add that, even if there was no facility agreement to rely on (or, alternatively, even if no reliance is placed on the facility agreement), OCBC could rely on the sale contract between FGV and Aavanti as the relevant “contractual or other arrangement”. Given the broad approach to causal connection adopted in <span class="font-italic">Erin Sc</span><span class="font-italic">hulte </span>(CA), and the consequent eschewing of the “provided for” or “called for” criteria suggested in <span class="font-italic">The David </span><span class="font-italic">Agmashenebeli</span>, there is no reason why the relevant “contractual or other arrangement” must be one which OCBC is a party to. In other words, if it can be said that the sale contract between Aavanti and FGV is a cause or reason for the trust receipt loan, the fact that OCBC was not a party to the sale contract is no obstacle to the sale contract being regarded as the relevant “contractual or other arrangement” for the purpose of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). In the preceding sentence, I referred to “a cause or reason” instead of “the cause or reason” in the light of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Erin Sc</span><span class="font-italic">hulte </span>(CA) that the relevant “contractual or other arrangement” <span class="font-italic">need</span> <span class="font-italic">not</span> be the “immediate reason”, “proximate cause” or “real and effective cause” of the transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Returning to the facts of the present case, since Aavanti requested the trust receipt loan from OCBC in order to carry out and fulfil the sale contract, and since OCBC’s grant of the trust receipt loan was to enable Aavanti to obtain the bills of lading and the underlying cargo pursuant to the sale contract, I see no difficulty holding that the trust receipt loan was a transaction “in pursuance of” the sale contract. The trust receipt loan served a legitimate commercial purpose (of trade financing) which flows from the sale contract between Aavanti and FGV. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As para 2.43 of the Law Commission Report made clear, the distinction is between “selling lawsuits as articles of commerce” and “taking an assignment where one has genuine commercial interest in so doing”. OCBC’s grant of the trust receipt loan <span class="font-italic">before </span>Aavanti could obtain the bills of lading and with a view to allowing Aavanti to take delivery of the bills of lading subject to OCBC’s security interest in the bills clearly falls within the situation of “taking an assignment where one has genuine commercial interest in so doing”. It is therefore definitely not a situation of “trafficking in bills of lading <span class="font-italic">simply </span>as pieces of paper which give causes of action against sea carriers” (emphasis added) which the said para 2.43 was addressing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the foregoing reasons, I hold that, even if it were assumed that s 2(2) applies, OCBC would come within the scope of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), and would therefore have obtained rights of suit under the bills of lading pursuant to s 2(1) of the Bills of Lading Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Issue 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In the light of my conclusions at [86] and [98] above, and subject to the discussion on “lawful holder” and “good faith” in the next section, I hold that the Defendant has failed to raise a triable issue on whether OCBC had acquired rights of suit in respect of the bills of lading pursuant to s 2(1) of the Bills of Lading Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Was the plaintiff a holder of the bills of lading in good faith?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Bills of Lading Act distinguishes between a mere “holder” of a bill of lading and a “lawful holder” of a bill of lading. Sections 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) define three situations in which a person not originally party to a bill of lading would become the “holder” of the bill of lading. The proviso at the end of s 5(2)goes on to provide that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…a person shall be regarded for the purposes of this Act as having become <span class="font-italic">the lawful holder</span> of a bill of lading wherever he has become the <span class="font-italic">holder of the bill in good faith</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides for the transfer of contractual rights of suit to a “lawful holder”.

The Court of Appeal further commented, at [40], that “[i]t is obviously to preclude the case where possession is obtained unlawfully, or by other improper means, that s 5(2) prescribes that the person (be he the named consignee or an indorsee) must become the holder ‘in good faith’.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Defendant seized upon the Court of Appeal’s reference to “other improper means” at [40] of <span class="font-italic">UCO Bank </span>to argue that the Court of Appeal did not intend, by its remarks at [39] to confine the meaning of “good faith” <span class="font-italic">only </span>to honest conduct.

</div> The Defendant therefore submitted that the scope of “good faith” could be developed incrementally by the courts, including to consider whether it is contrary to good faith for a holder to take possession of bills of lading to obtain a bare right of suit against a carrier without any real interest in the goods under the bills of lading.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I do not accept the Defendant’s submission. First, given the bill of lading’s status as a document of title used in international sales, the transfer of which could in law transfer the property in the underlying goods or the right to possess those goods, I agree fully with Thomas J that the meaning of “good faith” in the Bills of Lading Act should take reference from its meaning in the law of sale of goods. In this regard, I would note that s 47(2) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SOGA”) also contains a specific provision dealing with the transfer of a document of title to a person “who takes it in good faith and for valuable consideration”. There is therefore much to be said for aligning the meaning of the term “good faith” in the Bills of Lading Act with the meaning which that term would bear in s 47(2) of SOGA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Secondly, as noted by Thomas J, in the commercial context of bills of lading, the meaning of the term good faith should be clear and capable of unambiguous application. This consideration militates against the Defendant’s submission that the meaning of good faith in the Bills of Lading Act should be left open-ended to be developed by the court from case to case. In fact, the suggestion that “good faith” should be given a broad meaning in COGSA 1992 was specifically considered and expressly rejected by Thomas J in <span class="font-italic">The Aegean Sea</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Thirdly, it is clear that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UCO Bank </span>did not intend, by the term “other improper means” at [40], to undo its very clear pronouncement at [39] concerning the scope of “good faith” in s 5(2). This is especially since the Court of Appeal had specifically cited Thomas J’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">The Aegean Sea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and expressly adopted it.

</div> While I find OCBC’s objection cogent, it is not necessary (for the reasons given below) for me to rule on that objection. The statement in Aavanti’s affidavit, even if admitted as evidence in these proceedings, is a bare assertion. Aavanti claimed in the affidavit that it had conveyed its practice of securing discharge of cargo by LOI to the institutional lenders “via correspondence or at face-to-face meetings” but failed to exhibit any such correspondence.

</div>
</div> Aavanti did not allege that OCBC had actual knowledge that <span class="font-italic">Yue You 902 </span>had discharged the cargo before OCBC decided to grant the loan in respect of the cargo. In other words, Aavanti’s affidavit contains no evidence of OCBC’s actual knowledge concerning when the cargo on <span class="font-italic">Yue You 902 </span>was discharged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As for the expert opinion, I find it largely speculative since it is not grounded on actual evidence concerning how OCBC operates. At most, the expert opinion stands for the propositions that OCBC would have general knowledge that LOIs may be used in the trade of certain commodities involving short voyages and that OCBC would have the ability, had it decided to do so, to find out whether the cargo has been discharged (by asking either IMB or Aavanti). Again, there is no allegation that OCBC <span class="font-italic">actually</span> knew that the cargo had already been discharged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I am therefore not persuaded that the Defendant has raised a substantial dispute of fact over OCBC’s actual knowledge. However, even if I were to consider that the Defendant has raised a substantial dispute of fact over OCBC’s actual knowledge, it does not necessarily mean that the Defendant has successfully raised a triable issue. This is because it cannot be said that a decision by OCBC to grant the trust receipt loan, even assuming it already knew that the cargo had been discharged, constitutes dishonest conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 First, this is not a case of OCBC obtaining the bills of lading by theft, fraud or deception. OCBC provided valuable consideration (in the form of the loan to Aavanti) in return for a security interest in the bills of lading. Secondly, OCBC received the bills of lading from the seller who sent it through banking channels. This is good indication that the bills could not have been spent bills in OCBC’s hands, even if the cargo were to be discharged and delivered by the carrier while the bills were in OCBC’s possession. This is because any such delivery would not be delivery to a person entitled to delivery under the bills of lading (since any person receiving such delivery would, at the time of delivery, not be in possession of the bills). This is to be contrasted with the situation where a bank receives the bill of lading directly from the buyer (and not from the seller through the banking chain). In that situation, there could be a risk that the buyer may have already obtained delivery of the cargo with the bills of lading, thereby causing it to be spent, before attempting to pledge it with the bank. Therefore, as far as OCBC was concerned, the bills of lading remained, by all appearances, effective and valid documents of title. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Thirdly, Aavanti did not simply ask for a loan from OCBC. It asked specifically for a <span class="font-italic">trust receipt</span> loan. The exact words used by Aavanti was “Kindly grant us TR for USD 7454973.16”.

</div>
</div> In respect of trust receipt loans, <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2017) explained (at para 18-286):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where bills of ladings are held, generally by a bank, as security for an advance, it is often necessary for the debtor (often a buyer of the goods) to sell the goods in order to obtain the funds required to repay the advance. This need may be satisfied, and the interests of the bank to a large extent protected, by the use of trust receipts. These documents are by no means uniform in content, but their essential features are as follows. They provide for the release by the bank of the bills of lading to the debtor as trustee for the bank, and authorise him to sell the documents or the goods on behalf of the bank. The debtor, for his part, undertakes to hold the goods and their proceeds in trust for the bank, and to remit the proceeds to the bank, at least up to the amount of the advance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, when Aavanti requested a trust receipt loan, the request constituted a proposal to pledge the bills of lading to OCBC as security for the loan as well as an indication that Aavanti planned to obtain physical delivery of the bills of lading from OCBC against a trust receipt in order to transfer the same to its sub-buyer. This amounts to a representation by Aavanti to OCBC that the bills of lading remained documents which could be meaningfully pledged as security for the loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The undisputed facts therefore demonstrate that OCBC’s granting of the loan in return for a security interest over the bills of lading constitutes honest conduct. In fact, the Defendant did not dispute that OCBC had acted honestly. That explains why Defendant had submitted that the requirement of “good faith” in s 5(2) ought to be given a broader meaning than “honest conduct”.

That fact of and in itself, <span class="font-italic">even with the knowledge of BNP</span>, cannot give rise to any actual [or] implied authority to [the buyer] to instruct the shipowner to discharge cargo without the relevant bills of lading. … It is clear from Low’s evidence that the bank looked to the document of title as security and it made no sense for the bank to destroy its own security if it were to consent to release of cargo against a letter of indemnity. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Nederlandsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Handel-Maatschappij v Strathlorne Steamship Company </span>(1931) 39 Lloyd’s Rep 171, a case decided in the Scottish Court of Session, Lord Anderson held (at 175–176) that the defence of consent implied that “something was said or done by the pursuers which affected the mind of the master of the ship, induced him to conclude that they were consenters, and thus encouraged him to make delivery without production of the bills of lading”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In the present case, the Defendant was not able to point to anything said or done by OCBC which could have induced the Defendant<span class="font-italic"> </span>to conclude that OCBC had consented to the delivery of the cargo without bill of lading. In fact, the Defendant accepts that there were no communications between OCBC and the Defendant prior to the discharge of the cargo. More importantly, the Defendant’s submission is that OCBC’s consent was expressed through the grant of the loan. Since it is common ground that the loan was granted only after the discharge of cargo was completed, there could have been no <span class="font-italic">prior consent</span> by OCBC to the discharge of the cargo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Nor could OCBC’s grant of the trust receipt loan be construed as <span class="font-italic">ex post facto </span>consent to, or ratification of, the misdelivery. OCBC’s decision to grant a trust receipt loan (as opposed to other types of loan) and take the bills of lading as security is clearly inconsistent with any intention to waive its contractual rights of suit against the Defendant under the bills of lading. Subsequent to the granting of the loan, nothing was said or done by OCBC which could be construed as ratification of the misdelivery or waiver of OCBC’s rights of suit. When Aavanti defaulted on the loan, OCBC promptly claimed against the Defendant under the bills of lading. Instead of telling OCBC that it had no claim because it had consented to the misdelivery and therefore waived its rights of suit, the Defendant’s reaction to OCBC’s claim on 14 June 2016 was to immediately institute its own claim on 17 June 2016 against FGV under the LOI.

And yet the Defendant’s delivery against a LOI is precisely an acknowledgement and acceptance that they are <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to deliver without presentation of the bills, and might become liable for misdelivery otherwise. The Defendant’s acceptance of and reliance on FGV’s LOI demonstrates that it was not mistaken about it legal rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I did not view it as necessary to dwell on the other requirements, but I will mention that it was equally clear that the Defendant could not succeed on the fifth requirement either.

</div> As <span class="font-italic">Nasaka</span> at [80] makes clear, for this requirement to hold, there must be something which OCBC’s silence did to cause the Defendant to undertake some action it would not otherwise have done. On the facts of the present case, the Defendant had the benefit of FGV’s LOI to cover the Defendant for potential liabilities under the bills of lading for misdelivery. Such potential liabilities were expressly referred to in clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the LOI.

</div> Delivery of the cargo without the bills of lading was therefore an act undertaken by the Defendant in full knowledge that it would be exposed to liabilities under the bills of lading. Defendant was induced to undertake such exposure because of the coverage provided by the LOI (and which it in fact sought to enforce) and not because of OCBC’s silence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 To put it another way, the Defendant well knew what its legal obligations under the bills of lading were and OCBC had no duty to reach out to the Defendant to remind the Defendant to comply with the well-established legal obligations of a carrier under a bill of lading. Those obligations existed before OCBC came into the picture and OCBC’s silence did nothing to take them away.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Estoppel by convention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In relation to the defence of estoppel by convention, the Defendant claimed that both OCBC and Aavanti (on its behalf and on behalf of the Defendant) had contemplated the fact that the cargo would be discharged without the presentation of the bills of lading.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Submissions, at para 115.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In support of this submission, the Defendant cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering Pte Ltd v United Malayan Banking Corp</span><span class="font-italic"> Bhd </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 465 (“<span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span>, the plaintiff company sued the defendant bank for making wrongful payment from the plaintiff’s bank account against forged cheques. The manner in which the cheques were forged gave rise to a strong suspicion that the forgery was committed by a person within the plaintiff’s organisation (at [10]–[11]). Noting that “O 14 is for the plain and obvious and not for the devious and crafty” (at [19]), the court observed (at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No doubt, the defendants are unable to point to a specific defence, but, in theory, the following scenarios are possible: (a) that, assuming that the defendants accept the conclusions of the handwriting expert, the cheques were copied by the signatories themselves, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> they are “self-forgeries”; (b) that the signatures were copied with the knowledge or consent of both the signatories or one of them; (c) that the signatures were copied by or with the knowledge or consent of the controlling mind of the plaintiffs, whoever he may be at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court therefore granted unconditional leave to defend because “the circumstances are such that the defendants ought, in the interest of justice be given time and with it the opportunity to investigate further the fraud by whatever means that are available to them, including a trial, to determine for themselves whether they are liable as bankers” (at [17]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The first point of distinction between the present case and <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering </span>is that the Defendant is not suggesting there was fraud or forgery on the part of OCBC or any of its employees. The second point of distinction is that any of the three potential scenarios listed at [18] of <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span>, if found to be true after investigation, would have afforded the defendant bank a viable defence. In comparison, given the view I have taken of the various defences discussed above, even if the Defendant succeeds in proving that OCBC had actual knowledge that the cargo had been discharged, the Defendant would still not have a viable defence against OCBC’s claim. For these reasons, the Defendant has failed to make out a case that there ought to be “some other reason” for the matter to go to trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Quantum of damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Citing <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages </span>(Harvey McGregor) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">McGregor</span>”) at para 30-003, the Defendant submits that the normal measure of damages for non-delivery under a contract of carriage is the market value of the goods at the time and place at which they should have been delivered less the amount it would have cost to get to the place of delivery. Later in the same passage, <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>clarified that this normal measure is on the assumption that the carriage freight had not been paid. Where freight had been paid (as in the present case) the measure of damages would simply be the market value of the goods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The Defendant then submitted that expert evidence would be required to determine the market value of the cargo at the time and place of delivery. I do not agree. A similar argument was raised in <span class="font-italic">He-Ro Chemical</span><span class="font-italic">s Ltd v Jeuro Container Transport (HK) Ltd </span>[1993] 2 HKC 368, where Kaplan J held (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, Mr Reyes submitted that even if I was against him, I should only order judgment for damages to be assessed because there is no evidence as to the value of the goods at the date of conversion. There is only the invoice value a little time before. I reject this argument as the defendants have not said a word on quantum, and if the market in zinc oxide had in fact fallen between the date of the contract and the date of misdelivery, I would expect them to file evidence on this point. The invoice value of the goods is, in my judgment, as good an indication of the value of the goods at the time of misdelivery as a court could reasonably expect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In the present case, there are two relevant indications of the value of the goods. In the sale contract between Aavanti and Ruchi dated 4 April 2016, the price of the palm oil was agreed at USD 776.50 per metric ton.
