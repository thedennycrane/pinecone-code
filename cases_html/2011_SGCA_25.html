<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In so far as the division of matrimonial assets
                    was concerned, the Judge ordered that the assets be divided in the ratio of
                    57 per cent to the husband and 43 per cent to the wife (see the GD at
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In so far as the issue of maintenance was
                    concerned, the Judge held as follows (see the GD at [7]-[8]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    I awarded a nominal maintenance of $1.00 for the
                            wife in the light of her employment and earning capacity and to preserve
                            her right to apply for maintenance in the event of changed employment or
                            earning capacity. With respect to the maintenance of the children,
                            taking into account the respective earnings of the parents, I ordered
                            that the [husband] and [wife] bear the costs of maintenance of the
                            children in the approximate proportions of 60%/40% respectively. The
                            wife estimated the monthly expenditure for the children and maid to be
                            as follows: eldest daughter S$2,401; second daughter S$2,100, third
                            daughter S$1,884 and maid S$842 per month. Following submissions by the
                            [husband] disputing these costs, I ordered that he pays S$3,500 per
                            month for the children’s maintenance and that this order take
                            effect from 1 May 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    The [wife] next sought arrears of maintenance as the
                            [husband] had not made any contribution for the maintenance of the
                            children since January 2009. The [husband] disclosed that the parties
                            had maintained a joint savings account in the [wife’s] name and as
                            of August 2008 there had been a balance of S$99,000 in this account
                            which has been reduced to S$11,000 by the [wife]. The [wife] explained
                            that she had used S$74,000 from this account to pay for a property
                            agent’s commission. In the light of this being disputed, I decided
                            to make no order relating to the arrears of payment by the [husband] of
                            the children’s maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The wife appealed in Civil Appeal No 94 of 2010
                    (“CA 94/2010”) against most of the Judge’s orders in
                    relation to the issue of custody, care and control as set out above (at
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>) – in particular,
                    Orders (b), (d), (e) and (g). She also appealed against the quantum of
                    maintenance (of $3500 per month) ordered by the Judge in favour the children.
                    Finally she appealed against the Judge’s decision in relation to the
                    division of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The husband, on the other hand, appealed in
                    Civil Appeal No 96 of 2010 (“CA 96/2010”) against the
                    Judge’s order of sole custody in favour of the wife as well as the
                    Judge’s computation of the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets
                    inasmuch as he claimed that the Judge had erred in failing to exclude the sum of
                    $395,000 which was a loan from his mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the end of oral submissions by the parties,
                    we affirmed the Judge’s decision for the reasons he delivered, with the
                    exception of certain orders. Consequently, we made the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the husband and wife have
                            <em>joint</em> custody of the children (the Judge
                        having awarded sole custody to the wife in the court
                    below);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     that if
                        there is an application to vary the orders relating to custody
                        (Orders (d) and (e)) and access (Order (g)) in the future, then
                            <em>the views of the children are to be taken into
                            account</em> – if appropriate, by way of interviews with the
                        judge concerned;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the $395,000 given by the husband’s mother does <em>not</em> form part of the pool of matrimonial assets
                        available for division between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     that the available pool of matrimonial assets be
                        divided <em>equally</em> between the parties;
                        and</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue of custody</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Turning first to the issue of custody, the
                    seminal decision is that of this court in <em>CX v CY (Minor:
                        custody and access)</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690
                        (“<em>CX v CY</em>”) (see also the
                    valuable commentary in Debbie Ong Siew Ling, “The Next Step in
                    Post-Divorce Parenting” (2005) 17 SAcLJ 648 and Chan Wing
                    Cheong, “Custody Orders, Parental Responsibility and Academic
                    Contributions: <em>CX v. CY (minor: custody and
                        access)</em>” [2005] Sing JLS 407). Indeed, it
                    appears that the principles laid down in this decision had – in certain
                    respects at least – been overlooked by the court below and we therefore
                    take this opportunity to remind all counsel not only of the significance of this
                    decision but also (and more specifically) of the relevant principles contained
                    therein. In this last-mentioned respect, we will set out the relevant passages
                    in the judgment in <em>CX v CY in extenso</em> by way of a
                    useful legal <em>aide mémoir</em> for all
                concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is important to observe, at the outset,
                    that the decision in <em>CX v CY</em> established that
                    there is <em>a clear and well-established distinction between
                        custody on the one hand and care and control on the other</em>. In
                    this regard, the following important observations (by Lai Siu Chiu J,
                    delivering the judgment of the court) merit being set out in full, as follows
                    (at [30]-[35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    It would be
                            appropriate at this juncture to define what “custody” and
                            “care and control” orders entail. <em>The
                                lack of an authoritative opinion on what each order involves has
                                contributed largely to the constant “custody”
                                disputes, and the law of custody in Singapore is in a state of
                                confusion because the demarcation between the two orders has not
                                been made clear. Often, in an attempt to limit the powers of the
                                custodial parent, which is indicative of a trend towards joint or no
                                custody orders in support of joint parenting, the definition of
                                “custody orders” has been muddled with that of
                                “care and control orders”</em> (see <em>L v L</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 529 at [21]). The
                            statutes are also of little assistance in the definition of either
                            order. The [Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed)] is
                            silent as to the definition of “custody orders”, and the
                            closest definition we have is in s 126(1) of the [Women’s
                            Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)], which states that the person given
                            custody shall be entitled to decide all questions relating to the
                            upbringing and education of the child. The reference to
                            “non-custodial parent” in Form 27 of the Schedule,
                            pursuant to s 8(1)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial
                            Proceedings) Rules (Cap 353, R 4, 2004 Rev Ed), as the
                            “parent who does not live with the child” also does not
                            help to clarify the law. It appears to give the impression that the
                            non-custodial parent is the parent who does not live with the child and
                            conversely, the custodial parent is the one who lives with the child.
                            This leaves out the possibility that a custodial parent, who is not
                            granted a care and control order, may also not live with the
                            child.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    
              <em>To
                                understand what each order entails, we must first realise that,
                                where parties are splitting up, custody as a general concept is
                                divided into two smaller packages, ie, “care and
                                control” and residual “custody”. In this
                                context, residual “custody” is no longer the same
                                concept as our general understanding of custody. Instead, residual
                                “custody” is the package of residual rights that
                                remains after the grant of a care and control order that dictates
                                which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom
                                the child shall live</em>. <b><em>To put it
                                simplistically, “care and control” concerns day-to-day
                                decision-making, while residual “custody” concerns the
                                long-term decision-making for the welfare of the
                            child</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    As was
                            appropriately summarised by Anthony Dickey in <em>Family
                                Law</em> (LBC Information Services, 3rd Ed, 1997) at
                            pp 326-327:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A]t common law, care and control concerns the right to take care of a
                            child and to make day-to-day, short-term decisions concerning the
                            child’s upbringing and welfare. Custody without care and control
                            (that is, custody in its narrow sense) concerns the right to make the
                            more important, longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and
                            welfare of a child.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    In other words, <em>a
                                “custody order” only gives the parent the residual
                                right</em> to decide on <em>long-term matters
                                affecting the child’s welfare</em>. For instance, the
                            right to decide on the type of education resides with the parent(s) with
                            custody as it concerns the more important and long-term aspects of a
                            child’s upbringing. The right to decide the particular school may
                            also reside with the custodian(s) depending on the importance of this
                            decision to the child’s education. However, the right to decide
                            how a child should dress or travel to school, what sport he should take
                            up or musical instrument he should play and similar ordinary day-to-day
                            matters, resides with the parent who has care and control. Such a
                            demarcation between the two types of orders proposed by Dickey is
                            generally consistent with our local jurisprudence where matters such as
                            choice of schools, tutors or healthcare have been regarded as matters
                            for the custodian(s) to decide (for example, see <em>Yeap
                                Albert v Wong Elizabeth</em> [1998] SGHC 97 at
                        [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    For the development of the law of custody, we deem
                            it necessary to lay down a general definition detailing the scope of
                            each order. <em>Our observation is that in most custody
                                cases, parties are simply concerned over which parent has care and
                                control and access. Parties labour under the mistaken impression
                                that if they are denied custody, they will be unable to see their
                                child anymore and will lose all contact with the child. We regret to
                                say that some family law practitioners further muddy the waters by
                                failing to advise their clients adequately as to what
                                “custody orders” actually entail. If parties are
                                assured of their respective rights to care and control and access,
                                we foresee lesser tension and acrimony in disputes over custody
                                issues</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    
              <em>Adopting this narrow definition
                                of “custody”, it appears that there will be relatively
                                few occasions where significant and longer-term decisions need to be
                                made for the child. Hence, parties will seldom need to come together
                                to make a joint decision even if joint or no custody orders were
                                granted. We should add that it is an almost impossible task for us
                                to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the
                                concept of residual custody</em>. The line is not always clear
                            as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term
                            decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices
                            to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and major
                            healthcare issues would fall into such a category.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Further, as this court pertinently observed in
                        <em>CX v CY</em> (at [18]–[19],
                        [21], [24], [26]-[29] and [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18     As a preliminary point, we noted that both
                        parties did not take issue with the judge’s variation of the district
                        judge’s “no custody order” to that of a “joint
                        custody order”. We should make it clear from the outset that a
                        “no custody order” is not tantamount to depriving both parents
                        of custody. It is generally accepted that the practical effects of a
                        “no custody order” and a “joint custody order”
                        are similar where a “care and control order” has been made. In
                        the normal course of events, the parents of a child will have joint custody
                        over him. We thus agree with Prof Leong Wai Kum’s comments in
                            <em>Principles of Family Law in Singapore</em>
                        (Butterworths Asia, 1997) at pp 538-539 that the making of a “no
                        custody order” should be seen as leaving the law on parenthood to
                        govern the matter, as both parents continue to exercise joint custody over
                        the child. Such an order also affirms the approach of the courts not to
                        intervene unnecessarily in the parent-child relationship where there is no
                        actual dispute between the parents over any serious matters relating to the
                        child’s upbringing (see <em>Re Aliya Aziz
                            Tayabali</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 894 and <em>Re G
                            (guardianship of an infant)</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 229
                            (“<em>Re G</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19     Since the practical effects of a
                        “no custody order” and “joint custody order” are
                        similar, the more important question to address is: Under what circumstances
                        should a “no custody order” be preferred over a “joint
                        custody order”? As mentioned earlier, where there is no actual
                        dispute between the parents over any serious matters relating to the
                        child’s upbringing, it may be better to leave matters at status quo,
                        and not to make any custody order. As was suggested by Assoc Prof Debbie Ong
                        in her article <em>“</em>Making No Custody
                        Order: <em>Re G (Guardianship of an
                        Infant)</em>” [2003] SJLS 583 at p 587-588, in other
                        circumstances where there is a need to prevent parties from drawing the
                        child into the battle over the extent of their custodial powers, or where
                        there is a need to avoid any possibly negative psychological effect that
                        comes about when one parent “wins” and the other parent
                        “loses” in a custody suit, it may also be appropriate not to
                        make any custody order.</p>

                            the judge’s view on the law of custody was consistent with

                            should be clarified. <em>Helen Ho</em> was

                                that joint custody should only be made where there is a reasonable
                                prospect that the parties will co-operate is no longer appropriate

                                joint parenting. We believe that, generally, joint or no custody
                                orders should be made, with sole custody orders being an exception
                                to the rule</em></b>. We will now elaborate on our
                        views.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    This idea of
                                <b><em>joint parental responsibility</em></b> is
                                <em>deeply rooted in our family law
                                jurisprudence</em>. <em>Section 46(1) of
                                the Women’s Charter</em> (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)
                            (“the Charter”) exhorts both parents to make equal
                            co-operative efforts to care and provide for their children.
                            Article 18 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the
                            Child 1989, to which Singapore is a signatory, also endorses the view
                            that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and
                            development of their child. Similarly, jurisdictions like England and
                            Australia have adopted approaches that impose on both parents the
                            concept of life-long parental responsibility. With parliamentary
                            intervention in these jurisdictions, the very concept of custody orders
                            was abolished as it was acknowledged that it was in the interests of the
                            child to have both parents involved in his life. There can be no doubt
                            that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the
                            love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not
                            change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus, in any
                            custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote
                            joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct
                            involvement in the child’s
                            life.</p>

              <em>We
                                note that local academic opinion has long advocated using the law of
                                custody to preserve joint parental responsibility</em>. The
                            making of joint or no custody orders is very much in the welfare of the
                            child. As was aptly put by Debbie Ong in her article, <em>“</em>Parents and Custody Orders - A New
                            Approach” [1999] SJLS 205 at p 223:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">When a marriage breaks up, the child is in fear of losing his parents,
                            his siblings and his familiar home. Joint custody protects the child
                            from the reality and the fear of losing a parent. A child who can
                            understand that both his parents have custody of him and be assured that
                            both parents continue to be involved in his life may feel more secure.
                            He will feel less abandoned even though family life has to undergo some
                            changes. If the child believes that both his parents are still
                            cooperating and raising him together despite the breakdown of their own
                            relationship, he may be spared from suffering “from a conflict of
                            loyalties”. Further, in granting joint custody, parents are
                            expected to consult each other regarding important matters and it is
                            beneficial that the perspectives from a mother and a father are brought
                            together in a decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    
              <b><em>More significantly, we feel
                                that the making of joint or no custody orders reminds the parents
                                that the law expects both of them to co-operate to promote the
                                child’s best interest</em></b>. <em>With the
                                grant of joint or no custody orders, the likelihood of the
                                non-custodial parent being excluded from the child’s life is
                                much reduced. It also encourages the parent who does not reside with
                                the child to continue to play his or her role in joint
                                parenthood</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    
              <em>Accordingly, we agree with the
                                recognition by the judge below that joint custody</em>
<b><em>can still be ordered even if there is an
                                apprehension that the parties may be unable to agree</em></b>.
                                <em>This is a move in the right direction</em><b><em>in support of joint parenting</em></b>. Recent
                            cases have revealed an emerging trend where the courts are no longer
                            inclined to assume that sole custody orders should be made simply
                            because parents display animosity towards each other in the midst of
                            litigation. As Tan Lee Meng J rightly observed in <em>Re G</em> ([18] <em>supra</em>)
                            at [8], even where the parents have an acrimonious relationship at the
                            time of the custody proceedings, making a sole custody order is not the
                            only possible outcome. We have mentioned earlier that cases like
                                <em>Helen Ho</em> must be viewed in their
                            proper perspective and should not always be relied on to justify an
                            order for sole custody merely because the child’s parents have an
                            acrimonious relationship. <em>Helen Ho</em> was a
                            unique case in itself where there was cruelty on the part of the father.
                            Moreover, Winslow J made the statement in response to a request for
                            joint custody, as well as care and control orders. It is obvious that a
                            joint care and control order, requiring the parties to agree on every
                            day-to-day decision relating to the child, is unworkable where the
                            parties have a bitter relationship with each other. However, a joint
                            custody order is of a different nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    
              <em>We would emphasise that recent
                                decisions have been inclined towards making joint or no custody
                                orders due to the need to ensure that the child becomes attached to
                                both parents</em>. The idea behind joint or no custody orders
                            is <b><em>to ensure that neither parent has a better right
                                over the child and that both have a responsibility to bring the
                                child up in the best way possible. Similarly, the child has a right
                                to the guidance of both his parents. Parenthood is a lifelong
                                responsibility and does not end at a particular age of the child,
                                but continues until the child reaches adulthood</em></b>. The
                            question we have to answer will <b><em>always</em></b> be
                                <b><em>what is best for the child in the future. We
                                agree with Assoc Prof Debbie Ong that the exceptional circumstances

                            (see Debbie Ong, “Making No Custody Order” ([19] <em>supra</em>) at p 586), <b><em>or where

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The principles set out above are of special
                    relevance in the context of the present appeal as counsel for the wife,
                    Mr Koh Tien Hua (“Mr Koh”), argued that the <em>sole</em> custody order made by the Judge in the court below
                    in favour of the wife was the appropriate order as the husband had been
                    uncooperative and disruptive throughout. However, given the very nature of
                    divorce proceedings, a certain (or even high) degree of animosity between the
                    former husband and wife must (unfortunately) be expected. Hence, as correctly
                    pointed out by this court in <em>CX v CY</em> (at [24], also quoted in the preceding paragraph),
                    “acrimony alone was not sufficient to justify a sole custody
                    order”. More importantly, as the same decision emphasises, there is a
                    highly significant concept that not only cannot be ignored but must also be
                    given effect to, <em>viz</em>, that of <em>joint parenting</em>. As the extracts from the decision in <em>CX v CY</em> quoted in the preceding paragraph underscore,
                    sound and effective parenting is best achieved when <em>both</em> parents are involved. This is both logical and
                    commonsensical. The input by <em>both</em> parents
                    furnishes a <em>balance</em> that enhances the development
                    of that child (or those children, as the case may be) until adulthood is
                    reached. In contrast, the <em>exclusion</em> of one of the
                    parents in this particular regard would – absent an exceptional reason
                    – contribute towards a <em>less</em> balanced as well
                    as <em>less</em> rounded development of the child (or
                    children) concerned. Hence, the pronouncement made by the court in <em>CX v CY</em> that a joint (or no) custody order would
                    henceforth be <em>the norm rather than the exception</em>.
                    We could not agree more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     And, as that very decision emphasises –
                    relying on the excellent scholarly (yet wholly practical) contributions by
                    Associate Professor Debbie Ong Siew Ling (in “Parents and Custody
                    Orders – A New Approach” [1999] Sing JLS 205 (at 222-223) and
                    “Making No Custody Order: <em>Re G (Guardianship of an
                        Infant)</em>” [2003] Sing JLS 583 (at 586) –
                    <em>exceptional situations or circumstances</em> in which a
                    joint (or no) custody order would <em>not</em> be made
                    involve <em>extreme situations or circumstances</em>,
                    including the infliction of physical, sexual or emotional abuse on the child (or
                    children) concerned by the parent who is therefore denied custody <em>as well as</em> situations “where the relationship of
                    the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after the avenues of
                    mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of co-operation is
                    harmful to the child” (see <em>CX v CY</em> at [38],
                    also quoted above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>). In fairness to
                    the wife, it was, we assume, this last-mentioned exception that Mr Koh was
                    also referring to on her behalf in the context of the present appeal. However,
                    there was, in our view, <em>no</em> evidence on the record
                    to indicate that – apart from the animosity that existed between the wife
                    and the husband – there was that <em>extreme</em>
                    kind of negative situation that would actually result in <em>harm
                        to the children</em>. It would, with respect, constitute a leap in
                    logic to infer from the animosity between the parties that <em>extreme</em> situation that constitutes an <em>exception</em> to the general rule that joint (or no) custody orders
                    should be made to give effect to the concept of joint parenting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Having regard to the circumstances in the
                    present case, we reversed the order of the court below and ordered that there be
                        <em>joint</em> custody between the parties of the
                    children, although care and control would continue to reside in the wife. It
                    followed that sub-paragraph (b) of the order of court below (reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>) ought to be deleted, and we so
                    ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We also ordered that, if there is an
                    application to vary the orders relating to custody in the future, then <em>the views of the children</em> are to be taken into account
                    – if appropriate, by way of <em>interviews with the judge
                        concerned</em>. In our view, this is both logical and commonsensical
                    (especially where the parents are at odds with each other to begin with, as is
                    the case in the present appeal) - provided that the children
                    are mature enough to convey their views <em>independently</em>. There is no particular age when this may be
                    appropriate as different children may mature sufficiently at
                    different ages. In this case, there was no issue of consultation not being
                    appropriate as the children were sixteen, thirteen and nine years of age,
                    respectively. Such an approach is also consistent with – and, indeed,
                    embodied in – the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”), in particular, s 125(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed,
                        the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to
                        this, the court shall have regard —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) to the wishes of the parents of the child; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) <em>to the wishes of the child, where he or she is
                                of an age to express an independent opinion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We do acknowledge, however, that there is
                    always the possible concern that a child (or children) might be primed or
                    coached prior to the interview with the judge. We should think that parties
                    would be sufficiently wise not to indulge in such a practice and that their
                    counsel would advise them against such action as well. Further, we are confident
                    that the judge concerned would, given the very nature of his or her vocation, be
                    sufficiently astute to discern whether or not the child concerned has in fact
                    been so primed or coached. In any event, to allow such a possibility to
                        <em>completely</em> negate the implementation of such a
                    helpful as well as practical procedure would be to throw out the legal baby
                    together with the bathwater. Having said that, such a procedure must not itself
                    become ossified by being applied in a mechanical fashion. The possible fact
                    situations are too numerous for general guidelines to be laid down. All that can
                    be said is the judge concerned should – absent exceptional circumstances
                    – be not only aware of this procedure but (more importantly) also be
                    prepared to implement it as this would facilitate his or her
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Returning to the facts of the present appeal,
                    we would strongly encourage both husband and wife to put aside their acrimony
                    and co-operate in a manner that would yield positive results in so far as the
                    nurturing of their children is concerned. After all, as s 125(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) states, the court must have regard to their
                    views as well. But such views must not be coloured by any personal prejudice and
                    animosity toward each other. In the nature of things, this is probably easier
                    said than done. However, we trust and hope that, ultimately, the
                    children’s best welfare will encourage them to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We turn now to the issue relating to the
                    division of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     An important issue arose as to whether or not
                    the amount of $395,000, which had been contributed by the husband’s mother
                    after the marriage had broken down, ought to be included in the pool of
                    matrimonial assets. Mr Koh conceded, correctly in our view, that that
                    amount ought not to be included. We should record here our appreciation for his
                    candour which ensured that no unnecessary court time was wasted on this
                    particular issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The other important issue in this appeal was
                    whether or not the Judge had erred in ordering that the pool of matrimonial
                    assets be divided in the ratio of 57 per cent in favour of the husband and
                    43 per cent in favour of the wife. This represented, in point of fact, the
                    direct financial contributions of both the parties. Counsel for the husband,
                    Mr Chelva R Rajah SC, submitted before this court that this
                    was an eminently just result as the husband’s <em>indirect</em> contributions were <em>equal
                        to</em> those of the wife. He pointed, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to the fact that, during the initial years of their
                    marriage at least, the wife had worked extended hours and was in fact earning
                    more than the husband. However, this was not, in our view, conclusive of the
                    relative amount of indirect contributions of the parties themselves. In many
                    families nowadays, both spouses hold full-time jobs. However, it does not
                    necessarily follow, in our view, that a wife who holds a full-time job
                    necessarily contributes less to the family by way of indirect contributions.
                    Neither does it necessarily follow that the husband would contribute more in
                    this context. Indeed, any number of situations is possible. For example,
                        <em>both</em> spouses might contribute little –
                    or nothing – by way of indirect contributions, resulting, as a whole, in a
                    poorer quality of life for the family as a whole. It is also true that a working
                    wife might even contribute <em>more</em> by way of indirect
                    contributions by <em>stretching</em> her time and efforts
                    on behalf of the family even after a long day at work. This is not to state that
                    the husband’s indirect contributions might not also be substantial as
                    well. However, all this demonstrates the point made earlier in this paragraph to
                    the effect that much will depend, in the final analysis, on the precise facts
                    before the court. In this appeal, however, we were not persuaded that the
                    husband had contributed at least as much as the wife by way of indirect
                    contributions. In fairness, the evidence does demonstrate that he was a loving
                    and caring father and we hope that this will continue to be the case in the
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At this juncture, we should emphasise that
                    direct and indirect contributions are to be given due weight and no single
                    factor is determinative of the outcome. This is clear from the wording of
                    Section 112(1) of the Act, which places no emphasis on any particular type
                    of contribution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Power of court to order division of matrimonial
                            assets</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">112. — (1) The court shall have the power, when granting or
                        subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or
                        nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any
                        matrimonial assets or the sale of any asset and the division between the
                        parties of the proceeds of any such asset in such proportions as the court
                        thinks just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the decision of this court in <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<em>NK v NL</em>”), it was held (at [23]-[27]) that a spouse’s direct
                    financial contribution must be only one among many factors for consideration,
                    and due weight had to be given to all indirect contributions of the other party
                    which by their nature are not reducible to monetary terms. It was also held in
                        <em>NK v NL</em> that the traditional approach of
                    considering the amount of direct contributions as a starting point for division
                    should be rejected as it may not be a particularly accurate reflection of the
                    amount of actual contributions by either party to the marriage (at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Ultimately, the court is directed to take a
                    “broad-brush” approach to the process of division of matrimonial
                    assets by resisting the “temptation to lapse into a minute scrutiny of
                    the conduct and efforts of both spouses, which may be objectionable in
                    disadvantaging the spouse whose efforts are difficult to evaluate in financial
                    terms” (see <em>NK v NL</em> at [28]). Therefore, on
                    our facts and having regard to all the available evidence, we were of the view
                    that a just and equitable division of the pool of matrimonial assets would be by
                    way of equal division to both husband and wife, respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the circumstances, and taking into account
                    the fact that the $395,000 given by the husband’s mother ought to be
                    excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets as well as the value of matrimonial
                    assets currently held by the wife, the husband was to pay the wife a total of
                    $119,353.36, being 50 per cent of the remaining value of matrimonial assets
                    that are to be distributed to the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the circumstances, the appeal in
                    CA 94/2010 was allowed in part and the appeal in CA 96/2010 was
                    allowed in its entirety. We were also of the view that, having regard to all the
                    circumstances, each party ought to bear his or her own costs both here as well
                    as in the court below. The usual consequential orders were to
                apply.</p>
