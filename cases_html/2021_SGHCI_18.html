Shortly before the <span class="font-italic">Costs Judgment</span>, Kiri applied for an order that Longsheng, a non-party to SIC/S 4/2017 (“Suit 4”) be made jointly and severally liable for the costs payable by Senda.  We deal with that application in this judgment. We adopt all abbreviations and terms of reference used in the <span class="font-italic">Costs Judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Having considered the parties’ written submissions on Kiri’s application, we decline to make Longsheng jointly and severally liable with Senda for Kiri’s costs in Suit 4. Principally, we are not persuaded that Longsheng had such a close connection with Suit 4 or that it had caused the incurring of costs by Kiri in Suit 4, so as to justify making the order which Kiri seeks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Longsheng was not a party to Suit 4. The test for whether a non-party should be made liable for costs has been set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">DB</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2010] 3 SLR 542 (“<span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span>”). Although the appeal in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees </span>originated from the High Court and not the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”), the parties have not contested the applicability of the principles in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span> to these proceedings. Order 110 r 46(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) provides that the SICC may order costs to be paid by a “person who is not a party” to the proceedings.  But the provision does not stipulate a test that is different from that in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span>. We will therefore apply the principles in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 As <span class="font-italic">per</span> <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span> (at [27]), the question is whether the present case is “exceptional”, such that in all the circumstances it will be just to order Longsheng to bear costs. “Exceptional” refers to cases falling outside the ordinary situation in which parties pursue or defend claims for their <span class="font-italic">own</span> benefit and at their <span class="font-italic">own</span> expense. In determining this question, the Court of Appeal singled out two factors which should normally be present to justify ordering a non-party to bear the costs of a given set of proceedings. The first, noted at [30], is that there must be a “close connection” between the non-party and the proceedings, and the second, noted at [35], is that the non-party must have caused the costs to be incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Turning to the first factor, we find that this has not been established by Kiri. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span> clarified (at [30]) that the non-party must either have funded or controlled <span class="font-italic">the proceedings</span> with the intention of ultimately deriving a benefit from it. As pointed out by Senda, Kiri has not pointed to any evidence showing that Longsheng funded or controlled the proceedings in Suit 4, let alone did so for its own benefit. Instead, in its written submissions, Kiri mainly relied on the acts of oppression which were the subject of our decision in the <span class="font-italic">Main Judgment</span>. These acts of oppression were acts by Longsheng that preceded Suit 4. They do not establish that Longsheng funded or controlled Suit 4.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Kiri referred to the fact that Senda did not call any independent witnesses and two of Senda’s witnesses were affiliated with Longsheng. But this is hardly indicative of anything. It is common for company personnel and officers to be affiliated with various entities within the same group. There is nothing “exceptional” in this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Longsheng may have had <span class="font-italic">control</span> over Senda, as its wholly owned subsidiary. However, that is insufficient to meet the threshold in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span>. It is control or funding of proceedings that is relevant. If ownership of subsidiaries was sufficient, then in every litigation involving a group of companies, the parent company or companies would be liable for costs orders made against subsidiaries. This cannot be right. As noted in <span class="font-italic">SIC College of Business and Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo Poh </span><span class="font-italic">Siah and others</span> [2016] 2 SLR 118 (“<span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>”) at [91], the fact that a non-party is the sole shareholder of a company does not automatically mean that the corporate veil will be lifted and that costs will be ordered against the sole shareholder.  For the corporate veil to be pierced, there must be evidence of fraud or unconscionable conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 A case involving egregious conduct was <span class="font-italic">Montpelier Business Reorganisation Ltd v Armitage Jones LLP and others </span>[2017] EWHC 2273 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Montpelier</span>”). Kiri relied <span class="font-italic">Montpelier </span>for the proposition that where a non-party has funded, stood to benefit from, and controlled a claim, it should be treated as the “real party” to the litigation and be made liable for costs. However, in <span class="font-italic">Montpelier</span>, the claimant company, which was ordered to pay costs after its claims had been dismissed, was insolvent well before the costs order was made. The concern in that case was that litigation had been advanced on behalf of an insolvent company by its shareholder. In other words, the controlling non-party had been using what was essentially an empty vessel to conduct “risk-free litigation”. In our opinion, <span class="font-italic">Montpelier </span>exemplifies a paradigm example of unconscionable conduct in bringing litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The present case is distinguishable. Unlike the claimant in <span class="font-italic">Montpelier</span>, Senda is not insolvent. There is thus no issue of Longsheng using an insolvent company to conduct risk-free litigation. Further, Senda was not the claimant in Suit 4. It was defending a claim brought by Kiri. This is a far cry from <span class="font-italic">Montpelier</span> where the controlling non-party had selected an insolvent company to <span class="font-italic">advance </span><span class="font-italic">a claim</span> against several defendants. We add that while Suit 4 had been heard alongside SIC/S 3/2017 (“Suit 3”), which was initiated by Senda, Suit 3 was disposed of separately.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 This brings us to the second factor in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span>: causation. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">SIC College </span>at [103] and [106], since Senda was the defendant in this case, “different considerations may apply”. One consideration is whether the defence was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, an example being where the company is advised that there is no realistic defence to the claim, yet its controllers choose to move forward with the trial out of spite, or for the sole purpose of causing the plaintiff to incur costs. In other words, where a non-party directs a company unreasonably to prolong proceedings, thereby causing the plaintiff to incur costs, the non-party may be made liable for such costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In our opinion, Senda’s conduct of its defence did not cross this threshold. The issues in Suit 4 were complicated and multi-faceted. They involved significant controversy, as evidenced by the various judgments that have been rendered to date. Kiri did not succeed on every issue that arose. Accordingly, it cannot be said that Senda defended the claims by Kiri in bad faith. Senda did not unreasonably cause Kiri to incur further costs in the litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Finally, Kiri submits that, there being “serious doubts as to whether Senda will pay any costs order made against it”, Longsheng should be made liable for the costs. In support, Kiri has cited <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span> at [42] and [49]. While we agree that this is a relevant factor, there is no evidence that Senda will be unable to pay the costs order. As alleged evidence of Senda’s inability to pay, Kiri has highlighted a statement by Senda to the effect that it will not have the funds to comply with the buy-out order made in the <span class="font-italic">Main Judgment</span>. However, as pointed out by Senda in response, the quantum of the buy-out order, at almost half a billion US dollars, far eclipses the quantum of costs awarded against Senda. Accordingly, it would be speculative to infer from Senda’s concession, <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the buy-out order, that it will be unable to fulfil the costs order in the <span class="font-italic">Costs Judgment</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 For those reasons, we reject Kiri’s application. We note that Kiri’s application raises questions over this court’s jurisdiction over Longsheng as a non-party and concerns regarding due process (for instance, the necessity of giving Longsheng an opportunity to respond to Kiri’s application). However, given our dismissal of Kiri’s application, there is no need to make further observations on these matters.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kannan Ramesh<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Roger Giles<br/>International Judge</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Anselmo Reyes<br/>International Judge </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Dinesh Dhillon, Lim Dao Kai, Margaret Joan Ling, Dhivya Naidu and Serene Chee Yi Wen (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Toh Kian Sing SC, Cheng Wai Yuen, Mark, Soh Yu Xian, Priscilla and Lim Wee Teck, Darren (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the first defendant; <br/>Teng Po Yew (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

Kiri alleged that Senda had acted oppressively with regard to their joint venture vehicle, DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">DyStar</span>”). Senda was a subsidiary of Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Longsheng</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2 The Singapore International Commercial Court (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the SICC</span>”) found that there was oppression by Senda and ordered that Senda purchase Kiri’s minority interest in DyStar at a value of US$481.6m (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the Buy-Out Order</span>”). Then, on 8 December 2021, the SICC released its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Kiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another </span>[2021] SGHC(I) 16 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs Judgment</span>”), where it ordered Senda to pay Kiri costs and disbursements totalling S$8,111,642.11. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3 Shortly before the release of the <span class="font-italic">Costs Judgment</span>, Kiri wrote to court requesting that Longsheng be made jointly and severally liable for the costs payable by Senda. Senda opposed this application. The issue was reserved for consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The SICC’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">4 The SICC found that the present case was not an exceptional one, and therefore declined to make Longsheng liable for the costs payable by Senda.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">5 Kiri was unable to point to any evidence showing that Longsheng funded or controlled the proceedings for its own benefit. Longsheng having control over Senda was insufficient reason for the court to lift the corporate veil and order costs against it. There had to be evidence of fraud or unconscionable conduct. For example, in the case of <span class="font-italic">Montpelier Business Reorganisation Ltd v Armitage Jones LLP and others </span>[2017] EWHC 2273, the plaintiff was an insolvent company that had been used by its parent company to bring “risk-free” litigation against several defendants. This was not the case here: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">5</span>] to [<span class="font-weight-bold">9</span>].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">6 Further, Senda, as the defendant, did not unreasonably prolong proceedings and cause Kiri to incur further costs. The proceedings were complicated and multi-faceted, and involved significant controversy. Kiri did not succeed on every issue and thus it could not be said that Senda had defended Kiri’s claims in bad faith: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">10</span>] to [<span class="font-weight-bold">11</span>].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">7 Finally, there was no evidence that Senda would be unable to pay the costs order.
