The previous attempt was an application to set aside the service of the writ in Indonesia, which I dismissed – see <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</span> [2015] 4 SLR 625. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On this occasion, the defendants mounted two separate applications: one to strike out the action and another to stay the action in favour of Indonesia. I heard both applications together. At the end of the hearing, I found no merit in the striking out application and dismissed it summarily. The striking out application was based solely on the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The doctrine is a judicial expression of the need to prevent abuse of the court’s process and is typically invoked to prevent a litigant from raising new points and arguments which should have been raised in earlier proceedings. Here, the 1st and 2nd defendants sought to apply the doctrine on the premise that the plaintiff’s causes of action in the Singapore action, which are separate and distinct from the causes of action in the Indonesian proceedings, should and ought to have been raised in the earlier Indonesian insolvency proceedings involving the 1st defendant. Quite apart from the fact that the Indonesian proceedings do not involve the 2nd defendant, I found, for reasons elaborated at [74]–[84] below, that there was no basis for applying the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 However, the stay application, grounded on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, merited closer examination following an observation I made at the end of the hearing. There are three seemingly distinct claims in the Singapore action. Both parties approached the stay application on the basis that all three claims should either proceed in Singapore or be stayed in favour of Indonesia. Initially, no specific submission was made for a halfway house of staying some but not all the three claims. When this scenario was raised as a possible outcome of the stay application, counsel for the 1st and 2nd defendants, Mr Rakesh Kirpalani, understandably seized on this option to submit that the claims against the 1st and 2nd defendants in respect of the inter-company loans should be stayed even if the court is not minded to stay the restructuring transactions. This decision will therefore examine, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the circumstances in which a court may exercise its discretion to stay some but not all the claims in a Singapore action in favour of another jurisdiction, as well as the propriety of doing so. It will also consider whether, in determining the natural forum for the adjudication of the claim, the difficulties in the enforcement of any judgment of the Singapore action in the foreign jurisdiction would be a relevant factor to determine or to displace the natural forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I start with an outline of the background facts common to both applications (at [5]–[40]). I then give my grounds for dismissing the striking-out application since it has raised some interesting legal points (at [41]–[85]) followed by my decision on the stay application (at [86]–[131]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The parties to this action are all part of the Humpuss group of companies.

</div>
</div> It would hence be undesirable for the plaintiff’s claims to be prevented from proceeding by reason of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Have the liquidators’ claims been included in the Composition Plan? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Central to the defendants’ case for striking out the plaintiff’s claims in the Singapore proceedings on the basis of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>is the <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> that the <span class="font-italic">subject matter</span> of the liquidators’ claims have all been included in the composition plan. On this assumption, they argue that the liquidators ought to have raised their claims as objections in the PKPU proceedings which they were aware of. To do so now would be re-opening the Homologation Judgment which is final and binding on all the 1st defendant’s creditors, including the plaintiff. That, they submit, would be an abuse of process.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I should state upfront that this assumption on which their entire case is based suffers from many evidential and logical gaps. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The claim against the 1st defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The defendants’ submission that the liquidators should be precluded from claiming the inter-company loan from the plaintiff to the 1st defendant because it has been admitted into the composition plan was beset by a number of fundamental problems.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The amount Teldar supposedly agreed to be liable for was a staggering US$140m. Yet there is no evidence at all of the actual agreement by which such a huge debt was transferred. If this transaction is legitimate, it would be reasonable to expect that Teldar would not assume such a huge liability without some formal documentation. Furthermore, there is no apparent reason why it would do so. Teldar is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands whose relationship to the 1st defendant is not known. The exact breakdown of the US$140.9m shown in the Homologation Judgment as owing to Teldar was not provided. Therefore, without the actual guarantee agreement in evidence, it is simply not possible to verify (a) the legitimacy of the alleged transfer; (b) that the sum of US$140m is owing by the 1st defendant to Teldar, as alleged; and (c) that the sum included the inter-company loan which was originally due and owing by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff. This is merely a bald assertion by the 1st defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Further, for Teldar to have taken on the 1st defendant’s liability to the plaintiff for the inter-company loan, the plaintiff must have given its consent. The defendants have not explained how and when the plaintiff did so.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The next point is the most crucial. Even assuming Teldar had validly taken over the 1st defendant’s liability for the inter-company loan, Teldar would only become a creditor of the 1st defendant for the inter-company loan amount of US$72,608,916 if it had <span class="font-italic">first</span> repaid that loan to the plaintiff. Only then would it be entitled to look to the 1st defendant for recovery. That is precisely what the 1st defendant’s 2012 Annual Report suggests: Teldar would be entitled to the sum of US$140m when the “debts to [the plaintiff] and its subsidiaries [had] been fully paid by Teldar” (see [26] above). Quite plainly, that has not occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Finally, the defendants’ own case is that Teldar has since assigned the inter-company loan of US$72,608,916 to Athens. But their ostensible reason for striking out this claim is that it has already been included in the composition plan. However, if Athens has taken over that debt, then it is indeed curious that Athens has brought a civil claim against the 1st defendant for the same debt in the South Jakarta District Court instead of seeking to vary the Homologation Judgment to be included as a creditor in the composition plan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The claims against the 2nd defendant </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As for the liquidators’ claims against the 2nd defendant, the 1st defendant asserts that it took over the restructuring transactions from the 2nd defendant and, on that basis, invited me to find that these claims have been included in the composition plan. There are two cumulative difficulties with this submission.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, the effect of Mr Borrelli’s letter under Indonesian law may be disputed. But since it is written in English, there is no question of its plain meaning being lost in translation. On the face of that letter, it is immediately apparent that there is no mention of the plaintiff consenting to the 1st defendant taking over the debts owed by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiff. Mr Borrelli’s letter was not even addressed to the 1st or 2nd defendants, but to the Indonesian Stock Exchange instead. It was written for the specific purpose of highlighting the plaintiff’s claims against the 1st defendant to the Stock Exchange. It would require a somewhat contrived reading of the letter to yield the effect sought by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Second, even if the plaintiff had consented to the 1st defendant taking over the 2nd defendant’s liability for the restructuring transactions, it would not mean they had consented to the 1st defendant’s quantification of liability at US$37,809,996 to take into account two sets of payments made on the plaintiff’s behalf (see [34]–[35] above). There is no hint in Mr Borrelli’s letter of the sum having been reduced in this way. The other piece of evidence is the 1st defendant’s letter to the administrator but there is no evidence that the plaintiff was even aware of this letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As for the inter-company loan to the 2nd defendant, the defendants have no evidence to show that it was in reality one and the same with the debt owed by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiff under the restructuring transactions. They do not dispute that the loan was recorded in the plaintiff’s financial statements for 2009, as pleaded in the statement of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 From the above analysis, it would appear that there are significant difficulties in the defendants’ assertion that the liquidators’ claims against them have been included in the composition plan. That having been said, I will now turn to explain why I found, in any event, that the requirements for the application of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were not satisfied to strike out the liquidators’ claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The defendants’ case on <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>was unusual, to say the least. It will be necessary to first examine the rationale and scope of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> as it applies to domestic judgments before examining its application and effect on foreign judgments and, in particular, foreign judgments rendered by an insolvency court such as the PKPU proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Res judicata and domestic judgments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I start with <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> as it applies to domestic judgments. The general principles have been set out authoritatively by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1104 (“<span class="font-italic">TT</span>”). The plea of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> encompasses three distinct but interrelated legal principles: cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, and the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, also known as the defence of abuse of process (see <span class="font-italic">TT</span> at [98]). Cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel apply to preclude a party from raising a claim or issue which has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in previous litigation between the same parties (see <span class="font-italic">TT</span> at [99]–[100]). The extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> goes further by precluding a party from raising claims or issues which, though not brought before the court, and therefore not specifically determined, nevertheless ought properly to have been raised and argued. The extended doctrine thus extends cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel to such claims or issues which were “so clearly part of the subject matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started in respect of them” (see <span class="font-italic">Greenhalgh</span><span class="font-italic"> v Mallard</span> [1947] 2 All ER 255 at 257, cited in <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit and another appeal </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 53 (“<span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong</span>”) at [23]). The same public interest underlies cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, and the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>: “that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter” (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm) </span>[2002] 2 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”) at 31; see also <span class="font-italic">TT</span> at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The origin of the extended doctrine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The origin of the extended doctrine is commonly said to be <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 3 Hare 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Henderson</span>”). It is worth noting that <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> was concerned with the preclusive effect of proceedings in a foreign court. Two brothers, Bethel and Jordan, were partners in their father’s business. Jordan died intestate in Newfoundland and his widow sued Bethel in Newfoundland for, among other things, sums of money he had failed to account for under the partnership. Judgment was granted in her favour. Bethel tried to resist enforcement of the judgment in England by arguing that it was actually Jordan (and, upon his death, his widow) who owed him money under the partnership. Bethel did not raise this argument in Newfoundland. This prompted Sir James Wigram VC to observe (at 115): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span> applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which [the] parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Thus stated, the extended doctrine applies only if a matter has been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and “the same parties” raise matters which “properly belonged to the subject of litigation”. Subsequent cases, however, have added two refinements to the doctrine: there is no requirement that the parties must be the same or that “every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation” must have been brought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No requirement of identity of parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The requirement of identity of parties has since been dispensed with. Indeed, it is precisely because the parties are different that cause of action and issue estoppels are generally inapplicable and resort must be had, as a result, to the extended doctrine. Thus, a plaintiff may be precluded from suing a defendant who should have been sued in previous proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Seddon Hancock and others (Third Parties)</span> [1999] 1 WLR 1482 at 1491). Conversely, a defendant may invoke the extended doctrine to preclude a plaintiff who could have brought a claim against him in previous proceedings, but who did not, from now doing so (see <span class="font-italic">Kwa</span><span class="font-italic"> Ban Cheong v Kuah Boon Sek and others</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 664 at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thus, the liquidators’ submission that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>could not bar the plaintiff from suing the 2nd defendant solely on the premise that the PKPU proceedings were only in respect of the 1st defendant must be rejected.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Matters which properly belonged to the subject of litigation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 There is also no requirement that every point which could have been taken in previous proceedings should have been, so as to render the raising of it in subsequent proceedings necessarily an abuse of process. That would be, as Lord Bingham observed in <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at 31, to adopt too dogmatic an approach. Rather, the court is to determine whether there is an abuse by looking at all the circumstances of the case. The court may consider, in particular, whether the later proceedings constitute a collateral attack upon the previous decision, whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation, whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not, and whether there are other special circumstances that might justify allowing the case to proceed (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Teck </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”) at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</span> [2013] 3 SLR 710 at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendants argued that the liquidators’ present claims constitute a collateral attack on the Homologation Judgment and therefore an abuse of process.

</div>. I have expressed my serious reservations as to whether this submission is borne out by the facts before me (see [47]–[56] above). Approaching this submission as a matter of law, however, where a foreign judgment is concerned, recognition of the foreign judgment is the process by which one determines that a matter has been the subject of litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. I now elaborate on that requirement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The extended doctrine of res judicata and foreign judgments </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Recognition of foreign judgments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Recognition of a foreign judgment is a necessary prerequisite for it to be <span class="font-italic">res</span><span class="font-italic"> judicata</span> before our courts either through cause of action or issue estoppel or by virtue of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span>. In <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2013] 1 SLR 1254, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J noted at [155]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With regard to foreign judgments (as opposed to locally obtained judgments), as was the case here, the operation of the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process is qualified. A prerequisite is that the foreign judgment must be recognised within the forum of Singapore for it to have any effect (see Peter Barnett, Res Judicata, Estoppel, and Foreign Judgments (Oxford University Press, 2001) at p 24).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">George Wei JC made a similar observation in <span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span><span class="font-italic"> Trikamdas Mody and another v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1161 (“<span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span>”) at [135]: “the principle that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applies to foreign judgments <span class="font-italic">entitled to recognition</span> is well established and undoubtedly part of Singapore law” (emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Recognition is the process by which the domestic court determines that a foreign judgment is entitled to have legal effect in the forum. It is therefore a prelude to enforcement, which is the primary but not only purpose for which recognition can be sought. A party who relies on a foreign judgment to prevent the matters therein from being re-litigated by the other party is essentially aiming “to establish a negative proposition and seeks that recognition alone be accorded to that judgment. There is no question of enforcement” (see <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws </span>(Lord Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>”) at para 14-005). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The tests for recognition and for enforcement are the same. Recognition in this case is governed by the common law rule because the statutory schemes in Singapore for recognising and enforcing foreign judgments only apply to judgments from specified countries, which do not include Indonesia. The common law rule is that a foreign judgment will be recognised if (a) it is the final and conclusive judgment of a court which, (b) according to the private international law of Singapore, had jurisdiction to grant that judgment, and (c) if there is no defence to its recognition (see <span class="font-italic">Giant Light Metal Technology (</span><span class="font-italic">Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 545 (“<span class="font-italic">Aksa</span>”) at [13] and [17]). I will examine each of these requirements in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Final and conclusive judgment </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As a starting point, the foreign judgment must be final and conclusive on the merits. The party who seeks to rely on the judgment has the burden of proving that it is final (see <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss </span><span class="font-italic">Stiftung v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd (No 2) </span>[1967] 1 AC 853<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span>”) at 936, 949, and 971). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There are two aspects to finality. First, the judgment must be conclusive of the merits of the case. This means that the decision is one which cannot be varied, re-opened or set aside <span class="font-italic">by the court that</span><span class="font-italic"> delivered it</span> (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Bunga Melati 5” </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 at [81]). This aspect of finality applies whether <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span> is being invoked in respect of a domestic or a foreign judgment (see KR Handley, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata</span> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) at para 5.01). A domestic or foreign judgment is no less final merely because it is subject to an appeal or a stay of execution (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [28] and <span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span> at [142]–[144]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In addition, where a foreign judgment is concerned, finality is to be assessed by asking whether the foreign court rendering the judgment would itself regard it as final and conclusive. Thus, Lord Reid stated in <span class="font-italic">Carl-Zeiss </span>that it would “verge on absurdity” to regard as conclusive something in a foreign judgment which the foreign court would not regard as conclusive (at 919). In <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Bunga Melati 5”</span> at [86], the Court of Appeal endorsed Lord Reid’s statement as a “principled approach” which applies in Singapore.

Rule 43 of <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>, at p 690, lists four grounds of jurisdiction: presence in the foreign country, filing a claim or counterclaim before the foreign court, voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court by appearing in the proceedings, and agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction before the commencement of proceedings.

The approach to default judgments is instructive here. A foreign judgment obtained in default of one party’s appearance may be regarded as final and conclusive even though it may be set aside by the same court which rendered it. As long as the judgment is intended to be final, it remains final until a defendant takes steps to set it aside (see <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span> at para 14-023). In this case, the experts both point out that the Homologation Judgment can be annulled if the debtor fails to comply with the terms of the composition plan.

</div> Annulment depends on an event in the future which may or may not happen. As long as the Homologation Judgment was intended to be final and conclusive, the possibility of annulment will not change that; if it has in fact been annulled, the judgment is obviously no longer final and conclusive.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 That brings me to the liquidators’ second argument, which I accept: the Homologation Judgment is not intended to be final and conclusive because it can be varied. The general rule is that “[a] foreign judgment which is liable to be abrogated or varied by the court which pronounced it is not a final judgment” (see <span class="font-italic">Dicey </span>at para 14-023). Here, there are two ways in which the Homologation Judgment can be varied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 First, the defendants’ expert on Indonesian law suggested (and the plaintiff’s expert agreed) that the plaintiff could file a miscellaneous charge to include a debt omitted from the composition plan. While the experts on Indonesian law did not offer a definition of a “miscellaneous charge”, it appears to be an application filed by a creditor requesting the court to determine issues arising out of a Homologation Judgment. In this case, the defendants argued that the plaintiff could seek repayment of the US$72,608,916 inter-company loan it claims in the present Singapore action by filing a miscellaneous charge to ask for an order for such payment.

</div> Besides suggesting that the Homologation Judgment is capable of being varied, I note in passing that this submission by the defendants’ expert on Indonesian law implies that the US$72,608,916 inter-company loan had not in fact been admitted into the composition plan by Teldar’s assumption of liability, as the defendants contended. This is entirely in line with my observations at [47] to [56] above on the defendants’ significant difficulties in establishing, at this stage, that the <span class="font-italic">subject matter</span> of the liquidators’ claims have been included in the composition plan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, the plaintiff’s expert on Indonesian law added that the judgment could also be varied if the admitted debts were fraudulent conveyances.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Rubin</span>, the majority of the UK Supreme Court found that a judgment based on fraudulent conveyances given in a New York court could not be enforced in England against a party who did not appear and who therefore could not be treated as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court (see [168]–[169], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Collins and [189], <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Mance). Similarly, the plaintiff here cannot be taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Indonesian court simply because it had the chance of proving its debts there. This point was also addressed in Adrian Briggs, <span class="font-italic">Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments </span>(Informa Law, 6th Ed, 2015) at para 7.81, where the author opined that if an absentee plaintiff is <span class="font-italic">simply </span><span class="font-italic">notified of</span> but plays no part in the proceedings, it is impossible to say that the foreign court could be jurisdictionally competent to bind him by its judgment or order. The resulting judgment would not preclude the claimant from commencing a claim in another forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The mere fact that the 1st defendant had unilaterally included the plaintiff as a creditor in the composition plan cannot in itself constitute the plaintiff’s submission to the jurisdiction of the Indonesian court for the purposes of the Homologation Judgment.

It is at the court’s discretion whether or not to grant a stay of proceedings on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. It will do so only if there is some other available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate for the trial of the action. The inquiry proceeds in two stages. At the first stage, the defendant bears the legal burden of showing that there is an available and more appropriate forum. The factors which may indicate the appropriateness of any available forum include the relative convenience and expense of trial in a forum, the substantive law applicable to the dispute, and the residence or place of business of the parties. The party asserting any one factor bears the evidential burden of proving it, and the weight to be attached to each factor will depend on the facts of each case. If, upon considering all the factors, the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances in which justice requires that a stay be refused. The legal burden shifts to the plaintiff, at this second stage of the inquiry, to prove that such special circumstances exist (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span>”) at [13]–[15]; <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 (“<span class="font-italic">Dresdner</span>”) at [26]; <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO</span>”) at [38]–[40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It should be recalled that the plaintiff seeks the following reliefs in the Singapore proceedings: (a) the recovery of an inter-company loan of US$72,608,916 from the 1st defendant; (b) the recovery of an inter-company loan of US$39,542,815 from the 2nd defendant; and (c) the setting aside of the restructuring transactions as against the 2nd defendant. These are three distinct claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Up to the hearing of this application, the defendants did not make any distinction between any of the claims in aid of its stay application. There was no specific submission that, even if the court should be minded to deny the stay in respect of the restructuring transactions, it should nonetheless stay the claims in respect of the inter-company loans against the 1st and 2nd defendants. The defendants only adopted this argument belatedly in response to a point I had raised in the course of the hearing. Nonetheless, I will first examine whether a court can grant a stay in respect of some of the plaintiff’s claims but not the others. I will refer to this as a “partial stay”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Partial stay of proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 There are very few decisions where a partial stay has been granted on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>grounds. There are two permutations for a partial stay in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 First, one might stay a claim as against one defendant but not the other defendants. A distinction may be drawn, for example, between the 1st defendant who is already a party in the PKPU proceedings and the 2nd defendant who is not. A stay against one of several defendants is permissible if the actions against them are not closely related and there is no possibility of inconsistent decisions being reached by courts in different jurisdictions. <span class="font-italic">Itochu Steel Asia Pte Ltd v C V </span><span class="font-italic">Wira Mustika Indah and others</span> [1999] SGHC 321 (“<span class="font-italic">Itochu</span>”) is a case where such a partial stay was granted. A Singapore-incorporated company brought an action against an Indonesian partnership and two Indonesian citizens. The action against the 1st and 3rd defendants was based on dishonoured bills of exchange. The 2nd defendant guaranteed the liability of the 3rd defendant. Only the 2nd defendant applied to stay the action on the basis of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. Amarjeet Singh JC granted the stay, finding that the action on the guarantees had the closest and most real connection with Indonesia (at [21]). The plaintiff had objected to the stay on the premise that the action against the 2nd and 3rd defendants would be more effectively disposed of together in Singapore. In response Singh JC observed that the evidence required to establish liability against the 2nd and 3rd defendants was very different; in addition, the validity of the guarantees under Indonesian law was in issue, which made it more appropriate that the action against the 2nd defendant be resolved by an Indonesian court (at [22]–[24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 If the case against the defendants raises the same issues and relies on the same evidence, to grant a partial stay would allow the defendants to be sued separately in different jurisdictions, with the undesirable prospect of inconsistent judicial decisions. In such circumstances, it would not be in the interests of justice to grant a partial stay. This was made clear in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 104 (“<span class="font-italic">Hutan</span>”) at [24] to [26]. In that case, the plaintiff sued a company to recover two debts, and the president of the company who had acted as guarantor for both debts. The guarantor did not challenge the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. The company, relying on the <span class="font-italic">Itochu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>decision, sought a stay of the action against it. Having explained the undesirability of two actions raising common issues being tried in two jurisdictions, the Court of Appeal found that, notwithstanding that the guarantees were governed by Indonesian law, the ends of justice would be better served if both actions were disposed of in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I should mention that the partial stay in <span class="font-italic">Itochu</span> was brought about <span class="font-italic">as a result </span>of the nature of stay application which was <span class="font-italic">only</span> filed by the 2nd defendant. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Hutan</span>, the court was confronted with a partial stay because the other defendant did not contest the jurisdiction of the Singapore court to hear the case. Here, the circumstances are slightly different because <span class="font-italic">both</span> defendants are seeking, in the alternative, a partial stay for some but not all the claims as against <span class="font-italic">both</span> defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Another form of partial stay is to stay one of the claims against a defendant, but not the rest. This is the sort of partial stay which both defendants are seeking in the alternative. This may be appropriate where the forum is eminently the natural forum for deciding on one claim but not the others. As an example <span class="font-italic">Hyslop</span><span class="font-italic"> v Society of Lloyd’s</span> (1992) 6 PRNZ 204 comes close, though strictly speaking it was about a stay based on an exclusive jurisdiction clause rather than <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. A member of Lloyd’s sought the cancellation of registration documents by which she became a member. Her claims were based on misrepresentation, negligence, breach of implied terms, and under two New Zealand statutes: the Fair Trading Act 1986 and the Securities Act 1978. English law was the governing law and there was an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of England. The defendants sought a stay of all proceedings. Holland J declined to stay the claims based on the New Zealand statutes. This was because the statutes were designed for the protection of the New Zealand public, the factual and legal matters relevant to the statutory causes of action concerned New Zealand, and the objection based on the exclusive jurisdiction clause had little force in the face of a provision in the statutes which precluded contracting out of them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Further afield, jurisprudence from the United States supports the possibility of a partial stay by which a court retains jurisdiction over some claims and chooses to stay the rest on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. An oft-cited case in point is <span class="font-italic">Scottish Air International</span><span class="font-italic"> Inc v British Caledonian Group, PLC</span>, 81 F 3d 1224 (2nd Cir 1996) which illustrates the propriety of granting a partial stay if the forum is eminently the appropriate forum for one claim but not others. In that case, the plaintiffs’ claim for contempt of court in breaching a court order embodying a settlement agreement was heard by the New York Court. Another claim for the reinstatement of directors to the board of directors of a Scottish airline was dismissed on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> grounds. The New York Court took the view that a court in the United Kingdom would be the natural forum for that action. In the court’s view, because the claim for breaching a court order could “by definition” only be decided by a New York Court, it was not inappropriate to decide that claim while dismissing the rest of the claim on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> (at 1235). They had earlier found that the UK was the more appropriate forum for the latter claim because it had a “more substantial interest” in the board composition of a Scottish corporation (at 1234). In the court’s view, the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> should be flexible enough to accommodate a partial stay. Otherwise, the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis could be skewed “by joining claims that lack merit” (at 1235). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In my view, a partial stay would be particularly relevant where claims pursuant to a forum’s statutory laws are brought alongside other claims. The possibility of a partial stay might discourage litigants from tacking on claims with no obvious connection to the forum to claims which do. However, as the cases of <span class="font-italic">Itochu</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hutan</span> have elucidated, the court must be alert to the degree of overlap between the claims. Any partial stay, whether as against one of multiple defendants or in respect of one of multiple claims, would be impermissible if there is a high degree of overlap in the claims leading to the possibility of inconsistent decisions by different courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the present case, the claims to recover the inter-company loans might appear to be distinct from the claim to set aside the restructuring transactions. Going by the statement of claim alone, there appears to be little if any overlap in the facts surrounding the three claims. In principle, it is open to me to stay the proceedings as regards one or more of the claims while declining to do so for the rest. I should mention that Mr Kirpalani’s submission is that I should stay the claims for recovery of the inter-company loans as against <span class="font-italic">both </span>the 1st and 2nd defendants even if I should decline to do so for the restructuring transactions. In other words, he treated the inter-company loans against the 1st and 2nd defendants <span class="font-italic">collectively</span>. He did not submit that I should treat each of the inter-company loan claims separately because they are against different defendants. Hence, I will first consider what the natural forum for the restructuring transactions is, before addressing my mind to the natural forum for the inter-company loan claims as a whole against both defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The restructuring transactions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In my judgment, the natural forum for the restructuring transactions must be Singapore. This is because, at the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, the connecting factors would point overwhelmingly in favour of Singapore. However, even if Indonesia is found to be the more appropriate forum at the first stage, at the second stage, the unavailability in the Indonesian court of the statutory remedies exclusive to our insolvency laws would constitute special reason to refuse a stay in any event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Attempts to stay claims for oppression of a minority shareholder under s 216 of the Companies Act have been rejected on a similar basis. In <span class="font-italic">Transtech</span><span class="font-italic"> Electronics Pte Ltd v Choe Jerry and others</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 1014, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held that the action was based on a Singapore statute which concerns a Singapore company subject to that statute. Even if the action could be brought in the foreign court, it would not be the most appropriate court to resolve a dispute which turned on the meaning and scope of a Singapore statute (at [19]). This point was amplified in <span class="font-italic">Fan </span><span class="font-italic">Heli v Zhang Shujing and others</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1457 by Aedit Abdullah JC, who noted that the “predisposition” should be to regard the Singapore court as the natural forum (at [26]). The s 216 claim is necessarily premised on events which take place between the shareholders of a Singaporean company. The law governing the affairs of the Singapore company would necessarily be Singapore law. Consequently, the “centre of gravity” of such a claim would be Singapore (at [25]). In any event, the unavailability of s 216 remedies in the foreign court would constitute grounds to refuse a stay under the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test (at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Similarly, since the plaintiff is a Singapore-incorporated company presently in liquidation in Singapore, and the setting aside of the restructuring transactions is sought under Singapore law, the connecting factors point overwhelmingly to Singapore as the natural forum. Furthermore, I agree with the liquidators that the rights to set aside the restructuring transactions are exclusive to the liquidators by the operation of Singapore’s insolvency laws.

</div> The plaintiff would be prejudiced if the action to set aside the restructuring transactions is stayed as the liquidators would not be able to pursue this remedy elsewhere. The defendants have not been able to establish that the claims based on the restructuring transactions could be brought in Indonesia.

</div> It would therefore be more satisfactory for the Indonesian courts to decide on matters engaging Indonesian law. I cannot agree. What is in issue is the effect of the plaintiff having entered into those agreements and not the enforcement of the agreements themselves. It is precisely because the agreements are accepted as having been executed that the liquidators now seek to avoid those transactions on the plaintiff’s behalf based on the grounds available under our insolvency laws. Nor is the plaintiff seeking to enforce the restructuring transactions as against the 2nd defendant. Therefore, what is material is the law applicable to the claim to set aside the restructuring transactions, and not the law applicable to the transactions themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Neither of the defendants’ arguments detracts from my conclusion that the natural forum for the restructuring transactions is Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The inter-company loans </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I turn to the inter-company loans.

I did not find the presentation of the factors in this manner particularly helpful. In the words of Chao Hick Tin JA in <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Holdrich Investment Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1007 at [19], the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… not an exercise in comparing the sheer number of connecting factors which point to this or that jurisdiction.

It suffices that the defendant can show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably relevant to its defence (see <span class="font-italic">JIO</span> at [67]). The importance of the location and compellability of witnesses increases if the main disputes revolve around questions of fact (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> at [19]).

Chao Hick Tin JA observed at [40] that “documentary evidence is, in this modern age, easily transportable between jurisdictions” and that any inconvenience occasioned by having to transport them could be addressed “by an appropriate order for costs and disbursements”.

The liquidators submit that, because there are no known written agreements for the inter-company loans, the governing law of the loans must be the law with which the loans have the closest and most real connection. That law is Singapore law because the loans were extended by the plaintiff, a Singapore company, and were reflected in its unaudited accounts.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Before forming a view of the governing law of any claim, the court must characterise “the true issue or issues thrown up by the claim and defence” (see <span class="font-italic">Macmillan </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3)</span> [1996] WLR 387 at 407). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 As mentioned earlier, the identity of the natural forum has to be assessed with reference to the anticipated defence.

Those explanations are relevant in determining the applicable law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 As regards the inter-company loan to the 2nd defendant, the defendants say that there was no such inter-company loan because the amount of the loan was in fact what was owed to the plaintiff under the restructuring transactions. The defendants do not dispute that the plaintiff’s accounts do record a loan extended to the 2nd defendant. In my view, whether the inter-company loan to the 2nd defendant existed or not is a factual inquiry and does not raise issues requiring the application of the governing law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 That leaves the inter-company loan to the 1st defendant.

</div> They submit that the governing law of the Teldar guarantee is Indonesian law and the liquidators have not disputed that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It may not be entirely clear whether the law applicable to the dispute over the 1st defendant’s inter-company loan is Singapore or Indonesian law. Despite that, I do not think the fact that the court in Singapore may have to address questions of Indonesian law should weigh significantly against its hearing the case. Where the competing fora have domestic laws which are substantially similar, or if the legal issues in a case are straightforward, the identity of the governing law will be a factor of little significance (see <span class="font-italic">OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua </span><span class="font-italic">Choon</span> [2010] 4 SLR 904 at [33]). For a start, I am not satisfied that there is any material difference between the laws of the two jurisdictions on this issue. Both experts are <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> that under Indonesian law, the obligations under a contract cannot be assigned without the express consent of the other party; if such consent is given, it would then constitute a novation of the original contract.

</div> That is essentially the law in Singapore as well (see <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd</span> [1994] 1 AC 85 at 103, cited in <span class="font-italic">Cassa</span><span class="font-italic"> di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza SpA v Rals International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 79 at [102]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Furthermore, the resolution of this legal issue is fairly straightforward. The 1st defendant does not dispute the existence of the inter-company loan from the plaintiff. The legal issue is confined to the inquiry whether the plaintiff had consented to Teldar taking over the 1st defendant’s liability for the inter-company loan. This will in turn require an examination of what amounts to consent under the applicable law. Even if Indonesian law is the applicable law, there is no basis for me to conclude that this will necessarily be a complex legal issue given the paucity of evidence on the Teldar guarantee agreement and the absence of any suggestion to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 On the whole, I find that the governing law is a neutral connecting factor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Residence or place of business of parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The plaintiff is incorporated in Singapore while the defendants are incorporated in Indonesia.

Accordingly, the liquidators would still have to commence fresh proceedings in Indonesia to obtain a remedy against the defendants in Indonesia.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 This cannot be a factor in favour of the Indonesian court as a forum to hear the disputes. In <span class="font-italic">Bayerische</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Kong Kok Keong and another action</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 485 (“<span class="font-italic">Bayerische</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank</span>”), the argument was that even if a bank was successful in its claim for monies under credit facilities granted to the defendant, it would still have to enforce the judgment in Malaysia where the defendant was resident; it would therefore be more convenient to deal with liability and enforcement in the same forum. Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) considered that it was the bank’s choice where it wanted to sue; it was not for the defendant to complain that enforcement would be more difficult (at [13]). More pertinent to the present case is <span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Ming Chuang v Singapore Airlines Ltd (Civil Aeronautics Administration, third party)</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 409 where, as in this case, there was some evidence that SIA would not be able to enforce a judgment of a Singapore court in Taiwan and would have to sue afresh (at [53]). Woo Bih Li J echoed Lee JC’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Bayerische</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank</span>: any difficulty in enforcement was a problem for the plaintiff and not for a defendant to raise in a stay application (at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I agree entirely with these observations. In any event, it should not be assumed that the liquidators will only enforce any judgment it obtains here in Indonesia. The defendants assumed the liquidators might have good reason to do so since both defendants’ assets are located in Indonesia. However, the choice of forum for the purposes of enforcement is the liquidators’ prerogative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Further, I should add that it is intuitively wrong for a defendant to raise enforcement difficulties in aid of any stay application. As noted by the British Columbia Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Imagis</span><span class="font-italic"> Technologies Inc v Red Herring Communications Inc</span>, 2003 BCSC 366 at [36], such a submission suggests that the defendants do not intend to discharge any judgment that may be obtained in this jurisdiction. Otherwise, this factor would be irrelevant. It is obvious though that no weight can be given to a party’s assertion that it will not respect a judgment of this court. Hence, I agree with the observation at [37] that difficulties in enforcement cannot <span class="font-italic">per se</span> be a factor in an application for a stay of proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the natural forum for the inter-company loans</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The location of witnesses points towards Singapore. While the applicable law may point either way, that would be of no consequence to the stay application given my finding that there is no material difference in the laws of the two jurisdictions on the relevant issues. None of the factors point towards Indonesia as the more appropriate forum for the adjudication of the inter-company loans against the 1st and 2nd defendants. The defendants have therefore not discharged their burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In addition, there is considerable overlap between the plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd defendant for the restructuring loans and the inter-company loan which makes it more expedient if both disputes are heard in the same forum. Taking the 2nd defendant’s case at its highest, its defence is that the inter-company loan does not exist independent of the restructuring transactions. It would hence be incongruous for the 2nd defendant to apply to stay <span class="font-italic">this claim</span> in favour of Indonesia when its defence is that there is no such claim. The defendants’ case for partial stay is that both loans should be examined collectively. Since the defendants have treated the inter-company loans collectively, it stands to reason that both should be heard in the same forum, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Singapore court. Given my finding that the claim for the inter-company loan against the 2nd defendant should not be stayed, on that ground alone, the submission for a partial stay in respect of both inter-company loans should be rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In any event, it is the defendants’ case that the 1st defendant has taken over the 2nd defendant’s liability for the restructuring transactions. It follows that the presence of the 1st defendant will be required to determine the identity of the party who is liable to the plaintiff for the restructuring transactions. That being the case, it would make eminent sense for the claim against the 1st defendant for the inter-company loan to be heard in Singapore as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In the circumstances, for the reasons set out above, it would not be appropriate to grant a partial stay in respect of the claims for the inter-company loans. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the stay application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In the result, I dismiss the stay application in its entirety with costs which I fix at $6,000 inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Steven Chong</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judge<br/></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">David Chan and Tan Aik Thong (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Rakesh Kirpalani Gopal, Allen Lye and Wong Su Ann (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the first and second defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
