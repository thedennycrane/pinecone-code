This included for example, categorising the subcontractor’s claims into binding subcontracts already entered into, contingent subcontracts with varying degrees of obligation to proceed to a binding subcontract and those where only indicative prices and terms had been explored, and settling them accordingly. Counsel for both parties should be commended for their very practical and commercial approach to resolving and narrowing the issues between their clients. They managed to settle a number of issues.

</div> But the Contractor cannot recover any more for lost profits for uncompleted work.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In response, the Defendant made two submissions. First, the Defendant submitted that cl 31.4(2) does not provide for the Contractor’s rights following termination under cl 31.4(1), but merely sets out the SO’s duties upon such termination. In this regard, the Defendant argued as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, termination under cl 31.4(1) is equivalent to “a total act of prevention” which amounts to a repudiation of the contract. Therefore, termination under cl 31.4(1) triggers the Contractor’s right at common law to recover for loss of profits for uncompleted work.

In this regard, the Defendant argued as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, termination under cl 31.4(1) is an act of prevention (see [30(a)] above).

</div> The Plaintiff also rebutted the Defendant’s argument that cl 31.4(2) could not have been intended to limit the Contractor’s right to recover for loss of profits, by arguing that cl 31.4(2) provided for fair compensation for the Contractor.

It contains four sub-clauses. Clause 31.1 to 31.3 address the situation of termination upon the Contractor’s default. By contrast, cl 31.4 allows the Employer to terminate the Contractor’s employment without the latter’s default. Clause 31.4 comprises two limbs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under cl 31.4(1), an employer (“the Employer”) has the right to terminate the Contractor’s employment by giving the Contractor a written Notice of Termination. The Contractor is then under an obligation to immediately vacate the construction site, remove all equipment and labour from the site and surrender possession of the site to the Employer. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under cl 31.4(2), the SO is under an obligation to certify the amounts payable to the Contractor in respect of the heads of claim in cl 31.4(2)(a) and (b). Moreover, cl 31.4(2) expressly states that the certified amounts “<span class="font-italic">shall be paid by the Employer</span> less any sums previously paid or due to or recoverable by the Employer from the Contractor” [emphasis added]. Thus, cl 31.4(2) imposes a duty on the Employer to pay the certified sums to the Contractor (subject to deductions for sums owing to the Employer).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Clause 31.4 is a “termination for convenience” clause (also known as a convenience clause). Such clauses grant the Employer the power to terminate the contract even if the Contractor is not in breach or default of the contract: see Nicholas Dennys QC, Mark Raeside QC and Robert Clay, <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Hudson</span><span class="font-italic">’s</span>”) at para 8-033. Such a clause is by no means unique. Similar clauses can be found in cl 32(1) of the Singapore Institute of Architects’ Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract) (9th Ed, September 2010) (“the SIA Conditions”) and cl 30.1 of the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore Design and Build Conditions of Contract (3rd Ed, October 2010) (“the REDAS D&amp;B Conditions”). I discuss cl 32(1) of the SIA Conditions and cl 30.1 of the REDAS D&amp;B Conditions at [64] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my judgment, cl 31.4(2) exhaustively provides for the sums which the Contractor is entitled to recover upon a proper termination under cl 31.4(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, as explained at [35(b)] above, cl 31.4(2) imposes a duty on the Employer to pay the certified sums to the Contractor. This duty correlates to the Contractor’s right to receive the said sums. Thus, the Defendant’s submission that cl 31.4(2) merely provides for the SO’s duties, and not the Contractor’s entitlements, cannot be sustained. Clause 31.4(2) confers on the Contractor a right to payment in respect of the heads of claim in cl 31.4(2)(a) and (b) (subject to deductions for sums owed by the Contractor to the Employer).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Secondly, I do not accept the Defendant’s submission that, upon termination under cl 31.4(1), the Contractor obtains without more a right at common law to recover for loss of profits which cl 31.4(2) fails to oust. No such right arises. The Defendant submitted that the right arises on the basis that termination under cl 31.4(1) is akin to a “total act of prevention” in repudiation of the contract. This submission is without basis. In terminating the Contractor’s employment under cl 31.4(1), the Employer is exercising a contractual right. The mere exercise of a contractual right cannot constitute a breach of contract, let alone a repudiation of the contract. Thus, the Contractor does not acquire a right at common law to recover for loss of profits upon termination under cl 31.4(1). Moreover, in my judgment, even if such a right arises at common law, cl 31.4(1) is in sufficiently clear words to oust this right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 At this point, I make clear that I leave open the possibility that, in some cases, the Employer may commit a breach of contract in purporting to terminate the Contractor’s employment under cl 31.4(1). In the United States of America (“US”), where termination for convenience clauses are common in government contracts, the power to terminate is limited by a duty of good faith: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Krygoski Construction Company, Inc</span><span class="font-italic"> v United States</span> 94 F 3d 1537. Similarly, the Federal Court of Australia has recognised, albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>,that a termination for convenience clause would be subject to a duty of good faith: <span class="font-italic">GEC Marconi Systems Pty Limited v BHP Information Technology Pty Limited</span> [2003] FCA 50 at [753] (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Finn J). Such a duty may constrain the Employer from terminating the Contractor’s employment on certain grounds. Thus, it has been suggested that the Employer may not invoke a termination for convenience clause to take advantage of lower prices offered by another contractor: <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s</span> at para 8-034 and Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">The Singapore Public Sector Construction Contract</span><span class="font-italic">: Commentary on the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract (7th Edition)</span> (LexisNexis, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Chow</span>”) at para 31.83. If this is right, the Employer will breach the contract if the latter terminates the Contractor’s employment on such grounds. The Contractor may thus acquire a right to recover for loss of profits upon the wrongful termination. However, I note that the issue of whether the right to terminate is fettered is controversial. The English High Court has held that a termination for convenience clause was not subject to a duty of good faith: <span class="font-italic">TSG Building Services Plc v South Anglia Housing Limited</span> [2013] EWHC 1151 (TCC). Clause 15.5 of the 1999 <span class="font-italic">Fédération Internationale des Ingénieurs-Conseils</span> (“FIDIC”) Conditions of Contract for Construction for Building and Engineering Works Designed by the Employer: the Construction Contract (“the 1999 Red Book”), which usually operates in an international setting, removes this uncertainty by expressly providing that “[t]he Employer shall not terminate the Contract under this Sub-Clause in order to execute the Works himself or to arrange for the Works to be executed by another contractor”. As this question does not arise here, the possible implied duty of good faith on an employer when exercising its right under cl 31.4 must be left for another occasion when the issue can be fully argued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In sum, cl 31.4(2) provides for the sums which the Contractor is entitled to recover after (proper) termination under cl 31.4(1). Upon such termination, the Contractor does not acquire additional remedial rights at common law. The Defendant does not contend, nor is there any basis to contend, on these facts, that any other clause in the PSSCOC provides for the Contractor’s rights after termination under cl 31.4(1). It follows that cl 31.4(2) exhaustively sets out the sums which the Contractor is entitled to recover after (proper) termination under cl 31.4(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I now turn to the Defendant’s contention (see [30(a)] above) that, on these facts, the Plaintiff had concurrently repudiated the Main Contract. The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff had concurrently repudiated the Main Contract based on its instructions to the Defendant through the SO to suspend works and the Plaintiff’s freezing of debt repayments to its creditors (see [8] above). The Defendant then relies on the principle that, if a contract is terminated pursuant to a contractual termination clause, the innocent party may recover loss of bargain damages if there is a concurrent repudiation of the contract.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Submissions at paras 142 to 143.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Thus the Defendant submits that it may recover for loss of profits (as a component of loss of bargain damages) in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This submission is flawed. If the Plaintiff had repudiated the Main Contract, by suspending the works or by freezing payments to the Defendant, this would have occurred before the termination of the Defendant’s employment and not concurrently with it. Thus, even if the Plaintiff had repudiated the Main Contract, the present case would not fall within the ambit of the principle which the Defendant contends for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In any case, there is a more fundamental reason why that principle does not apply. It is limited to cases where one party has a right to terminate a contract on two grounds, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, under an express contractual provision and under the common law for repudiatory breach; and where both grounds are triggered by the same event. This is illustrated by <span class="font-italic">Lombard North Central Plc v Butterworth</span> [1987] QB 257 (“<span class="font-italic">Lombard</span>”), which the Defendant cites as authority for the principle. In <span class="font-italic">Lombard</span>, the defendant had leased equipment from the plaintiff and failed to make prompt payment of rentals. This gave rise to the plaintiff’s right to terminate the contract under a clause in the contract. Moreover, the court found that prompt payment was a condition such that the breach was a repudiation of the contract which gave rise to the plaintiff’s right to recover loss of bargain damages upon terminating the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 However, in this case, the Defendant is alleging that the Plaintiff, which held the contractual right of termination, had committed the repudiatory breach, thus giving rise to the Defendant’s right to terminate the Main Contract at common law. On this account there are two parties with the right to terminate, not one. Moreover, the alleged rights to terminate derive from different events. Plainly, the Defendant is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole in attempting to apply the principle in <span class="font-italic">Lombard</span> to the factual matrix which it has put forward. Therefore, I cannot accept the Defendant’s submission that it may recover for loss of profits due to a concurrent repudiation of the Main Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, I note that it is not the Defendant’s case that it is entitled to recover for loss of profits because it had accepted the alleged repudiation and terminated the Main Contract. Nor is there evidence before me to this effect. This is important because, even if the Plaintiff had repudiated the contract, the Defendant would only be entitled to recover for the loss caused by the breach if it had accepted the repudiation and terminated the Main Contract. Thus, if the breach was in failing to make prompt debt repayments (see [42] above), the Defendant could only recover for the unpaid sums and loss caused by the Plaintiff’s failure to pay those sums promptly, and not for loss of profits on the uncompleted work. In sum, even if the Plaintiff had repudiated the contract, and I find that it clearly had not, the Defendant did not acquire a right to recover for loss of profits. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Scope Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I now turn to the Scope Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As noted above, cl 31.4(2) provides for the Contractor to recover for “Loss and Expense suffered…in connection with or as a consequence of the termination”. Clause 1.1(q) expressly defines Loss and Expense (see [28] above) and it is specifically delineated by the words set out therein:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the direct relevant costs of labour, Plant [which is defined under cl 1.1(v) of the PSSCOC to mean machinery, apparatus and the like intended to form or forming part of the Permanent Works], materials or goods <span class="font-italic">actually incurred</span>;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) costs of an overhead nature <span class="font-italic">actually and necessarily incurred</span> on Site but in either case only in so far they would not otherwise have been incurred and which were not and should not have been provided for by the Contractor; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) 15% of any such costs, such 15% to be inclusive of and in lieu of any profits, head office or other administrative overheads, financing charges (including foreign exchange losses) and any other costs, loss or expense of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is noteworthy that both cl 1.1(q)(i) and (ii) above use words in the past tense, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “actually incurred” and “actually and necessarily incurred”. Additionally, under cl 1.1(q), Loss and Expense does not include loss of profits, but includes 15% of the costs under cl 1.1(q)(i) and (ii) “inclusive of and in lieu of any profits”. Thus, if the definition of Loss and Expense is governed by cl 1.1(q) alone, the Contractor is not entitled to directly recover for loss of profits under cl 31.4(2). Instead, the Contractor may recover a sum in lieu of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, loss of profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Defendant does not appear to dispute this reasoning. Rather, the Defendant argues that cl 22 expands cl 1.1(q)’s definition of Loss and Expense to include loss of profits such that the Contractor may recover for loss of profits under cl 31.4(2)(b). However, this argument is, with respect, without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50  First, I do not accept the Defendant’s submission that cl 22 supplements the definition of Loss and Expense in cl 1.1(q). Clause 22.1 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22.1<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Reasons for Loss and Expense</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Contractor shall be entitled<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>to recover as Loss and Expense sustained or incurred by him <span class="font-italic">and for which he would not be reimbursed by any other provision of the Contract</span>, all loss, expense, costs or damages of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as a result of</span> <span class="font-italic">the regular progress and/or completion of the Works or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any phase or part of the Works having been disrupted, prolonged or otherwise materially affected by</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in italics and bold italics added]<br/></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the following propositions regarding cl 22.1 are clear:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First and foremost, cl 22.1 stipulates that the loss and expense must arise as a result of the regular progress and/or completion of the Works or any phase or part of the Works having been disrupted, prolonged or otherwise materially affected by the events set out in cl 22.1. On its plain and ordinary meaning, cl 22.1 does not and cannot be referring to a termination of the whole of the Works as expressly provided for under cl 31.4. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, none of the events in cl 22.1(a) to (i) are applicable to the facts here. At first blush, it may be thought that the Defendant can try to rely on:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) cl 22.1(d): “the suspension by the Superintending Officer of any work for a cause which entitles the Contractor to recover Loss and Expense”; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) cl 22.1(i): “any act of prevention or breach of contract by the Employer not mentioned in this Clause”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">However, on a closer reading, the suspension of <span class="font-italic">any</span> work in cl 22.1(d) again cannot refer to a termination of the whole of the works (which is achieved by termination of the Contractor’s employment). Similarly, cl 22.1(i) only applies to an “act of prevention or breach of contract” which cannot arise in the event of a proper termination under an express contractual provision which confers such a right.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the Loss and Expense covered by cl 22.1 is the loss and expense suffered by the Contractor for which he cannot recover under any other provision of the PSSCOC. As noted above, cl 31.4 clearly gives the Contractor the entitlement to recover the sums provided for therein. Clause 22.1 therefore does not “expand” upon the remedies available to the Contractor upon a termination under cl 31.4.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, it is worth noting that the operative words “sustained” and “incurred” are in the past tense. Thus, cl 22.1 clearly refers to Loss and Expense that has already been sustained or incurred by the Contractor. It cannot apply to future Loss and Expense that has not been already “sustained” or “incurred”.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Furthermore, cl 22.2 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22.2 Sufficiency of Loss and Expense</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The Contractor shall not be entitled</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>to recover any loss, expense, costs or damage whatsoever resulting from any disruption, prolongation or other material effect to the regular progress or completion of the Works or any phase or part of the Works except in accordance with the express provisions of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Nothing in the wording of cl 22.2 indicates that cl 22 was intended to supplement the definition of Loss and Expense in cl 1.1(q). Rather, the two sub-clauses have the following functions. Clause 22.1 has the positive function of identifying cases in which the Contractor may recover for Loss and Expense. Clause 22.2 has the negative function of restricting that right of recovery to the cases identified in cl 22.1 and other provisions in the PSSCOC. Both sub-clauses play a complementary role in providing for the Contractor’s right to recover for Loss and Expense, which is the purpose of cl 22. Clause 22 does not expand the definition of Loss and Expense in cl 1.1(q). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I note that academic commentary also supports the view that cl 22 does not define Loss and Expense, but simply deals with the Contractor’s entitlement to recover for Loss and Expense. Clause 22 is discussed in Philip Chan Chuen Fye, <span class="font-italic">Public Sector Standard</span><span class="font-italic"> Conditions of Contract for Construction Works 2005: A Commentary</span> (LexisNexis, 2006) (“<span class="font-italic">Chan</span>”) at p 149 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Intention of the Clause</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This clause has two sub-clauses.

The expression “loss and expense” is consistent with damages under common law. It may include costs sustained by the Contractor before the termination, a reasonable profit on work which has been performed and other additional costs. <span class="font-italic">It is considered that the expression is also sufficiently expansive to include loss of contribution to the Contractor’s overheads and profit on any uncompleted parts of the works </span>and any other item of expenditure incurred by the Contractor as a consequence of the termination.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The last sentence in this extract is followed by a footnote, which states: “[t]hese principles are well described in a number of US cases; see for example <span class="font-italic">Pinckney v United States</span> 88 Fed Cl 490, 506 (2009)”. Insofar as this paragraph can be read as stating that Loss and Expense means loss and expense according to common law and that a claim for future profits can be made under cl 31.4(2)(b), I make four points in relation to this text.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, I think that this commentary must be read with care. <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> does not state that Loss and Expense means damages under common law. Neither has the learned author stated that Loss and Expense under cl 31.4 is to be “governed” by common law damages. Instead, he has chosen his words with care and said that it is<span class="font-italic"> consistent with</span> damages at common law. On my reading of this paragraph, <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> does not state that the phrase “Loss and Expense” in cl 31.4(2)(b) should be interpreted by reference to common law principles instead of the definition in cl 1.1(q). In my view, since cl 1.1(q) expressly defines Loss and Expense, it is neither necessary nor legitimate to apply the common law definition in interpreting cl 31.4(2)(b). The words in cl 1.1(q) are sufficiently clear to provide guidance as to what can and cannot be included in a claim for Loss and Expense under this sub-clause. In this regard, I note that no reference is made to the common law definition of loss and expense in the discussion of cl 31.4(2)(b) in <span class="font-italic">Chan</span> at p 208.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Secondly, it is also important to note that <span class="font-italic">Chow</span>, in the paragraph quoted at [57] above, correctly points out that the loss and expense being claimed must already have been “suffered”, and that costs or expenditure must have been “incurred”. I note that, in the commentary on cl 22.1 in <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> at para 22.4, the learned author contrasts the words “sustained or incurred”, which are used in cl 22.1, with the expression “incurs or is likely to incur”, which is found in cl 4.23 of the JCT Standard Form of Building Contract (2011 Ed) (“the JCT Standard Form”). <span class="font-italic">Chow </span>states that this latter provision, which is the counterpart provision to cl 22.1 in the JCT Standard Form, was considered to contemplate “past, present or prospective incurring of loss and expense”: see Stephen Furst QC and Sir Vivian Ramsey, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2012) at para 20-282. This militates against understanding the learned author as advocating that future loss of profit <span class="font-italic">per se</span> can be claimed.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Thirdly, in my view, the words which are italicised in the extract from <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> at para 31.79, at [57] above, indicate the learned author’s tentative view or, more likely, a view held by some in the industry. It should be noted that the phrase “it is considered that…” is used. The phrase “loss and expense” in building and construction law has considerable lineage and has been the subject of important court decisions like <span class="font-italic">Walter Li</span><span class="font-italic">lly and Company Ltd v Giles Patrick Cyril Mackay and DMW Developments Ltd</span> [2012] EWHC 1773 (TCC) (on what amounts to loss and expense under the JCT Standard Form). What <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> states at para 31.79 should, in all fairness, be read with what <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> states at para 1.29, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that “[i]n the context of the PSSCOC…Clause 1.1(q) confines the term [“Loss and Expense”] to three categories of claim items”, namely, the three items which are set out at [48] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Fourthly, the case which is cited in the footnote to para 31.79 does not support the view that, upon a termination for convenience, the Contractor may recover for loss of profit on uncompleted works (under US law). In <span class="font-italic">Pinckney</span><span class="font-italic"> v United States</span> 88 Fed Cl 490 <span class="font-italic">(“</span><span class="font-italic">Pinckney</span>”), the following is stated at 506:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Damages for a termination for convenience ‘‘are limited to costs incurred prior to termination, a reasonable profit <span class="font-italic">on work performed</span>, and certain additional costs associated with termination.’’ <span class="font-italic">Id</span>. However, <span class="font-italic">if plaintiff can demonstrate that the decision to terminate the contract was made in bad faith</span>, traditional breach of contract damages may be awarded.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 According to this passage, as a matter of US law, the Contractor may generally not recover for loss of profits on uncompleted work after the Employer exercises a termination for convenience clause. The Contractor may only recover for loss of profits if the clause is exercised in bad faith (see [40] above). Thus, <span class="font-italic">Pinckney</span> is not authority for the specific proposition that the Contractor may generally recover for loss of profits on uncompleted work. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Interpretation Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I conclude that, on a true interpretation of cl 31.4(2), the Contractor may not recover for loss of profits for uncompleted work upon termination under cl 31.4(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The position under cl 31.4 thus appears to diverge from that under cl 32(1) of the SIA Conditions and cl 30.1 of the REDAS D&amp;B Conditions. Both of these provisions expressly provide that the Contractor may recover for “loss of profits (if any) on any uncompleted parts of the Works”. At this point, I make the following four observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 First, the express wording of cl 31.4 read with cl 1.1(q) has led me to conclude that cl 31.4 does not provide for the Contractor to recover for loss of profits for uncompleted work. There is no room for me to reach the opposite conclusion given the clear meaning of the relevant provisions in the PSSCOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Secondly, cl 31.4 is not anomalous as a termination for convenience clause. Such clauses typically disallow the Contractor from recovering for loss of profits for uncompleted work, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s</span> at para 8-033:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The practical effect and purpose of [termination for convenience] clauses is that they usually permit recovery by the Contractor of contract or reasonable value, plus a reasonable profit on the work done prior to the termination, as well as settlement of Sub-contractor accounts and any removal or other expenses, <span class="font-italic">but disallow any claim for loss of profit on the remaining work</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">One commentator even identifies this limited entitlement to recover as one of three “main features” of termination for convenience clauses: Ruth Loveranes, “Termination for Convenience Clauses” (2012) 14 UNDALR 103 at p 105. Here, the history of these clauses is instructive. The story is vividly told in <span class="font-italic">Ronald A Torncello and Soledad Enterprises, Inc v United States</span> 681 F 2d 756 at 764 to 766 and <span class="font-italic">GL Christian and Associates v United States</span> 312 F 2d 418 at 426. Termination for convenience clauses date back to the time of the American Civil War, and evolved to enable the US federal government to terminate military procurement contracts without being liable for profits on unperformed work. The clauses were then used in American wartime contracts during World War I and II, and later spread into non-military contracts. It was vital to the clauses, when they first developed, that they prohibited recovery of anticipatory profits, to allow the government the flexibility to end wartime contracts. In this light, it is clear that cl 31.4, in disallowing recovery for loss of profits on uncompleted work, is not exceptional at all. It is a classic termination for convenience clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Thirdly, the history of termination for convenience clauses might suggest why the position under the PSSCOC differs from that under the SIA Conditions and the REDAS D&amp;B Conditions. The PSSCOC is the standard form contract used for public sector construction work in Singapore. The need for flexibility in construction contracts involving the public sector, which drove the development of termination for convenience clauses to begin with, may explain why cl 31.4, unlike its counterparts in the SIA Conditions and the REDAS D&amp;B Conditions, disallows recovery for loss of profits. I further note that the position under cl 31.4 appears to be similar to that under cl 15.5 of the 1999 Red Book, which gives the Employer the contractual right to terminate the contract at any time for its convenience (see [40] above). In Jeremy Glover and Simon Hughes, <span class="font-italic">Understanding the New FIDIC Red Book</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2006), the learned authors opine at para 15-029 that the most likely cause for the operation of this clause “will be an inability to fund and thereby finish the project”. It is of interest that these authors note that, upon termination under cl 15.5, the Contractor is entitled to payment in accordance with the <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> provisions of cl 19.6, but that cl 19.6 “does not refer to loss of profits”. The learned authors further note at para 1-033 that “cost”, a term used in cl 19.6, is defined in cl 1.1.4.3 as “all expenditure reasonably incurred (or to be incurred) by the Contractor, whether on or off the Site, including overhead and similar charges, <span class="font-italic">but doe</span><span class="font-italic">s not include profit</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Finally, the Defendant submits that it is unfair that the Contractor is not compensated for purchased equipment.

</div>
</div> I do not think the inadequacy or otherwise for compensation under cl 31.4(2) is an aid to the construction of a contractual provision. It should not be forgotten that these standard form contracts are all about the allocation of the risks in a building and construction project. Over time, the finer points on the risk allocation effected by the standard form are worked out by arbitration or the courts; and, periodically, the professional bodies responsible for these standard forms amend them if such amendments are deemed necessary by the industry. There is therefore little room for the Defendant’s submission that cl 31.4(2) should be construed in a way they contend as it otherwise provides for inadequate compensation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I now turn to the Entitlement Issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Entitlement Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Defendant submits that, even if cl 31.4(2) means that the Contractor may not recover for loss of profits, the Plaintiff may not rely on cl 31.4(2).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I turn first to requirement (a). In <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</span> [2007] 1 SLR 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”), Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) clarified the concept of finality. Menon JC held, at [28], that finality involves “a declaration or determination of a party’s liability and/or his rights or obligations leaving nothing else to be judicially determined”. Whether a judgment is final depends on the judge’s intention, which may be gleaned from the relevant document filed, the order made and the notes of evidence taken or arguments made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In this case, it is plain that the CA did not finally determine that the Defendant was entitled to recover for loss of profits under the Main Contract. That issue was simply not before the HC or the CA in the 2010 proceedings for the sanction of the Scheme (“the 2010 proceedings”). The following passages from <span class="font-italic">TT International (HC)</span>, at [96]–[99], attest to this point:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">96 Bearing in mind the general principles that the purpose of a scheme of arrangement under s 210 of the Companies Act is to obviate the need for messy and complicated proceedings with a view to obtaining the unanimous approval of the creditors to a variation of their rights, and that a minority of creditors should not be allowed to frustrate a beneficial scheme to the detriment of the majority, <span class="font-italic">I was minded to defer final determination of Ho Lee Construction’s claims against the Company until after the Scheme had obtained this court’s approval</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97 As I considered that the Scheme Manager had acted reasonably and with bona fides in rejecting part of Ho Lee Construction’s claim, the computation of the weight of Ho Lee Construction’s vote against the Scheme should not be impugned. Thus, <span class="font-italic">for the purposes of ascertaining whether the requisite majority had been obtained at the Meeting</span>, the Scheme Manager’s partial rejection of Ho Lee Construction’s claim could not be faulted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">99 It was Ho Lee Construction’s evidence that the determination of its claims for losses suffered, expenses incurred and lost profits would require the assistance and technical expertise of qualified professionals such as a Quantity Surveyor or Architect who are familiar with disputes in the construction industry. The Company’s position was that <span class="font-italic">there were other grounds on which to challenge Ho Lee Construction’s claim apart from its main failure to provide sufficient documentation to substantiate its proof of debt</span>. I was in no position to assess the strength of the parties’ contentions and a proper determination thereof required a full judicial or arbitral process. To my mind, this requirement militated against deferring the court’s approval of the Scheme to after a final non-appealable judicial determination of Ho Lee Construction’s claim against the Company. Such a judicial process may well prove to be protracted and would unduly delay the restructuring process of the Company via the Scheme to the detriment of the general body of Scheme Creditors. The more practical step forward was, in my judgment, to accept the Scheme Manager’s rejection of Ho Lee Construction’s claim for the purpose of ascertaining the requisite majority, <span class="font-italic">leaving it open to Ho Lee Construction to resort to the adjudication process to determine its final entitlement under the Scheme</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The narrow issue before the HC was whether the Scheme Manager had acted properly in rejecting the Defendant’s claims for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, loss of profits, for the purposes of a vote on the proposed Scheme. The HC clearly contemplated that the Defendant’s final entitlement under the Scheme would only be decided in subsequent court or arbitral proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Similarly, the CA did not determine that the Defendant was entitled to recover for loss of profits.

It must be made clear that even though the court may order (on appeal by a creditor) that his claim be admitted or rejected for the purpose of voting, this is in the nature of a “rough and ready” determination keeping in mind that a vote on the proposed scheme should not be delayed unnecessarily. <span class="font-italic">Such an order does not bar the creditor from going back to the court subsequently to seek determinative final adjudication of the same claim on its merits</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 At [113] of <span class="font-italic">TT International (CA)</span>, the CA stated that it “agreed with Ho Lee that its claim for loss of profits should have been admitted for a reasonable amount…”. The CA further ordered that the Defendant’s claim for loss of profits be valued by reference to certain objective criteria. The Defendant has relied on this passage to submit that the CA had finally determined that it was entitled to recover for loss of profits.

</div>
</div> In my view, however, the CA merely decided that the Defendant’s claim should be admitted for the narrow purpose of voting on the proposed Scheme. This is clear from [108] beyond peradventure. In Annexure II to <span class="font-italic">TT International (CA)</span>, the CA’s brief Grounds of Decision of 13 October 2010, the CA noted at [4] that its direction on how the loss of profits claim should be valued was made “to reduce the degree of uncertainty with respect to the quantum of Ho Lee’s claim for loss of profits to be admitted <span class="font-italic">for the limited purpose of voting as at an unsecured creditor at the Further Meeting</span>… [for the Scheme to be put to a re-vote]” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Thus, in my view, there was no final determination of the Defendant’s entitlement to recover for loss of profits prior to these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Moreover, there is no identity of subject matter between the present action and the 2010 proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>, Menon JC explained that the requirement of identity of subject matter comprises three strands. First, the prior decision “must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proceeding and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision must not have changed or should be incapable of change” (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [34]). Secondly, “the previous determination in question must have been fundamental and not merely collateral to the previous decision so that the decision could not stand without that determination” (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [35]). Thirdly, the issue which is said to be subject to an estoppel “should be shown in fact to have been raised and argued” (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [38]). In <span class="font-italic">Wing Joo Loong</span> at [167], the CA affirmed Menon JC’s account of the identity of subject matter requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The 2010 proceedings were concerned with the Defendant’s rights for the limited purposes of voting on the proposed Scheme, and not with the latter’s final entitlement to recover for loss of profits (see [74]–[76] above). Therefore, the CA decision does not traverse the same ground as the present proceedings. Moreover, the Defendant’s final entitlement to recover for loss and profits was not in fact raised and argued in the 2010 proceedings. Thus, there is no identity of subject matter between the present action and the CA proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In sum, requirements (a) and (d) (set out at [72] above) are not fulfilled. Therefore, the Plaintiffs are not issue estopped from relying on cl 31.4 to argue that the Defendant is not entitled to recover for loss of profits. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Abuse of Process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defence of abuse of process bars litigants from raising issues which should have been raised in earlier proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> [1843-60] All ER Rep 378 at 381–382, Wigram VC famously encapsulated this doctrine as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]here a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special-case, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but <span class="font-italic">to every point which </span><span class="font-italic">properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [53], Menon JC, as he then was, clarified the principles which should guide a court in determining whether there is an abuse of process as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In determining whether the ambient circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, the court should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but <span class="font-italic">should remain guided by</span> <span class="font-italic">the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant</span>. In the context of cases such as the present, the inquiry is directed not at the theoretical possibility that the issue raised in the later proceedings could conceivably have been taken in the earlier but rather at <span class="font-italic">whether, having regard to the substance and reality of the earlier action, it reasonably ought to have been</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The issue here is whether the Plaintiff ought reasonably to have argued that the Defendant could not recover for loss of profits under cl 31.4 during the 2010 proceedings. In my view, it was not reasonably incumbent on the Plaintiff to make that argument during the 2010 proceedings for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, put narrowly, the issue before the HC and the CA was whether the Scheme Manager had properly rejected the Defendant’s claims, including the loss of profits claim, in the Proof of Debt. The HC found that the Scheme Manager had acted properly because PWC had upheld the Scheme Manager’s rejection of the Defendant’s claims, on the grounds that the claims had not been properly substantiated (see <span class="font-italic">TT International (HC) </span>at [95], and [14] above). The CA disagreed, holding that the Scheme Manager had not acted on the correct principles as the latter had not made enquiries into the unsubstantiated claims in the Proof of Debt before rejecting it (see <span class="font-italic">TT International (CA)</span> at [106] and [113]). On this key issue, <span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>whether the Scheme Manager had acted properly in rejecting the Defendant’s claims in the Proof of Debt, without seeking further explanation and evidence from the Defendant, the Plaintiff’s argument on cl 31.4 is irrelevant. Thus, it was not reasonably incumbent on the Plaintiff to raise it during the HC and CA proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Secondly, considered more broadly, the 2010 proceedings involved the determination of the Defendant’s voting share for the purposes of voting on the proposed Scheme. Both the HC and the CA made clear that this did not impinge on the final determination of the Defendant’s claim for loss of profits (see <span class="font-italic">TT International (HC)</span> at [99] and <span class="font-italic">TT International (CA)</span> at [108], referred to at [74]–[75] above). On the contrary, the HC expressly contemplated that there were other grounds of challenge to the loss of profits claim which would be addressed upon final determination of that claim (see <span class="font-italic">TT International (HC) </span>at [99], quoted at [74] above). If indeed, as is the effect of the Defendant’s submissions, all creditors’ claims had to be valued, for voting purposes, according to a final adjudication before arbitral tribunals or the courts (including any appeals therefrom), few votes in favour of schemes could be held within a practical timeframe. In that light, I do not consider it “unduly oppressive” that the Defendant is met with the Plaintiff’s argument on cl 31.4 in these proceedings.  On the contrary, the balance of justice lies in favour of allowing the Plaintiff to advance its argument on cl 31.4 in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In sum, I find that it was not an abuse of process for the Plaintiff to raise its argument on cl 31.4 in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Waiver by Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff had lost its right to rely on cl 31.4 due to waiver by estoppel; the Defendant had detrimentally relied on the Plaintiff’s representation that it would not enforce its rights under cl 31.4:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Plaintiff had represented, by its conduct, that it was not challenging the Defendant’s right to recover for loss of profits.

</div> In terms of conduct prior to litigation, the Plaintiff had failed to appoint the SO to certify the Defendant’s claim and rejected the Proof of Debt on the sole ground of lack of substantiation. In terms of conduct during the CA proceedings, the Plaintiff had failed to raise and rely on cl 31.4.

</div> First, there must be a clear and unequivocal promise by the promisor that it will not enforce its strict legal rights. Secondly, the promisee must rely on the promise. Thirdly, the promisee must suffer detriment as a result of the reliance </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In respect of the first requirement, the Plaintiff did not make a clear and unequivocal promise that it would not enforce its rights under cl 31.4. Failing to appoint the SO to certify the Defendant’s claim and rejecting the Proof of Debt cannot be construed as such a promise. Moreover, as the CA proceedings did not concern the final determination of the Defendant’s claim (see [75]–[[77] and [85] above), the fact that the Plaintiff did not raise its arguments on cl 31.4 during those proceedings cannot be understood as a promise that it would not subsequently do so. Additionally, the Plaintiff’s engaging of an expert to assess the Defendant’s loss of profits claim in this action did not amount to a promise that it would not enforce its rights under cl 31.4. The Plaintiff required such an expert to advance its case on the Quantum Issue. Finally, the Plaintiff raised its argument on cl 31.4 on 22 March 2013,

The mere fact that the argument was not raised in pre-trial proceedings cannot constitute an unequivocal promise that it would not be subsequently advanced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Moreover, even if there was such a promise, the Defendant did not rely on it to its detriment. In respect of the costs which the Defendant has incurred, including those of engaging an expert for the loss of profits claim, the Defendant would have incurred these costs in any event, as it has taken the position that it is entitled to recover for loss of profits on the true construction of cl 31.4 and/or on the basis of common law damages. The Defendant also did not suffer any detriment in terms of its voting share at the meeting to approve the Scheme. The Scheme Manager ascribed a value of S$9.27 million to the Defendant’s claim for loss of profits (see [16] above), which would have exceeded a 15% margin on the admitted claim of approximately $22.77 million (see [13] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Thus, the elements of waiver by estoppel are not fulfilled.

</div> Secondly, even if the Plaintiff had breached cl 31.4, the Plaintiff was not relying on the breach but on its substantive rights under cl 31.4. Thus, the principle invoked by the Defendant did not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In my view, the Defendant’s submission is unfounded. It is unnecessary for me to decide whether the Plaintiff had breached cl 31.4, for I agree with the Plaintiff that the principle underlying the Defendant’s argument is inapplicable here. In <span class="font-italic">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 634, V K Rajah J (as he then was) summarised this principle, which is known as the “prevention principle”, at [52] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to invoke this principle it must be shown that the contractual right or benefit that a party is asserting or claiming is a <span class="font-italic">direct result of that party’s prior breach of contract</span>. The relevant breach, the factual consequences flowing from the breach and the advantage the contract breaker is seeking to raise must be identified. The principle seeks to <span class="font-italic">prevent the contract breaker from seeking an “advantage” arising from his default</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Even if the Plaintiff had breached cl 31.4, the benefit which the Plaintiff is claiming – the right to exclude or dispose of the Defendant’s claim for loss of profits – is not a “direct result” of that breach. Rather, the benefit flows from cl 31.4 itself which provides for the parties’ rights and duties upon termination under cl 31.4. Therefore, the prevention principle does not apply on these facts. Accordingly, the Defendant’s submission fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Entitlement Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Thus, I conclude that the Plaintiff is entitled to rely on cl 31.4(2) to dispose of the Defendant’s claim for loss of profits in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the reasons set out above, the Defendant is not entitled to recover for loss of profits on the uncompleted parts of the works.
