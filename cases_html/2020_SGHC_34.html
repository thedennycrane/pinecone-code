The District Judge (“DJ”) sentenced the Appellant to a total of eight weeks’ imprisonment. Pursuant to s 62(1)(i) of the GSTA, the Appellant was also ordered to pay a penalty of $433,090.56 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, three times the amount of GST overstated). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. I allowed his appeal in respect of the first to fourth charges, set aside his convictions and sentences, and acquitted him. However, I dismissed his appeal in respect of the fifth charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At all material times, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Appellant held 50% of the shares in the Company while his parents each held 25%; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Company was in the business of data communication services and development of other software.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Company was registered under the GSTA in 2002 and consequently became a “taxable person” under the GSTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As a taxable person under the GSTA, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Company was required to charge and collect GST on the taxable supplies of goods and services it made or rendered.

The IRAS conducted an audit on the Company’s GST F5 returns for the quarters ended 30 June 2006 to 30 September 2007. Subsequently, the audit extended to the returns for the quarters ended 31 December 2007 and 31 March 2008. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The IRAS found that the Company had made false entries in its GST F5 returns for the following five quarters: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the first quarter of 2006 (“2006 Q1”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the first quarter of 2007 (“2007 Q1”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the second quarter of 2007 (“2007 Q2”);  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the third quarter of 2007 (“2007 Q3”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the first quarter of 2008 (“2008 Q1”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In essence, the Company had either under-reported the output tax collected by it or over-reported the input tax incurred by it.

</div> There was no evidence that the Appellant was aware of the false entries in the GST F5 returns. The Prosecution argued that the Appellant would have been alerted to the fact that the GST refunds had been wrongly credited into the Company’s bank account because he had access to the Company’s bank account and the credited GST refunds far exceeded the account balances in the Company’s bank account at the relevant time. However, Tan’s investigations did not show that the Appellant was aware of the circumstances leading to the deposit of the GST refunds. The DJ rejected the Prosecution’s argument and declined to infer that the Appellant would have been in a position to know whether the Company qualified for the GST refunds that had been credited into the Company’s account.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As for the requirement to exercise the requisite diligence, the Appellant referred to the following and submitted that he had exercised all such diligence possible in the circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Appellant had resigned as a director due to disagreements with his mother and LCY over the management of the Company. He was not in charge of finance or filing the GST F5 returns in question. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) LCY, who was 12 years older than the Appellant and had considerable experience working in the finance industry, had taken over the finance function since December 2005.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Appellant’s role in the Company was that of a marketing and business development manager. Financial administration, including GST reporting, was under LCY’s charge. He was therefore not required to concern himself with the Company’s GST reporting. In this regard, the Appellant also referred to his difficult relationship with LCY.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Tan’s investigations showed that the Appellant was not in charge of the accounting department or the finance department. There was no evidence indicating that the Appellant’s role in the Company included any oversight over LCY’s work.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) There was no reason for the Appellant to be put on notice that anything was amiss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Appellant also relied on <span class="font-italic">Pillay v Public Prosecutor </span>[1965] 1 MLJ 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Pillay</span>”).<span class="font-italic"> </span>That case concerned ss 16A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 18(2) of Malaysia’s Employees Provident Fund Ordinance (“the Ordinance”) which, when read together, imposed liability on, among others, a manager of a company for non-payment of contributions by the company to its employees. The language used in s 18(2) of the Ordinance is similar to that found in s 74(1) GSTA. The Malaysian Court noted that the manager (who was the appellant in that case) was concerned only with sales and was not responsible for the payment of employees’ salaries. The Court thus held that “ … there could be no failure on the part of the appellant in showing any diligence in the doing of what he was not expected to concern himself”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The DJ rejected the Appellant’s submission. First, the DJ concluded that it was implausible that, as a member of the senior management of a small family-run company, the Appellant had no involvement or responsibility in the filing of the GST F5 returns.

</div>
</div> In the DJ’s view, it was hardly conceivable that there was such a clear demarcation of roles that the Appellant was completely uninvolved in the process of filing the GST F5 returns.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I disagreed with the DJ’s conclusion. The question was whether the Appellant had exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offences as he ought to have exercised. It was clear from s 74(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) GSTA that all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the Appellant’s functions in the Company, had to be considered in answering this question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, the DJ erred in finding that there was no demarcation of roles simply because the Company was a small family-run company. The mere fact that the Company was a small family-run company did not in and of itself mean that there was therefore no demarcation of roles. All the circumstances had to be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, the evidence established that it was more probable than not that the Appellant was not involved in, and had no oversight over, the preparation or filing of the GST F5 returns in question. I noted that the Appellant was part of the senior management of the Company and had been the declarant for several GST F5 returns filed between 2002 and 2005. However, that did not change the fact that he ceased to be involved in the GST filings after he had resigned as director in 2005 and that LCY took over the finance function and handled the Company’s accounts and GST filings. As the Appellant’s role in the Company did not require him to be responsible for the filing of the GST F5 returns, he could not be expected to exercise any supervision over LCY’s preparation and filing of the GST F5 returns. In this regard, I agreed with <span class="font-italic">Pillay</span>. It could not be said that the Appellant had failed to show the requisite diligence when the preparation and filing of the GST F5 returns were not matters that he was expected to concern himself with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, the DJ concluded that the Appellant had not been entirely truthful about his role in the filing of the GST F5 returns because of some inconsistencies between his testimony in court and the statements recorded from him.

</div> The inconsistencies related to whether (a) his role was to make purchases for the Company or only to make recommendations for such purchases, and (b) he had verified the figures prepared by LCY for some earlier GST F5 returns in which he was the declarant. In my view, the inconsistencies were not material to the question of whether the Appellant’s functions in the Company meant that he had failed to exercise such diligence as he ought to have exercised. The evidence was clear that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant’s functions in the Company did not include oversight of LCY’s work and did not require him to concern himself with LCY’s work. Further, the evidence did not show that the Appellant had any reason to suspect that there was something wrong with the GST F5 returns in question. In this regard, I noted as well that the DJ declined to infer that the Appellant was in a position to know whether the Company qualified for the GST refunds that were being credited to the Company’s account.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my view, there was no evidential basis for the DJ’s conclusion that the Appellant had some involvement in the filing of the GST F5 returns such that he could and ought to have done something more to prevent the commission of the offences in the first to fourth charges. On the contrary, the evidence showed that the Appellant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that he had satisfied the requirement to exercise the requisite diligence in s 74(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) GSTA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the circumstances, I set aside the convictions and acquitted the Appellant on the first to fourth charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fifth charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The fifth charge related to the GST F5 return for 2008 Q1, which the Appellant had prepared.

The version of s 79 that was in force at the time of the offence stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">79.</span> Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Company claimed, in its GST F5 return for 2008 Q1, that it had paid an input tax of $42,062.02 (see [10] above).

He argued that since the IRAS was already investigating the Company at the time when the GST F5 return was submitted, he would not have deliberately attempted to commit the same offence. The Appellant claimed that the mistakes were borne out of a genuine lack of understanding of the requirements for submitting GST claims.

</div> He found the Appellant’s claim to ignorance unconvincing as the Appellant had registered the Company under the GSTA and had previously been the declarant for several GST F5 returns filed between 2002 and 2005. Further, the DJ found that the disparity between the value of purchases claimed by the Company ($643,014.12) and the value verified by the IRAS ($12,371.65) was too large to be attributable to a mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I agreed with the DJ. It was unbelievable that the Appellant could have made such a huge mistake as to the value of purchases made by the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In any event, even if there had been a mistake, s 79 PC required the Appellant to have believed in good faith that the claims made in the GST F5 return were correct. In this regard, s 52 PC provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">52.</span> Nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 To avail himself of the s 79 defence, the Appellant therefore had to prove on a balance of probabilities that he had exercised due care and attention in making the claims in the GST F5 return (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Khee Wan Iris v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 723 at [17], [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The DJ found that the Appellant had failed to exercise the requisite diligence. I agreed with the DJ. Clearly, the Appellant had acted without due care and attention. He did not seek help from a professional when preparing the GST F5 return. As the DJ put it, it was not open to the Appellant “simply to file a GST F5 return willy-nilly, expecting IRAS to correct any mistakes”.
