The GRC scheme was implemented principally through the insertion of Article 39A to the Constitution and simultaneous amendments to the PEA. Under the scheme, the President may declare any constituency as a GRC and designate that constituency as one in which any election is to be held on the basis of a group of between three to six candidates. In addition, the President is to designate every GRC as either (a) a constituency where at least one of the candidates in every group must be a person belonging to the Malay community or (b) a constituency where at least one of the candidates in every group must be a person belonging to the Indian or other minority communities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 When Article 49(1) of the Constitution was enacted, there was no GRC scheme. When the seat in a single Member constituency (“SMC”) is vacated mid-term, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>during a government’s term of office, a by-election has to be held to fill the vacancy: Article 49(1) of the Constitution. The application of Article 49(1) in the case of an SMC is relatively straightforward; see, also, <span class="font-italic">Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>”). The question in the present case is whether a by-election must similarly be held when one of the seats in a GRC is vacated mid-term. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Leave required under O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 As a preliminary matter, under O 53 r 1 (1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules”), leave of the High Court is required for an application for a mandatory order. Leave will not be granted unless (a) the matter complained of is susceptible to judicial review; (b) the applicant has sufficient interest or standing in the matter; and (c) the applicant shows an arguable case or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>2017 Vol 2 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 53/1/6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I agree with the Applicant that the first requirement is clearly satisfied in this case. With respect to the second requirement, the Respondent accepts that the Applicant has sufficient interest as she is a voter in the MYT GRC and also a resident of Madam Halimah’s former ward. As for the third requirement of an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, I agreed with both parties to deal with this together with their submissions on the principal application since the submissions are the same. For reasons set out below, in my view, leave should not be given in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Applicant’s case for the mandatory orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Applicant seeks mandatory orders that the remaining MPs in the MYT GRC vacate their seats and that the Prime Minister advises the President to issue a writ of election. In her written submissions, the Applicant relied on three grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Article 49(1) of the Constitution requires the calling of a by-election in a GRC when the seat of an Elected MP has become vacant for any reason other than the dissolution of Parliament; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Article 39A(2) of the Constitution requires that a GRC be represented by an MP belonging to a minority community, until the dissolution of Parliament; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a by-election should be called because voters have a right to be represented by an Elected MP of their choice until the dissolution of Parliament under the Singapore Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first ground: Article 49(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 This first ground raises the question as to how Article 49(1) of the Constitution should be interpreted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Applicant’s case may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plain reading of Article 49(1) of the Constitution mandates a by-election to be called when one seat in a GRC falls vacant for any reason other than a dissolution of Parliament. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To enable the by-election for the MYT GRC to be held, the remaining MPs in the GRC must vacate their seats.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the outset, it is important to note that it is implicit in the Applicant’s case that a by-election in a GRC would be for the whole group as designated by the President in respect of that GRC (“the GRC Team”). In the case of the MYT GRC, this would comprise four candidates, at least one of whom must be from the Malay community. On this point, the Applicant is on common ground with the Respondent. This position must be correct. Under the law, it cannot be a by-election to fill just the one seat that has been vacated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 First, as the Respondent submits, Article 49(1) provides that the “vacancy shall be filled by election in the manner provided by or under any law relating to Parliamentary elections for the time being in force”. All elections (including by-elections) in any GRC shall be held on a basis of such number of candidates as designated for that constituency by the President: ss 27A(1) and (2) of the PEA. There is no law providing for the election of a single seat in a GRC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Second, the members of a GRC Team are required to be either members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group: Article 39A(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Constitution read with s 27A(3) of the PEA. The remaining MPs in the MYT GRC belong to the same political party. A by-election for just the single vacated seat in the present case would not be possible under the law unless it is limited to candidates belonging to the same political party as the remaining MPs in the MYT GRC. Obviously, such a limitation cannot be justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Respondent submits that Article 49(1) of the Constitution should be interpreted to require a by-election for a GRC only when <span class="font-italic">all</span> the Members of the GRC have vacated their seats. The Respondent’s alternative submission is that Article 49(1) does not apply to GRCs at all.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Principles of statutory interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The principles are not in dispute. Both the Applicant and the Respondent have referred me to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”). It is common ground that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the purposive approach applies to the Constitution which should be interpreted in a way that gives effect to the intent and will of Parliament; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the purposive interpretation of a legislative provision involves three steps:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) first, the court should ascertain possible interpretations of the provision, having regard to the text of the provision as well as the context of the provision within the written law as a whole. This is done by determining the ordinary meaning of the words, and could be aided by rules and canons of statutory construction;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) second, the court should ascertain the legislative purpose of the statute. Legislative purpose should ordinarily be gleaned from the text itself. Extraneous material may be considered in the situations set out under s 9A(2) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IA”); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) third, the court should compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purpose of the statute. An interpretation which furthered the purpose of the written text was to be preferred to one which did not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Possible interpretations of Article 49(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As stated at [19] above, the first step is to ascertain the possible interpretations of Article 49(1). It would be useful to set out Article 49(1) again:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">49.</span> — (1) Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant for any reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, the vacancy shall be filled by election in the manner provided by or under any law relating to Parliamentary elections for the time being in force.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The parties have submitted three different interpretations of Article 49(1) with respect to its application to GRCs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Article 49(1) requires the calling of a by-election for the whole GRC Team whenever a seat in the GRC becomes vacant mid-term (“the Applicant’s Interpretation”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Article 49(1) requires the calling of a by-election for the whole GRC Team only when all the seats in the GRC become vacant mid-term (“the Respondent’s Interpretation”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Article 49(1) applies only to SMCs and does not apply to GRCs (“the Respondent’s Alternative Interpretation”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Applicant’s Interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Applicant’s Interpretation faces an immediate hurdle. A by-election for the whole GRC Team cannot be held unless the remaining MPs in the MYT GRC vacate their seats. The Applicant herself acknowledges that the remaining MPs must first vacate their seats; one of the orders that she seeks is a mandatory order to that effect.  It is clear then that whether the Applicant’s Interpretation is a possible one depends on whether the remaining MPs can be compelled to vacate their seats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Article 46(2) of the Constitution provides the grounds upon which the seat of a Member is vacated. Article 46(2) states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">46.</span> — (2) The seat of a Member of Parliament shall become vacant —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if he ceases to be a citizen of Singapore;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if he ceases to be a member of, or is expelled or resigns from, the political party for which he stood in the election;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) if, by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker, he resigns his seat in Parliament;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) if during 2 consecutive months in each of which sittings of Parliament (or any committee of Parliament to which he has been appointed) are held, he is absent from all such sittings without having obtained from the Speaker before the termination of any such sitting permission to be or to remain absent therefrom;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) if he becomes subject to any of the disqualifications specified in Article 45;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) if he is expelled from Parliament in the exercise of its power of expulsion; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) if being a nominated Member, his term of service as such a Member expires.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Article 45 of the Constitution (referred to in (<span class="font-italic">e</span>) above) provides for various disqualifications (including <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>unsoundness of mind and bankruptcy). It is indisputable that the fact that a seat in a GRC has been vacated does not result in the remaining MPs being disqualified under Article 45.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 None of the grounds in Article 46(2) applies in the present case. There is therefore nothing in Article 46(2) that requires the remaining MPs in the MYT GRC to vacate their seats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Applicant submits that the remaining MPs in the MYT GRC must vacate their seats by resigning. However, the Applicant is unable to point to any provision upon which the remaining MPs can be compelled to resign. The Applicant’s argument is simply that because Article 49(1) has triggered a by-election in the present case, the remaining MPs must vacate their seats by resigning because otherwise a by-election cannot be held. In my view, this is a circuitous argument and is tantamount to saying that (a) the Applicant’s Interpretation depends on it being possible to compel the remaining MPs to resign, and (b) therefore, the remaining MPs must vacate their seats so that the Applicant’s Interpretation can succeed. Clearly, such an argument lacks logic and must fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Since there is no basis in law to compel the remaining MPs to resign, the Applicant’s Interpretation is simply unworkable. It is a rule of statutory construction that Parliament is presumed not to have intended an unworkable or impracticable result, so an interpretation that leads to such a result would not be regarded as a possible one: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [38]. In my judgment, it is unarguable that the Applicant’s Interpretation is not a possible interpretation of Article 49(1) for this reason.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Respondent’s Interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Respondent submits that the Respondent’s Interpretation is justified by applying either an updating construction or a rectifying construction of Article 49(1). The Respondent further submits that although the Respondent’s Interpretation may be strained, it is justified because it gives effect to Parliament’s express intent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Updating construction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 An updating construction is based on the presumption that the Legislature intends the court to apply to an ongoing statute a construction that continuously updates its wording to allow for changes since the statute was framed: <span class="font-italic">Comptroller of Income Tax v MT</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 688 (“<span class="font-italic">CIT</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [44], citing FAR Bennion, <span class="font-italic">Statutory Interpretation: A Code</span> (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 2002) at p 762. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">CIT</span>, the court was faced with two statutes which had a link to each other, but only one was later amended. The question before the court was whether an updating construction should be applied to the statute (which had not been amended) by importing the effect of the amendment that was made to the other statute. The court in <span class="font-italic">CIT </span>applied a three-stage analytical framework (at [46]-[47]) in determining whether an updating construction should be applied:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the first stage, the court ascertains the nature of the amendment effected in the first statute. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The inquiry at the second stage is directed at whether the amendment to the first statute gives rise to any ambiguity or uncertainty in the interpretation and application of the second statute as it stands, by reason of which, or for some other reason, there is potentially a need to apply an updating construction to the second statute. If the answer is in the negative, the inquiry should end there. If, however, the answer is in the affirmative, the court moves to the third stage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At the third, stage, it then becomes necessary to consider whether in the circumstances an updating construction ought to be applied and, if so, how. It will be relevant to have regard to the objects of the second statue, how it has hitherto been applied, how the draftsman has chosen to frame the linkage between the two statutes, and whether an updating construction would entail such a substantive change to its operation that it would be best left to the Legislature or whether the change is such as may appropriately be imported into the second statute by way of an updating construction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court explained (at [48]) that in applying an updating construction, the court is not assuming the legislative function but is filling a gap where what is missing is self-evidently within the overall spirit of the legislation and is needed to give effect to the legislative intent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The presumption that an updating construction will be applied is not confined to cases involving two statutes as was the case in <span class="font-italic">CIT.</span> As the court in <span class="font-italic">CIT </span>observed (at [45]), “[t]he problem of course can arise in a number of ways.… A change in a related law is but one facet of this.” The Respondent submits that in the present case, the link is between two provisions within the same piece of legislation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Article 39A and Article 49(1) of the Constitution. Article 39A amended the Constitution by introducing the GRC scheme. This amendment gave rise to the question of how Article 49(1) should be interpreted in the context of GRCs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Applicant submits that the updating construction principle must not be adopted to update constitutional provisions and that doing so is an unprecedented approach bereft of legal basis. I disagree with the Applicant. I see no reason in principle why this tool of statutory interpretation should not apply simply because the written law in question is the Constitution. After all, as confirmed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>(at [35]), the Constitution should be interpreted purposively to give effect to the intent and will of Parliament, and as explained in <span class="font-italic">CIT</span> (at [48]), applying an updating construction gives effect to the legislative intent. Further, the Applicant’s concern that applying an updating construction to the Constitution would be tantamount to introducing a constitutional amendment through the guise of constitutional interpretation, is addressed by the need to consider whether an updating construction would entail such a substantive change that it would be best left to the Legislature (see [29(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Applicant next refers to FAR Bennion, <span class="font-italic">Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">Bennion</span> 5th Ed”) which states (at p 894) that “[a]n updating construction will not be given to an ongoing Act where to do this would go against a presumption that the result in question is intended only where express provision for it is made”. The Applicant relies on this statement to submit that there is a presumption that changes in the law should be expressed through express statutory reform. In my view, the Applicant has misunderstood the statement in <span class="font-italic">Bennion</span> 5th Ed. An example given in the text refers to a case in which the UK House of Lords held that s 51(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (c 54) did not empower the court to order costs to be paid out of central funds where this power was not expressly provided, <span class="font-italic">since to do so would infringe the constitutional principle that no money can be taken out of the Consolidated Fund except under a distinct authorisation from Parliament itself</span>. In other words, an updating construction could not be applied in that case because the result would go against the principle that no money can be taken out of the Consolidated Fund except under a distinct authorisation from Parliament. In the present case, the Applicant has not identified what presumption or principle would be offended by the Respondent’s Interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I agree with the Respondent that an updating construction can be given to a provision in the Constitution. Applying the three-stage analytical framework propounded in <span class="font-italic">CIT</span> to the present case, the first stage is to ascertain the nature of the amendment. In the present case, the Constitution was amended by the insertion of Article 39A. Article 39A introduced the GRC scheme by providing that the Legislature may by law make provision for, among other things, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the President to declare any constituency as a GRC to enable any election in that constituency to be held on the basis of a group of between three to six candidates, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the President to designate every GRC as either a constituency where at least one of the candidates in every group must be a person belonging to the Malay community or a constituency where at least one of the candidates in every group must be a person belonging to the Indian or other minority communities, and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) all the candidates in every group to be either members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Pursuant to Article 39A of the Constitution, amendments were introduced to the PEA giving effect to, among other things, the matters set out at [33] above (see s 8A and s 27A of the PEA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Moving to the second stage of the analysis, there is no doubt that Article 39A gives rise to ambiguity in the interpretation of Article 49(1). Does Article 49(1) apply only to SMCs or can it also apply to GRCs and if so, when? Since there is ambiguity, the third stage of the analysis is now invoked.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 With respect to the third stage of the analysis, the Respondent submits that an updating construction ought to be applied to Article 49(1) and that Article 49(1) should be given the Respondent’s Interpretation because that gives effect to the intent and will of the Legislature. The Legislature’s intent in this respect is clear: a by-election in a GRC will be required only if all the MPs for that GRC have vacated their seats. This intent was clearly expressed in Parliament during the debate on the amendments to the Constitution and the PEA (both were debated as one package): <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, </span><span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (11 Jan 1988), vol 50, cols 191-192, (12 Jan 1988), vol 50, cols 334–335. This intent is also clearly expressed in s 24(2A) of the PEA which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">24.</span> —(2A) In respect of any group representation constituency, no writ shall be issued … for an election to fill any vacancy unless all the Members for that constituency have vacated their seats in Parliament. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Applicant argues that the Parliamentary debates on Article 39A did not specifically address the interpretation of Article 49(1). In my view, that argument does not advance the Applicant’s case. The Parliamentary intention in question in the present case relates to whether it is intended that a by-election in a GRC should be held when one or more, but not all, of the seats in the GRC have been vacated. The Parliamentary debates are directly relevant and on point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I agree with the Respondent’s submissions. An updating construction should be applied to Article 49(1) so that it reflects the changes introduced by Article 39A. As explained at [15]–[17] above, a by-election in the case of a GRC has to be for the whole GRC Team which necessarily means that all the seats must first be vacated. Both the Applicant and the Respondent are in fact in agreement on this. In my view, an updating construction should be applied such that references to “the seat of a Member” in Article 49(1) are interpreted to mean “the seats of all the Members” in the case of a GRC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Rectifying construction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is presumed that the Legislature intends the court to apply a construction which rectifies any error in the drafting of a statute where it is required in order to give effect to the Legislature’s intention: Oliver Jones, <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>on <span class="font-italic">Statutory Interpretation: A Code</span> (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2013) at p 788.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Three cumulative conditions have to be satisfied before the court will read words into a statute to rectify what it perceives to be an error in legislative drafting: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, it is possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole what the mischief is that Parliament sought to remedy with the Act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, it is apparent that the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertence overlooked, and so omitted to deal with, the eventuality that is required to be dealt with so that the purpose of the Act can be achieved; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, it is possible to state with certainty what the additional words would be that the draftsman would have inserted and that Parliament would have approved had their attention been drawn to the omission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Nam Hong Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 694 (“<span class="font-italic">Nam Hong</span>”) at [55], which followed <span class="font-italic">Kok Chong Weng and others v Wiener Robert Lorenz and others (Ankerite Pte Ltd, intervener)</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 709 (“<span class="font-italic">Kok Chong Weng</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, the three conditions set out in <span class="font-italic">Kok Chong Weng </span>are easily satisfied in the present case. First, as discussed earlier, it is clearly Parliament’s intent that no by-election is required in the case of a GRC unless all the seats have been vacated. Second, it is apparent that Parliament gave effect to this intention in s 24(2A) of the PEA but inadvertently omitted to deal with Article 49(1) of the Constitution. Third, it is clear that if Parliament’s attention had been drawn to the omission, it would have approved of the addition in Article 49(1) of language similar to that in s 24(2A) of the PEA. Article 49(1) can therefore also be given a rectifying construction by adding language similar to that in s 24(2A) of the PEA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Strained construction can be justified</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Respondent recognises that the Respondent’s Interpretation may give the literal wording in Article 49(1) a strained construction. However, the Respondent submits that a strained construction may be justified (and in some cases positively required) for any one, or any combination, of the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a repugnance between the words of the enactment and those of some other enactment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) consequences of a literal construction so undesirable that Parliament cannot have intended them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an error in the text which plainly falsifies Parliament’s intention; or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the passage of time since the enactment was originally drafted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Kok Chong Weng </span>at [49]–[50], citing with approval <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>5th Ed at p 458. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Respondent submits that all four reasons above overlap and apply in the present case. I do not think that repugnance between the terms of Article 49(1) of the Constitution and s 24(2A) of the PEA should be a reason justifying a strained construction of Article 49(1) in the present case. After all, under Article 4 of the Constitution, the Constitution is the supreme law and the PEA would be void to the extent of any inconsistency with the Constitution. However, I agree with the Respondent that the other three reasons overlap and apply in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Respondent’s Interpretation is a possible interpretation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the above reasons, in my view, the Respondent’s Interpretation is a possible interpretation of Article 49(1) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic"> The Respondent’s Alternative Interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Respondent’s Alternative Interpretation is based on a literal reading of Article 49(1) and is a possible interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legislative purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having ascertained the possible interpretations of Article 49(1), the next step is to ascertain the legislative purpose. In drawing out the legislative purpose behind a provision, primacy should be accorded to the text of the provision and its statutory context over any extraneous material. However, when the provision on its face is ambiguous, the court may consider extraneous material. See <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [43] and [47]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As already discussed, the legislative purpose is clear. All elections (including by-elections) in any GRC shall be held on a basis of such number of candidates as designated for that constituency by the President, and no by-election needs to be held to fill any vacancy in a GRC unless all the Members in that GRC have vacated their seats.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my view, the legislative purpose can be drawn from the statutory context. Under 39A of the Constitution, elections in a GRC are to be held on the basis of a group of candidates as designated by the President. It follows that all the seats in the GRC must be vacated before an election can be held. In any event, since Article 49(1) is ambiguous as to its application to GRCs, it is permissible to consider extraneous material. In this case, as discussed earlier, the same conclusion would be reached on considering the extraneous material.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Comparing the possible interpretations against the legislative purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is clear that of the two possible interpretations of Article 49(1) proffered by the Respondent, the Respondent’s Interpretation is to be preferred because it furthers the legislative purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I would add that even if the Applicant’s Interpretation were a possible interpretation of Article 49(1), it would not be one which furthers the legislative purpose and the Respondent’s Interpretation would still be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the Respondent’s Interpretation is therefore the correct interpretation of Article 49(1).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second ground: Article 39A(2)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In her written submissions, the Applicant also argues that a by-election has to be held because Article 39A(2) of the Constitution requires that a GRC be represented by an MP belonging to a minority community, until the dissolution of Parliament. It will be recalled that in the present case, the seat that was vacated in the MYT GRC belonged to an MP belonging to the Malay community. However, during oral submissions, the Applicant clarified that her case is that a by-election must be held if <span class="font-italic">any </span>seat in a GRC (whether held by an MP belonging to a minority community or not) is vacated. The Applicant accepted that accordingly, her submissions on this second ground would no longer apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In any event, in my view, the Applicant’s reliance on this second ground fails for the same reasons that her reliance on the first ground fails. Whether the vacated seat was held by an MP belonging to a minority community or not, a by-election for the whole GRC Team cannot be held unless the remaining MPs can be compelled to vacate their seats. As discussed, there is no basis in law to compel the remaining MPs to vacate their seats.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third ground: The right to be represented in Parliament</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Applicant submits that a by-election must be held in the present case because voters have an implied right under the Constitution to be represented by an Elected MP of their choice until the dissolution of Parliament. The Applicant relies on the following observation by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span> (at [79]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]t is vital to remind ourselves that the form of government of the Republic of Singapore as reflected in the Constitution is the Westminster model of government, with the party commanding the majority support in Parliament having the mandate to form the government. The authority of the government emanates from the people. Each Member represents the people of the constituency who voted him into Parliament. The voters of a constituency are entitled to have a Member representing and speaking for them in Parliament. The Member is not just the mouthpiece but the voice of the people of the constituency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Applicant also relies on <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1129 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong</span>”). In that case, the Court of Appeal noted (at [69]) that the basic structure doctrine postulates that there are certain fundamental features of a constitution that cannot be amended by Parliament. However, the Court of Appeal expressed no view on whether the basic structure doctrine is part of the law in Singapore since it was not considering the validity of a constitutional amendment (at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Nevertheless, the Applicant relies on the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong</span> (at [69]) that the right to vote cannot be found in the Constitution and that the Government had acknowledged in 2001 that it is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Court of Appeal also referred (at [70]) to the passage from <span class="font-italic">Vellama </span>set out at [54] above which expressed the philosophical underpinnings of the right to vote in the Westminster model of government set up by the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the present case, the Applicant is not challenging the validity of a constitutional amendment. Accordingly, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it is unnecessary for me to decide whether the basic structure doctrine is part of the law in Singapore. In any event, I agree with the Respondent that the voters in the MYT GRC have not lost their right to be represented in Parliament. Under the GRC scheme, voters in the GRC vote not for individual MPs but for the GRC Team. It is the GRC Team that represents the GRC in Parliament. In the present case, the MYT GRC has continued to be represented in Parliament by the MYT GRC Team (albeit comprising one MP less). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Applicant’s alternative case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Applicant’s alternative case (see [4] above) is that to be consistent with Article 49(1) of the Constitution, s 24(2A) of the PEA must be interpreted as requiring all the MPs in a GRC to vacate their seats when (a) one of more seats is vacated or (b) in the alternative when the only MP from a minority community in the GRC vacates his or her seat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The alleged inconsistency with Article 49(1) arises only if the Applicant’s Interpretation is correct. Since I have rejected the Applicant’s Interpretation, there is no inconsistency between s 24(2A) of the PEA and Article 49(1) of the Constitution. The Applicant’s alternative case therefore falls away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In any event, it is difficult to see how the declaratory order sought in respect of s 24(2A) of the PEA can succeed. Section 24(2A) of the PEA expresses Parliament’s intention that there will be no by-election to fill any vacancy in a GRC unless all the MPs in the GRC have vacated their seats. During oral submissions, the Applicant argued that it is implied in s 24(2A) that the remaining MPs must resign if any seat in the GRC has been vacated. In my view, it is patently clear that the plain language of s 24(2A) permits of no such interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Applicant’s case cannot succeed for the above reasons. In particular, the Applicant’s Interpretation depends on the existence of a legal basis to compel the remaining MPs of the MYT GRC to vacate their seats. There is clearly no such legal basis in the present case and therefore the Applicant’s Interpretation cannot be correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my view, the Applicant has not shown an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case and accordingly, leave is not granted for the application for the mandatory orders. In any event, even if leave were granted, the application still fails for the reasons set out above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Respondent’s Interpretation is the correct interpretation of Article 49(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I therefore dismiss the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As for costs, the Applicant referred me to the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General</span> [2013] 1 SLR 797 in which the High Court made no order as to costs on the ground that the application raised public law issues of general importance and the applicant was not seeking to protect some private interest. The Respondent accepted that public interest is a relevant factor to consider. However, the Respondent submitted that in the present case, the primary focus of the application was on the mandatory order to compel the remaining MPs in the MYT GRC to vacate their seats and there was no basis at all for this. The Respondent therefore submitted that costs should follow the event. I agreed with the Respondent. As the Applicant did not disagree with the Respondent’s quantification of costs, I ordered costs to be paid by the Applicant to the Respondent fixed at $10,764.35 inclusive of  disbursements.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Peter Low, Priscilla Chia, Elaine Low, and <br/>Ng Bing Hong (Messrs Peter Low &amp; Choo LLC) <br/>Hri Kumar Nair SC, Hui Choon Kuen, and <br/>Sivakumar Ramasamy (Attorney-General’s Chambers) <br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
