On 16 April 2016, Mr Shepherdson stood up during the annual general meeting of SRC (the “2016 AGM”) to raise a point of order. He was told by the chairman to sit down. An altercation between the chairman and Mr Shepherdson ensued. Mr Shepherdson did not succeed in raising the point of order, and left the hall where the 2016 AGM was held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Thus began the start of Mr Shepherdson’s woes. Shortly after the 2016 AGM, SRC received three written complaints about Mr Shepherdson’s conduct at the 2016 AGM. A disciplinary committee was convened, and it found Mr Shepherdson guilty of two breaches of the Singapore Recreation Club Constitution (“SRC’s Constitution”). Mr Shepherdson appealed against the decision of the disciplinary committee to the Management Committee (“MC”) of the SRC, which upheld the decision of the disciplinary committee. As a result, Mr Shepherdson was suspended for a period of 12 months commencing 15 December 2016, and ordered to pay a fine of $1,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Dissatisfied, Mr Shepherdson applied in this action to set aside SRC’s decision. The matter came for hearing before Woo Bih Li J, who nullified the suspension and the fine, and ordered SRC to pay damages, the quantum of which was to be assessed (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson, Terence Christopher v Singapore Recreation Club </span>[2017] SGHC 323 (<span class="font-italic">“Shepherdson v SRC</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The proceedings before me concerned the assessment of damages payable as a result of Mr Shepherdson’s invalid suspension from SRC. Having considered the evidence before me and the parties’ arguments, I award $3,600 as damages for the deprivation of membership rights and privileges, and $14,000 as damages for mental distress. I set out my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The detailed facts of the case are set out in <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC</span>, so I will only highlight the facts which are relevant to the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suspension from SRC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 16 April 2016, SRC held its 2016 AGM at the Raffles City Convention Centre. The chairman of the meeting was the then Vice-President of the MC, Dr Sarbjit Singh (“Dr Singh”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After a quorum was reached, Dr Singh called the meeting to order and started his opening address without opening the voting booth. Mr Shepherdson approached the nearest microphone in the hall and raised a point of order that the voting booth should be opened immediately after a quorum was reached. Mr Shepherdson’s view was based on Rule 35(e)(ii) of SRC’s Constitution, and he was motivated by the desire that members be allowed to cast their votes without having to wait until the conclusion of Dr Singh’s speech (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [4]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Dr Singh told Mr Shepherdson to sit down, and took the view that the voting booth should only be opened after he had concluded his speech. Mr Shepherdson tried to repeat his point, but his microphone was switched off.

</div>
</div> Mr Shepherdson left the hall after the argument, and the voting booth was opened after Dr Singh concluded his speech.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Between 20 and 26 April 2016, SRC received three written complaints from Mr Shawn Chua, Mr Maxwell Norbert Fernando (“Mr Fernando”) and Ms Paul Elizabeth (“Ms Elizabeth”) about Mr Shepherdson’s conduct at the 2016 AGM (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [5]). Mr Shawn Chua passed away on 10 July 2016 before the Complaints Committee (“CC”) was appointed so SRC took the position that his complaint was to be treated as having been withdrawn (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The CC convened on 30 August 2016 to consider the remaining two complaints against Mr Shepherdson, and recommended that the complaints be referred to a Disciplinary Committee (“DC”), which was constituted on 10 October 2016. The CC recommended that the following two charges be brought against Mr Shepherdson regarding his conduct at the 2016 AGM (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [16]-[18]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the first was for disorderly and boisterous behaviour on the part of Mr Shepherdson when Dr Singh was delivering his opening address, in breach of Rule 30(b)(vi) of SRC’s Constitution; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the second was for deliberately heckling Dr Singh during his opening address, in breach of Rule 30(b)(xiii) of SRC’s Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The DC hearing took place on 2 November 2016, with Mr Shepherdson and various witnesses in attendance. On 8 November 2016, the DC issued its written report and found Mr Shepherdson guilty of both charges. The DC recommended that Mr Shepherdson be fined $1,000 on the first charge, and suspended for 12 months on the second charge (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 16 November 2016, SRC notified Mr Shepherdson of the DC’s decision, and informed him that he had 14 days to appeal against that decision to the MC. Mr Shepherdson appealed against the DC’s decision on 28 November 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The MC held a meeting on 12 December 2016 to consider the appeal (the “MC Meeting”). At the MC Meeting, Dr Singh recused himself and asked three others – Mr Fabian Chan (“Mr Chan”), Mr Ronald Wee (“Mr Wee”) and Mr Tay Peng Kee (“Mr Tay”) – to recuse themselves as well (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson </span><span class="font-italic">v SRC </span>at [55]). For Mr Chan, Dr Singh’s purported reason for asking him to recuse himself was that Mr Chan had previously made a complaint against Mr Shepherdson. For the other two, Dr Singh’s purported reason was that they would have been biased in Mr Shepherdson’s favour because they were informally part of the same team that stood for election at the 2016 AGM. Mr Chan, Mr Wee, and Mr Tay agreed to recuse themselves. As a result, seven members of the MC (“Remaining Seven Members”) were left to consider the appeal and they decided to uphold the decision of the DC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 By way of a letter dated 14 December 2016, SRC informed Mr Shepherdson that:

Most of these arguments were either not pursued or were not accepted by Woo J (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC</span> at [27]-[53]). Woo J did however find that the MC failed to give Mr Shepherdson a fair hearing for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Dr Singh had an interest in the complaints made against Mr Shepherdson (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [57]-[60]). Although Dr Singh was not one of the complainants, he was in substance as directly interested as Mr Fernando and Ms Elizabeth in the complaints as he was the very person with whom Mr Shepherdson had an altercation with at the 2016 AGM and he complained about Mr Shepherdson’s conduct when he appeared as a witness at the DC hearing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Remaining Seven Members had acted inconsistently with respect to the recusal of Mr Wee and Mr Tay (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [69]). On the one hand, the Remaining Seven Members appeared to have agreed with Dr Singh’s assessment that it would have been improper for Mr Wee and Mr Tay to consider the appeal, as they had stood for election at the 2016 AGM with Mr Shepherdson as a team. On the other hand, however, they did not seem to think it improper for them to sit, even though they had likewise stood for election as part of a team <span class="font-italic">with Dr Singh</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In Woo J’s view, this inconsistency constituted apparent bias, if not actual bias, against Mr Shepherdson. Even if it was true that the Remaining Seven Members would have outvoted Mr Wee and Mr Tay and the result would have been the same, the process was tainted (see <span class="font-italic">Shepherdson v SRC </span>at [70]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 As a result, on 3 November 2017, Woo J granted Mr Shepherdson’s application to nullify the suspension and the fine. Woo J also ordered SRC to pay damages to be assessed by the Registrar, with the costs of the assessment of damages and interest also to be determined by the Registrar.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 SRC reactivated Mr Shepherdson’s membership on 3 November 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on the same day as Woo J’s decision), and thereafter sent Mr Shepherdson a letter dated 6 November 2017 to inform him of this.

In the words of AR Teo in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> (at [33]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The member’s] claim properly understood is one in <span class="font-italic">breach of contract</span>, ie that the [club] had wrongfully suspended her membership in breach of the terms of the contract found in the constitution and rules of the club. There is a “judicial review” of the [club’s decision] to the extent of questioning whether it is in line with the rules of natural justice for the purpose of determining if there had been a breach of the contract, such natural justice rules being either expressly or … impliedly provided for under the contract in the form of the [club’s] constitution… <span class="font-italic">Properly conceived, the claim for damages hence arises from a contract</span><span class="font-italic">ual breach, and it is therefore to the contractual principles of damages that recourse should be had in assessing the quantum of the damages that is payable in this case</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> and the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng and another v Singapore Swimming Club </span>[2016] 2 SLR 489 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>have recognised two types of general damages that can be recovered (subject to proof) for the wrongful suspension of a club membership. The first is damages for deprivation of the member’s rights and privileges, while the second type is damages for mental distress<span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The chief challenge for the court when assessing damages in such cases lies in difficulties of proof. It is often impossible for the member to prove, with complete certainty, the exact amount of damage that he or she has suffered, as precise evidence on the quantum of loss does not exist. The law, however, does not demand that an innocent party prove with complete certainty the exact amount of damage he has suffered (see <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investments Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 at [28]). In cases where precise evidence cannot be obtained, the court will assess damages as best as it can, based on the available evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [52]–[53]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Deprivation of Membership Rights and Privileges </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Damages for deprivation of membership rights and privileges seek to compensate the member for a loss of membership during the period of suspension. The loss suffered is pecuniary for two reasons. First, the member – who has paid the membership fee for the club – did not get what he paid for, for he was wrongfully deprived of access to, and use of, the club, and is unable to exercise his membership rights such as the right to attend and vote at annual general meetings (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [49], [54], [55] and [76]). Secondly, where the membership is transferrable and is of financial value, the loss of membership during the period of suspension constitutes a direct pecuniary loss (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 A flexible approach is warranted when it comes to an assessment of damages for the deprivation of membership rights and privileges (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [54]). Where membership fees are payable each year on the basis of a fixed annual fee, the quantification of damages should take reference from that. On the other hand, where membership fees are payable upfront as a lump sum for a life term, a broad-brush approach should be adopted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 A broad-brush approach was applied in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span>, which involved the wrongful suspension of a member from the Singapore Island Country Club (“SICC”). The issue confronting the court was the amount of damages payable for the deprivation of membership rights for one year. The member had purchased lifetime membership at SICC for $190,000 in 1992 but at the assessment of damages hearing, the court heard evidence that a lifetime membership at SICC was then valued between $200,000 and $250,000. There was also evidence that a term membership for one year cost $24,000, but a term member (unlike a life member) has no right to vote at the annual general meeting nor is he able to hold office or be co-opted to serve in committees of the SICC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 AR Teo, after applying a one-third uplift to the price of term membership to reflect the value of the additional rights enjoyed by life members (such as the right to vote), and also having regard to the costs of a lifetime membership, awarded $32,000 to the member as damages for the deprivation of membership rights and privileges. AR Teo recognised that such an approach was far from scientific, but held that it was the best the assessing court could do to achieve a just result. At [57], AR Teo explained his decision thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having regard to how much a lifetime SICC membership costs, and applying a suitable premium to the price of a term membership to reflect the value of rights such as the right to vote, I award $32,000 as damages to [the member] for the deprivation of her membership rights and loss of use of facilities for the one year period of suspension. In reaching this conclusion, <span class="font-italic">I readily concede that a broad-based approach has been adopted and the process of assessment is far from a scientific inquiry to any degree. Nevertheless, the assessing court must do its best within the practical limits to make a fair award and achieve as just a result as the law is capable of producing</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mental Distress</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The second type of damages is non-pecuniary in nature and is what I would term broadly as mental distress damages. Mental distress damages are meant to compensate the innocent party for intangible mental harm or undesirable sensory experiences such as feelings of disappointment, distress, frustration, anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment that are caused by the breach of contract (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> at [63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Mental distress damages are recoverable in situations where the object of the contract is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from distress (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [69], <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng </span>at [102], <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2017] 2 SLR 129 at [83]). It is clear that a contract for membership with a recreational club comes within the class of contracts whose object is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from distress (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [74] and <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng </span>at [102]). Mental distress damages are awarded as the member does not receive the promised peace of mind or freedom from distress, and may be subjected instead to opposite feelings of distress and the worsening of the mental condition (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [76]). Without mental distress damages, the member is not fully compensated because he is not put into as good a position as he would have been if the contract had been performed (see Andrew S. Burrows, “Mental Distress Damages in Contract – a Decade of Change” [1984] LMCLQ 119 (“Burrows”) at 133).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The case law does not disclose any clear approach on how the assessing court ought to undertake the exercise of quantifying damages for mental distress. This is not altogether surprising given that the award of mental distress damages for wrongful suspension of club membership is relatively uncommon. In approaching this exercise, I am mindful that the quantification of damages for intangible mental harm or undesirable sensory experiences is an exercise fraught with difficulty, as it involves the ascription of a monetary value to matters which do not lend themselves easily to pecuniary expression (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [88] and <span class="font-italic">Hazwani bte Amin v Chia Heok Meng </span>[2018] SGHCR 2 at [9]). Nevertheless, if the aim is that justice meted out to all litigants should be even-handed, there ought to be both internal consistency in the award of mental distress damages in cases involving the wrongful suspension of club memberships, as well as external consistency with the levels of damages awarded in other fields (see Michael G. Bridge, “Contractual Damages for Intangible Loss: A Comparative Analysis” (1984) 62 Canadian Bar Review 323 at 368 and <span class="font-italic">Milner and another v Carnival plc (trading as Cunard) </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 389 (“<span class="font-italic">Milner</span>”) at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I will set out below what I think ought to be the approach of the assessing court in quantifying the mental distress damages in cases involving wrongful suspension of club memberships. Before going there, however, I will consider the past cases on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic"> Past Cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 An early decision involving the award of mental distress damages for the wrongful suspension of a club membership is the Malaysian decision of <span class="font-italic">Florence Bailes v </span><span class="font-italic">Dr Ng Jit Leong </span>[1985] 1 MLJ 374 (“<span class="font-italic">Florence Bailes</span>”). The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Florence Bailes</span> was a lady associate of the Penang Club by virtue of her husband being an ordinary member of the same (see 375). As a lady associate, the plaintiff was entitled to the full privileges of ordinary membership, but had to pay a monthly subscription fee of RM2 (at 375 and 381). The club committee suspended the plaintiff for a period of three months owing to an incident where the plaintiff allegedly made derogatory remarks about another lady associate in the presence of several other persons in the games room (at 375-376). Dissatisfied, she challenged the decision of the club committee by way of an application for judicial review. Ajaib Singh J found that the club’s committee had wrongfully suspended the plaintiff in breach of the rules of natural justice, and nullified the plaintiff’s suspension from the club (at 378-381). Singh J also awarded RM10,000 in damages for the embarrassment, distress and humiliation which the plaintiff suffered as a result of the wrongful suspension. Singh J did not explain how he arrived at the figure of RM10,000 and his reasoning was simply as follows (at 381):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The plaintiff] has been a lady associate for about 14 years. Before her suspension she went to the club almost every day and her social life revolved around the club. She is still a lady associate but she said in evidence in court that after her suspension she did not go back to the club because she felt embarrassed, anguished and upset. She now goes to other clubs.

I agree with the views of Professor Andrew Burrows that a distinction must be drawn between two basic categories of mental distress. First, there is mental distress in the sense of <span class="font-italic">disappointment or frustration</span> at not receiving an expected mental benefit; second, there is mental distress <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">the sense of an “injury” to a person’s mental condition</span> (see Burrows at 122-123). The injury to one’s mental condition can arise from worry, stress, and embarrassment, and also manifest in more serious forms, such as the development of a recognised psychiatric condition. The assessing court should be astute as to whether the member is claiming damages for one or both types of mental distress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2: </span>The second step is to assess the severity of the mental distress that had been caused. This is a question of fact and degree in each case: <span class="font-italic">Milner </span>at [35]. In assessing the severity of the mental distress, the Court can take into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following non-exhaustive factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the length of the suspension (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [90]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the extent of the member’s involvement in the club prior to suspension (see <span class="font-italic">Florence Bailes </span>at 381);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the nature of the complaint against the member, including whether the complaint imputed dishonesty on the member’s part (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [87]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the suspension was publicised, and whether the other members of the club knew of the suspension (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [87] and <span class="font-italic">Florence Bailes </span>at 381);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the member suffered injury to his mental condition as a result of the suspension – in this connection, I find the guidance in the chapter on psychiatric conditions in the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span>”) helpful in assessing whether the injury suffered is minor or severe (see, in particular, the guidance for general psychiatric disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder at 25-28).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Mental distress cases can be placed on a spectrum. Cases involving feelings of disappointment or frustration at not receiving an expected mental benefit will arguably fall within the lower end of the spectrum, because such feelings are transitory and would tend to resolve over time.  Cases involving injuries to the member’s mental condition of a serious and long-lasting nature, such as psychiatric injuries that are likely to persist in the long term even with medical treatment, will fall within the more serious end of the spectrum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 3</span>: After assessing the severity of the mental distress caused, the third step is to quantify the award, having regard to awards made in comparable cases. The court should first have regard to awards where a member was awarded mental distress damages for wrongful suspensions of club membership. However, the search for comparable cases must also extend to other fields of law where damages are awarded for intangible mental harm or undesirable sensory experiences, and in this regard, the obvious comparison would be awards in personal injury cases where psychiatric injury has been suffered (see <span class="font-italic">Milner</span> at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 At the end of the day, it should be borne in mind that the courts have approached the quantifying of damages for mental distress in contract law conservatively (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [91]). As Lord Steyn observed in <span class="font-italic">Farley v Skinner </span>[2001] 4 All ER 801 at [28]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I have to say that the size of the award [of £10,000] appears to be at the very top of what could possibly be regarded as appropriate damages… <span class="font-italic">I consider that awards in this area should be restrained and modest</span>.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Since Mr Shepherdson’s membership fee was paid upfront in a lump sum, a broad brush approach is warranted to quantify the damages for deprivation of membership rights and privileges (see paras [31]–[33] above). Bearing in mind the matters stated in the preceding paragraph, I find it appropriate to award damages by (a) applying a one-third uplift to the price of a one-year term membership (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $2,140) to take into account the right to vote and the right to hold office and (b) adding the monthly subscription fee of $69.55 which Mr Shepherdson had to pay during the period of suspension even though he could not make use of SRC’s facilities. Accordingly, I award Mr Shepherdson damages of $3,600 for the deprivation of his membership rights and privileges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For completeness, I do not accept Mr Shepherdson’s position that he should be awarded $35,000 in damages for this head of claim.

</div> I do not accept these contentions for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, this head of damages is meant to compensate Mr Shepherdson for the <span class="font-italic">pecuniary</span> loss he suffered as a result of the loss of his membership. There is no evidence which supports the argument that the financial value of this loss of membership is $35,000. To put things into perspective, the $35,000 claimed is around two-thirds of the price Mr Shepherdson paid in 1996 for his <span class="font-italic">lifetime</span> ordinary membership. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, I am unable to place any weight on Mr Shepherdson’s allegation that the membership fees at SRC are low due to the MC embroiling the club in numerous legal disputes. For a start, there is insufficient evidence before me to justify such a conclusion. But more importantly, this contention is irrelevant. Mr Shepherdson does not dispute the evidence on the present value of the membership at SRC, which is the basis on which to assess his pecuniary loss. Even if it were true that the value of membership is low due to poor management, Mr Shepherdson’s recourse (if any) lies elsewhere, and does not lie in increased damages for his claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2 – Damages for Mental Distress</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I now consider whether Mr Shepherdson can claim mental distress damages, and if so, the appropriate quantum to be awarded for this head of loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On the authority of <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span>, it is clear that mental distress damages are recoverable here. A contract for membership at SRC comes within the class of contracts whose object is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from distress to the member (see para [35] above).

An adjustment disorder, as Dr Fones explained in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, is the development of “emotional or behavioural symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor [that] are out of proportion to the intensity of the stressor”, thereby “leading to significant impairment in social, occupational and other important areas of functioning”.

However, Dr Fones accepted in cross-examination that he only examined Mr Shepherdson seven months after Woo J’s decision in November 2017, and that Mr Shepherdson may have been more distressed in the months leading up to Woo J’s decision.

</div> In my view, having considered all the evidence, Mr Shepherdson probably suffered a psychiatric condition of a “moderate” severity as a result of his suspension from SRC (see <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages </span>at 25-27).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Accordingly, taking into account the factors above, in particular (a) the effect of the suspension on Mr Shepherdson’s behaviour, (b) the public nature of Mr Shepherdson’s humiliation, (c) impact on Mr Shepherdson’s social life for ten and a half months, (d) the adjustment disorder, and (e) that Mr Shepherdson’s behaviour appeared to have largely returned to normal after Woo J decided in his favour, I assess the mental distress suffered by Mr Shepherdson to be of a moderate to moderately severe nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For completeness, I do not accept SRC’s contention that Mr Shepherdson exaggerated his symptoms of mental distress.

</div> The fact that there had been other suspensions is irrelevant to the assessment of the suffering caused by a wrongful one and its impact on that particular member. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 3: Quantifying the Damages </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I now address the quantification of damages. In terms of comparable cases, the decision of <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> comes to mind. The $40,000 in damages awarded for mental distress appeared to be motivated by the one-year period of suspension and the significant degree of humiliation and embarrassment inflicted on the plaintiff (see para [39] above). In comparison with the facts of <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span>, Mr Shepherdson’s suspension is slightly shorter in duration, and the degree of humiliation and embarrassment suffered is arguably less pronounced because (a) the charges against him did not contain imputations of dishonesty and (b) his suspension was not publicised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 However, I decline to rely on <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> as a benchmark for mental distress damages. Instead, I prefer to have regard to comparable awards for general psychiatric conditions which are set out in the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span> for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages </span>represent the efforts of a team of authors distilling guidelines from a number of precedent cases. In contrast, AR Teo in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> admitted that he did not have any precedents to rely on, and awarded damages “[b]ased on the rather limited material and arguments on the quantum of damages” before him (see [89]-[92]). Further, the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages </span>was published in 2010, and AR Teo did not have the benefit of it when he decided <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>in 2008.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>did not suffer any psychiatric injury of a serious nature or any long-term impairment to coping with the activities of daily life. Accordingly, the mental distress damages awarded in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>is rather high when compared against the range of $25,000 to $55,000 recommended for an individual who suffers a severe psychiatric condition that affects his ability to return to employment permanently or even take charge of his daily affairs (see <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span> at 26).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Based on the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span>, the range of $3,000 to $8,000 is recommended for psychiatric conditions of a moderate nature where the prognosis is good and the individual shows marked improvement with treatment (at 27). As for psychiatric conditions of a moderately severe nature where the person may have long-term problems coping with work life and social life, the range of damages is $8,000 to $25,000 (see <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span> at 26). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In this case, having assessed the mental distress suffered by Mr Shepherdson to be of a moderate to moderately severe nature, the appropriate range of damages should be $8,000 to $25,000. In my view, the higher end of this range should be reserved for cases with long-term impairment, of which there is none here. That being said, it does appear that Mr Shepherdson suffered quite acutely for a while and developed a recognised psychiatric condition that affected both his social and family life. Mr Shepherdson’s behaviour has not returned fully to normal, and there is still some form of continuing loss in the attenuation of the pleasure he gets from returning to SRC (see para [65] above). In the circumstances, I find it appropriate to award Mr Shepherdson $14,000 in damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For the foregoing reasons, I assess the amount of damages for the deprivation of membership rights and privileges at $3,600, and the damages for mental distress at $14,000. The total quantum of damages awarded to Mr Shepherdson is $17,600. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I will hear parties on interest and costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Navin Anand<br/>Assistant Registrar  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ganesh Ramanathan (Karuppan Chettiar &amp; Partners) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Ponnampalam Sivakumar and Tan Shi Yun Jolene (BR Law Corporation) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
