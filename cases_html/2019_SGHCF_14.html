Prior to the Testator’s demise, the Brothers had been appointed as directors in the Companies (save for UVJ’s directorships in [A] Trading, [B] Development and [C] Investments), and had held shares in their own names.

</div> At various junctures, he suggested that the matter be listed again for trial, or a new statement of claim be filed; no authorities were tendered in aid of these propositions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I agree with Mr Jeyaretnam SC that the statement of claim has sufficiently prayed for the remedies requested. The pleading for the removal of executors is conceded. As for the account of profits, Prayer B requests “[a]n account of what is due to the Plaintiffs and payment of the amount found due on taking the account”. This prayer envisaged that the Sisters would claim any entitlement arising from an account, including any account of profits that may be due. Regarding the Order of Court, clauses 1 and 2 would sufficiently deal with all remedies arising out of the taking of the account. Clause 3 stipulated restitution for any sums found misappropriated; in any event it could not be said to limit any wider remedies for any misfeasance established arising from clauses 1 and 2. The Sisters, in their notice of objections and non-admissions dated 22 September 2017 filed in response to the accounts, specifically included a surcharge for an account of profits for “[u]nauthorised profits made by the Defendants” and “[p]ersonal expenses of the Defendants which were borne by the Companies”, at items 6 and 7.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Brothers emphasise that the taking of an account functions as a process, not as a remedy (<span class="font-italic">Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 at [26]). It does <span class="font-italic">not</span> follow, in my view, that remedies are not available at the end of the process. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 summarised the process of taking accounts as a three-step process, at [22], with “any consequential relief” listed as the last step. The Court of Appeal stated at [20]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The accounting procedure under the law of equity is often used for a variety of purposes. In a case involving a violation of fiduciary duties, the court may order an account of profits in order to disgorge profits wrongfully gained by the defendant. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As explained by Lord Millett in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments L</span><span class="font-italic">td v Thomas Alexej Hall</span> [2013] HKCFA 93 (“<span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span>”) at [167]–[168]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">167 It is often said that the primary remedy for breach of trust or fiduciary duty is an order for an account, but this is an abbreviated and potentially misleading statement of the true position. In the first place an account is not a remedy for wrong. … Once the trust or fiduciary relationship is established or conceded the beneficiary or principal is entitled to an account as of right. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">168 In the second place an order for an account does not in itself provide the plaintiff with a remedy; <span class="font-italic">it is merely the first step in a process which enables him to identify and quantify any </span><span class="font-italic">deficit in the trust fund and seek the appropriate means by which it may be made good</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is only upon the taking of an account, then, that the true position between the fiduciary and the beneficiary may be ascertained. It is at that time that the beneficiary may identify any deficit in the trust fund or estate and request any consequential relief (see <span class="font-italic">Tongbao (Singapore) Shipping Pte Ltd and another v Woon Swee Huat and others</span> [2018] SGHC 165 at [124]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The present taking of accounts has an additional feature that it was ordered on a wilful default basis. The purpose of such accounting is to discover concealed misconduct. Misconduct may be investigated that was neither pleaded nor mentioned at the hearing at which the accounting was directed and the defendants may be charged accordingly: see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) at para 20-025(b)(2). It was explained in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2018] SGHC 131 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span>”) at [83], citing <span class="font-italic">Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co (No 2)</span> [1980] 1 Ch 515, 546, that in such cases, the trustee is subject to a “roving commission”, where the judge is entitled to look into all aspects of the trustee’s management. In that case, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J also dealt with various consequential reliefs after the taking of an account, including an account of profits for various service fees (at [241]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 No authority stipulating the requirement of an additional summons or other step in order for consequential relief to be granted has been cited, despite the Brothers’ contentions that such is necessary. Nor is any reason proffered for a further trial. No further evidence is needed. The remedies that the Sisters ask for have been made clear from the outset, through the statement of claim, the notice of objections and non-admissions, their opening statement, and counsel’s cross-examination in the course of the taking of accounts. At the close of evidence, issues were listed for counsel to address and time was given for both written submissions and oral responses. In my judgment, the issue must be one of proper notice and opportunity to address any necessary points. Here, the Brothers have had sufficient notice and time to address all the allegations thoroughly and to have made all arguments in their own favour. Accordingly, I am of the view that I may grant such remedies as the Sisters establish are necessary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidential issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The second preliminary issue arises from the process of the accounts being taken on a wilful default basis. Counsel agreed when they appeared before me at the pre-trial conference (“JPTC”) that the order of witnesses would be reversed for the taking of the accounts, as the basis for the account was that of wilful default and the Brothers were fiduciaries who would possess direct knowledge of the accounts’ administration. After the Brothers’ case closed, the Sisters decided not to give evidence, choosing to rely on the admissions that had been made by the Brothers in cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27  The Brothers contend that the effect of the Sisters’ decision to not give evidence is threefold. First, that the Sisters cannot dispute the Brothers’ version of events. Secondly, that adverse inferences should be drawn against the Sisters under s 116(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  NE 4 April 2019, p 11.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There appears to be some misunderstanding of the course of events. The accounts were ordered to be taken on a wilful default basis because the Sisters were able, on a summary basis, to establish failure on the part of the Brothers to exercise the requisite standard of care. This was the effect of the hearing on 10 April 2017, from which the Brothers did not appeal. In the brief oral grounds given at the time of judgment, I highlighted at least two breaches of fiduciary duties. The first was the failure on the part of the Brothers to furnish any form of account for some 19 years. The second was the failure to distribute or deal with the shares in the Companies. Putting the Brothers’ case at its highest at the point that summary judgment was given, they ought to have turned their attention to the general devise once they had dealt with the pecuniary legacies to the Half-Siblings in October 2004. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It follows, then, from the premise of their default as fiduciaries, that the onus is on the Brothers to make sense of the accounts. As Arden LJ (as she then was) explained in <span class="font-italic">Murad</span><span class="font-italic"> v Al-Saraj </span>[2005] EWCA Civ 959 (“<span class="font-italic">Murad</span>”) at [77], the onus is on the defaulting fiduciary to explain his actions: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Again, for the policy reasons, on the taking of an account, the court lays the burden on the defaulting fiduciary to show that the profit is not one for which he should account: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Manley v Sartori</span> [1927] Ch 157. This shifting of the onus of proof is consistent with the deterrent nature of the fiduciary’s liability. The liability of the fiduciary becomes the default rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the Brothers’ attempt to discharge their liability, the court may choose to accept their explanation, but again, it would be entirely logical that the court may choose not to. Neither is the court bound to accept their version of disputed facts. By not taking the stand for cross-examination, the Sisters do not have the benefit of their affidavits of evidence-in-chief. That does not, however, lead to the conclusion that the Sisters accept the Brothers’ version of events. As a matter of logic, it simply means that the Sisters are of the view that the Brothers’ admissions are sufficient to establish their case. The Court’s duty to assess evidence remains. As the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte ltd and other</span><span class="font-italic">s v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others</span> [2014] 3 SLR 562 at [56]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… ultimately, the trial judge has to consider the <span class="font-italic">totality</span> of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence. This includes contemporaneous objective documentary evidence. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It also follows that the Brothers’ position on drawing an adverse inference is wholly misplaced. Section 116(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the EA states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">116. </span>The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-left"><span class="font-italic">Illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court may presume ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The wording of s 116(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) makes it clear that the drawing of an adverse inference is dependent on the court’s discretion, and whether one is drawn depends upon all the circumstances of the case. In a situation of a taking of accounts, the only persons who are able to give direct evidence as to the administration of the estate are the executors. <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>is a case in point, where at [29], Vinodh Coomaraswamy J stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Only the Engs can give direct evidence as to much of their dealings with the Wees’ monies and assets. Only the Engs can give direct evidence as to how they came to incur many of the disputed expenses. Hence, the failure of the Wees to be cross-examined in the accounting phase of this action on aspects of the Wees’ case on which they cannot give direct evidence does not justify an adverse inference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Where the evidence concerns the administration of the estate, it is unlikely that the beneficiaries would be in possession of the relevant details. The present case is no different. The Sisters only discovered various instances of purported wrongdoing by the Brothers upon the taking of the Estate’s account. The Sisters are hence allowed to rely on the admissions and concessions of the Brothers in particularising and substantiating their claims, including fresh evidence of breaches of fiduciary duties raised by the account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Coming then, to the reversal of the order of witnesses, while counsel agreed to the order of witnesses at the JPTC, comments were made at various points of submission that this was erroneous. I should therefore make clear that I was in any event of the view that the Brothers ought to take the stand first. Order 35 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) confers upon the trial judge the power to give directions as to the party to begin. The court has a discretion to order the defendant to begin first (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2019) at para 35/4/2; <span class="font-italic">Lo Khi On (t/a Fuji Hairdressing Saloon) v Tanjo</span><span class="font-italic">ng Aru Hotel Sdn Bhd</span> [1994] 3 MLJ 766). Section 108 of the EA, as an exception to the general rule in s 103 of the EA that the party who asserts must prove, imposes on a person the burden of proving a fact where that fact was particularly within the knowledge of that person (see <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh s/o Jagdish Singh</span><span class="font-italic"> and another (administrators of the estate of Narindar Kaur d/o Sarwan Singh, deceased) v Li Man Kay and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 428 at [217]). In the present case, the account had been ordered on a wilful default basis, and the onus was upon the Brothers to explain the accounts. The relevant facts were peculiarly within their own knowledge. It was appropriate for them to furnish such explanations as they had at the outset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In stating the above, I acknowledge that the parties’ respective burdens of proof with regard to the reliefs of surcharge and falsification must be taken into consideration when determining the merits of the parties’ contentions. Where a beneficiary seeks to surcharge a common account, the beneficiary bears the burden of showing that the trustee received more income than that which the account records. On the other hand, where a beneficiary seeks to falsify an entry in the account, the trustee or fiduciary bears the burden of proving that that disbursement was in fact an authorised one (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [78]–[79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Having dealt with these preliminary matters, I now turn to consider the first substantive issue, that of the Brothers’ remuneration as directors in the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Directors’ remuneration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Brothers are directors at the Companies in which the Estate has shareholdings. The Sisters’ position is that the Brothers should account for all the remuneration they received as directors of the Companies in which the Estate had shareholding because they did not disclose their conflict of interest.

</div> Their premise is that a fiduciary who gains unauthorised profits within the scope of their duty is obliged to account for those profits to their beneficiary. Because a principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary, a fiduciary ought not to place himself in a position where his interest and duty conflict.

They claim an account of profits, or in the alternative, equitable compensation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On the other hand, the Brothers deny that the Estate is entitled to their remuneration. They contend that they received the remuneration in their capacity as directors of the Companies, rather than in their capacity as executors.

This means that the Engs did not find themselves in a position to award themselves fees by virtue of their position as fiduciaries.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">225  Indeed, the decision of Harman J in <span class="font-italic">Re Gee</span> [1948] Ch 284 bears noting. There, Harman J observed at 295 that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it appears not to be the law that every man who becomes a trustee holding as such shares in a limited company is made ipso facto accountable for remuneration received from that company independently of any use by him of the trust holding, whether by voting or refraining from so doing. For instance, A who holds the majority of the shares in a limited company becomes the trustee of the estate of B, a holder of a minority interest; this cannot, I think, disentitle A to use his own shares to procure his own appointment as an officer of the company, nor compel him to disgorge the remuneration he so receives, for he cannot be disentitled to the use of his own voting powers, nor could the use of the trust votes in a contrary sense prevent the majority prevailing. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">226 The present facts, to my mind, are also a case where the Engs could not have exploited their control over the Wees’ shareholding to vote themselves the fees, even if I accept that it is because they were fiduciaries to the Wees that they had the power to appoint directors or control the shareholding. I therefore do not take the view that the fees were obtained as a result of their fiduciary position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I reject the Brothers’ contentions for the following reasons. First, while the Brothers were indeed appointed as directors prior to their becoming executors, this does not exculpate them of any responsibility as fiduciaries after they became executors. It simply follows that the profits that the Brothers earned <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to their becoming executors would not be subject to an account of profits, and no request is made in this case concerning remuneration prior to their becoming executors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Second, the starting point is for fiduciaries to always seek informed consent when in a position of conflict. Here, the Brothers admitted during cross-examination that there was a conflict. <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Gee</span> and <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Chin</span>, which Mr Sreenivasan SC relies upon, may be distinguished. In <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Gee</span>, there appears to have been no conflict of interest. Harman J, on an examination of the facts, stated at 296 that the persons entitled to the benefit of the estate’s shares in that case were in favour of the appointment and the payment of the stipulated remuneration; and further, no suggestion was made that the remuneration was excessive or that the executors had acted in bad faith. In <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Chin</span>, Coomaraswamy J in disposing of the issue relating to the structuring fees did so on the basis that there was sufficient disclosure and informed consent. This is clear from the paragraph following the three paragraphs set out above at [39] (upon which Mr Sreenivasan SC relies), at [227]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">227 In any event, however, I find that the Engs gave sufficient disclosure, and moreover, received the Wees’ informed consent. The Engs highlighted multiple times to the Wees that such a fee was being negotiated, and moreover, informed the Wees when that fee was finally agreed. The relevant details of the fee, being the amount of 2.5% of the investment amount, was also disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Coming to the facts of this case, there were clearly actions taken in conflict of interest <span class="font-italic">without</span> the informed consent of the beneficiaries. The conflict of interest arose because the directors’ remuneration and the dividends payable to shareholders came from the same pool of funds. The Companies owned valuable properties that were sold or for which acquisition compensation was given. These proceeds could have been channelled either into directors’ remuneration or dividends. The quarries held by [A] Trading, for example, were compulsorily acquired by the government in 1998 with a gain of $16,895,000. A supplementary award in 2001 for compulsory acquisition by the government resulted in a further gain of $21,100,000. These gains were accumulated in the reserves of [A] Trading but were reduced by substantial net losses in 1999, 2000, and 2002 to 2007. A property owned by [A] Trading was sold in 2010 with a gain of $21,788,610 $5,031,632 was diverted as remuneration in 2010. Director salaries were tripled such that between 2011 and 2015, the remuneration to directors amounted to about $1.3m per year despite low levels of income, resulting in net losses: for example, $695,000 in 2011, $575,000 in 2015. UVJ admitted in cross-examination that the interest of the directors would lie in higher bonuses, while the Sisters’ interest would lie in higher dividends.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my judgment, it was the very fact of non-disclosure that allowed the Brothers to draw down on the proceeds of properties sold by the company. Shareholder approval in this particular company was a foregone conclusion because those voting were receiving the remuneration voted upon. Thus, [A] Trading could submit the IR8A tax declaration form in January 2011 for the payment of a $863,000 bonus to the first defendant prior to its approval at the relevant AGM in July 2011.

</div>
</div> Further, it was the non-disclosure that allowed continuation of the remuneration for many years. Despite the Estate’s small shareholding, the Sisters would not be without remedy if they did not agree with the vote: for instance, they could have had recourse to s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) under a claim for minority oppression. The continuation of the Brothers’ misconduct was permitted by the non-disclosure, which has had significant practical effect. Cross-examination revealed that there were no contracts of employment or any documents delineating their scope of work as directors. The Brothers’ remuneration bore no relation to the work done within the Companies. For example, in Financial Year 2010, [A] Trading paid UVJ the sum of $863,000 as a bonus although he was fully employed as a senior executive elsewhere. Amongst the salaries which escalated in 2011 was the near doubling of the salary of one Mr Lee, a man who was at the time 90 years of age, had not visited the office for a number of years, and who passed away the next year in 2012.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I should make clear three matters for completeness. First, the Brothers contended at various points that the Sisters had deprived themselves of their rights by their decision to refrain from questioning the Brothers until after their Mother’s death.

</div> Counsel clarified when asked that he is not advancing any case of estoppel. There is no merit in this argument. Any knowledge the Sisters may have had that they were beneficiaries at the time is irrelevant to the responsibility of the Brothers. Full and frank disclosure of all relevant matters is the requisite standard (see <span class="font-italic">Murad</span> at [71]). The Brothers clearly failed to meet this standard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Second, while the Brothers have sought to argue that their remuneration is in line with salaries earned in the field of private equity,

</div>
</div> this was not the role they performed as directors. The evidence provided by the Brothers’ expert witness, Mr Sim, on private equity salaries is therefore irrelevant. Further, any question of their remuneration being reasonable only arises if the court is of the view that they should be given an equitable allowance. The granting of an equitable allowance is the exception, not the norm (see <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> at [23]). It is for the fiduciary to establish that it would be inequitable to order an account of one’s entire profits (see <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> at [28]). There are no facts upon which to make such an order. The Brothers have not shown themselves to be honest fiduciaries nor have they done work for the Estate. Quite the opposite. They remained responsible for the Estate’s shareholding in the Companies because they had not distributed the shares. Having omitted to distribute the shares, they were responsible to keep the beneficiaries informed and to act in the beneficiaries’ best interest. Drawing down the proceeds of the property proceeds through directors’ remuneration was not in the best interests of the beneficiaries. In any event, once their remuneration is paid back into the Estate, they will receive a share of the same as beneficiaries of the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Third, the Brothers contend that the rule against reflective loss applies to bar the Sisters’ claim for an account of profits.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-352ddacc-12b9-4306-8b0d-7d9ba2561a1e" data-toggle="modal" type="button">47</button></sup>

</div> The principle of reflective loss dictates that a claim will not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss which would be made good if the company’s assets were replenished through action by the company against the party responsible for the loss (see <span class="font-italic">To</span><span class="font-italic">wnsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(in liquidation)</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 597 at [69]). But the profits claimed here are not owed to the Companies. The Sisters claim in their capacity as beneficiaries, for the Brothers to disgorge the wrongful profits they obtained while acting in breach of their fiduciary duties. The premise of the account to the beneficiaries is to ensure that the defaulting fiduciary does not retain the profit. The rule against reflective loss has no applicability in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 An account of the Brothers’ profits in terms of the remuneration earned is therefore owed to the Estate.

</div>. Mdm Kok’s daughter was an employee of one of the Companies at the time of his passing. These facts support the Brothers’ contention that the Testator wished for Mdm Kok to remain at the Eastern Mansion property rent-free until the en bloc sale. Importantly, I note that the Brothers would possess a financial incentive to rent out the Eastern Mansion property, as they too would have benefitted by virtue of their position as beneficiaries of the late Testator’s Estate. Their interests aligned with those of their Sisters on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Notwithstanding, the Brothers, as part of their responsibility as executors to keep beneficiaries informed, ought to have kept the Sisters apprised with regard to the affairs of the Eastern Mansion property, and they did not. I am of the view, nevertheless, that had they done so, the Sisters would in all probability have agreed with this course of action. Their Mother was still alive during this period, and even if they disagreed with the Testator’s preference, such a decision would have minimised embarrassment to their Mother. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It is not disputed that the standard that executors should be held to is that of good faith and reasonableness (see <span class="font-italic">ADP v ADT</span> [2014] 3 SLR 904 at [10]).

Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Jigarlal</span> <span class="font-italic">Kantilal Doshi v Damayanti Kantilal Doshi</span><span class="font-italic"> (executrix of the estate of Kantilal Prabhulal Doshi, deceased)</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 290, the Court of Appeal held at [12] that any evidence of misconduct on the part of the executors that demonstrates “undue and improper administration of the estate in total disregard of the interests of the beneficiaries” would be sufficient to revoke probate under s 32 of the Probate and Administration Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Sisters had established, even at the time of summary judgment for the account to be taken, the Brothers’ failure to distribute assets despite the absence of a power to postpone distribution, and the failure to furnish any account of their actions to the beneficiaries for a lengthy period of years.

</div> It was conceded at closing submissions that a regular account from the Brothers as fiduciaries, that the Sisters would have been entitled to as beneficiaries, would have included items such as the status of the Eastern Mansion property, the JB Land, and the shares of all the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The taking of accounts has also now established further breaches. Ignoring their core duty of loyalty and fidelity, the Brothers have omitted to distribute dividends and the shares held by the Estate without any reasonable justification.

</div> At the time of the summary hearing, the Brothers contended that the market had not recovered from the financial crisis until 2004, which was when they distributed the pecuniary bequests to their Half-Siblings. Nonetheless, their obligation commenced with the grant of probate in 2000, and during cross-examination at the taking of accounts, they were unable to furnish any good reason why they had not distributed the Estate shares <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>. Doing so would not have required cash. The Sisters’ component of the Estate shares was also small: they could have valued and then purchased the Sisters’ shares. Despite the small number of the shares, the substantial real estate portfolios the Companies held would have made the shares valuable. But whether in cash or <span class="font-italic">in specie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> no distribution was contemplated up to the time this suit was filed. Their contention was that of oversight because they were not professional executors. This contention is disingenuous considering that UVJ has held multiple senior corporate positions. The executors would well have known that it was incumbent on them to seek and follow legal advice, as they had for OS 1241/2002. Excuses proffered ranged from needing funds to maintain the JB Land, to requiring money to develop the JB Land, to engaging in a joint venture with a third party in respect of the JB Land. In truth, attempt at either form of distribution of the shares, whether in cash or <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>, would have alerted the Sisters to their share in a valuable stable of companies. The Brothers’ purpose was to keep their Sisters uninformed, in order to continue to extract value from the Companies in their capacity as directors. In so doing, they have acted in conflict with, and to the detriment of, their Sisters’ interest. A new executor, or executors, as the case may be, are appropriate to ensure a timely and proper realisation and distribution of the assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For clarity, and Mr Jeyaretnam SC also confirmed at the hearing, in view of the facts shown during the account which necessitate the removal and replacement of the Brothers as executors, clause 4 of the Order of Court (which requires the Brothers to pay to the Sisters the amount found to be due to them on the taking of such account) is no longer necessary. As the Estate is not yet fully administered, the beneficiaries have no equitable or beneficial interest in any particular asset comprised in the unadministered estate (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased)</span> <span class="font-italic">v Soo Ah Choy </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 27 at [11]), theirs is the right in appropriate circumstances to institute action to protect the estate: see <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn</span><span class="font-italic"> Carolyn v Kao Chai-Chau Linda and others </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1018 at [8]–[16]. It should be for the new executor/s to call in the assets and then decide on the distribution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In conclusion, I agree with the Sisters on the issue of the directors’ remuneration, the benefits in kind arising from occupation of [E] and [F] Shelford Road, the $1m entry as the Mother’s debt, the legal fees arising out of OS 1241/2002, and the removal of the present executors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Regarding the replacement of the executors, the Sisters have put forward two alternative names. The Brothers, in view of their opposition, have not given thought to the names or whether there should be single or co-executors. I will hear counsel on the fresh executor/s to be appointed. I shall also hear counsel on interest, costs and the form of the judgment to be drawn up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Philip Jeyaretnam SC and Reuben Gavin Peter (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>N Sreenivasan SC and Lim Shu Fen (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law Practice LLC) for the first to third defendants;<br/>Dr G Raman (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the fourth to sixth defendants.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
