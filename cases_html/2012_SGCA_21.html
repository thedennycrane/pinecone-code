        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of decision of
                the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the
                    decision of the judge (“the Judge”) in <em>State Bank of India
                        Singapore v Rainforest Trading Ltd and another</em> [2011] 4 SLR 699
                    (“the Judgment”). We dismissed the appeal and now give the detailed grounds for
                    our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts relevant to the
                    resolution of this appeal are not disputed (see the Judgment at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>–<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>) and
                    are set out briefly below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent is a banking
                    institution governed and regulated by the Monetary Authority of
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The First Appellant is a company
                    incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The Second Appellant is a private
                    company incorporated in Singapore and a wholly owned subsidiary of the First
                    Appellant. Mr Vikas Goel (“Mr Goel”) was previously the majority shareholder of
                    the Second Appellant (see below at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>),
                    holding 99.99% of the issued share capital of the Second
                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Teledata Informatics Limited
                    (“Teledata”) is a publicly listed company incorporated in India.
                    Mr P K Padmanabhan (“Mr Padmanabhan”) is the founder and managing director of
                    Teledata.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Baytech Inc (“Baytech”) is a
                    company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and is a wholly owned
                    subsidiary of Teledata.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Facility Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 10 November 2006, Teledata
                    expressed to the Second Appellant its interest in investing in the Second
                    Appellant. A share subscription agreement (“SSA”) dated 29 November 2006 was
                    entered into between Mr Goel, the Second Appellant and Teledata.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The SSA basically provided for
                    a share swap arrangement. The First Appellant was to be incorporated for the
                    purposes of the SSA. Mr Goel was to transfer his majority shareholding in the
                    Second Appellant to the First Appellant in return for a 49% shareholding in the
                    First Appellant. Teledata would invest approximately US$65m in equity in the
                    First Appellant and would extend a further loan of US$40m to the First
                    Appellant. The First Appellant would, in turn, use the monies and extend loans
                    of up to US$60m to the Second Appellant. After payment of the requisite sums,
                    Teledata would hold 51% of the shares in the First Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The SSA was subsequently amended
                    four times.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Under the amended SSA, Baytech was
                    to be appointed as Teledata’s nominee for the purposes of subscribing to shares
                    in the First Appellant pursuant to the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Around December 2006, Teledata
                    decided to obtain financing from the Respondent. Upon the conclusion of
                    negotiations, the Respondent entered into a Facility Agreement dated 22 February
                    2007 (“the Facility Agreement”) with Baytech.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Under the Facility Agreement, the
                    Respondent agreed, <em>inter alia</em>, to provide a US$80m
                    loan facility to Baytech. Clause 3.1 of the Facility Agreement states that the
                    purpose of the Facility Agreement was for Baytech to use the monies borrowed
                    under the Facility to obtain majority shareholding in the Second Appellant by
                    acquisition of 51% of the shares in the First Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Numerous securities were
                    provided to the Respondent pursuant to clause 4 of the Facility Agreement.
                    Crucially, under clause 4(vi) of the Facility Agreement, 10,200,000 shares in
                    the Second Appellant (representing 51% of the Second Appellant’s share capital)
                    (“the Pledged Shares”) were to be “pledged” by the First Appellant to the
                    Respondent. Clause 4(vi) states as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>4</b>
                
              <b>Security</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The facility shall be secured by the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">vi)    Pledge of 51% of the paid up share capital of [the
                            Second Appellant] to be acquired out of the facility, which pledge shall
                            be completed and duly registered as a charge in favour of the Lender
                            within 30 days of the execution of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Pledged Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 23 February 2007, Baytech
                    fully drew down on the US$80 million facility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     By a letter dated 5 April 2007
                    addressed to the Respondent,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> the First Appellant
                    delivered 5 share certificates representing the Pledged Shares (“the Share
                    Certificates”) to the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The First
                    Appellant also sent a signed blank share transfer form with a cover letter dated
                    5 April 2007 to the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Second Appellant
                    sent a letter to the Respondent on 5 April 2007, indicating that it had noted
                    the Respondent’s interest in the Register of Members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> On
                    10 December 2007, the First Appellant and Baytech each registered a charge over
                    the Pledged Shares in favour of the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Subsequently, Baytech failed to
                    make payment on US$13 million due and owing to the Respondent on 20 February
                    2009. By a letter dated 25 March 2010 to Baytech, the Respondent declared that
                    an event of default had occurred under the Facility Agreement and that all
                    outstanding sums became immediately due and payable within seven days of receipt
                    of that letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Baytech did not pay within the
                    prescribed period. The Respondent sought to enforce its security over the
                    Pledged Shares by commencing Originating Summons No 958 of 2010 (“the
                    OS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The parties involved in the
                    present dispute have also commenced proceedings against or with each other in
                    other jurisdictions. It should be noted that the Respondent is not involved in
                    any of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the course of proceedings in
                    India, Mr Padmanabhan filed an affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> exhibiting a version of the
                        SSA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and claimed in his affidavit that this
                    version was the basis for the Facility Agreement. The Appellants claim that they
                    first became aware of this version of the SSA through this affidavit and that
                    this version of the SSA was a forgery. The Appellants allege that Teledata
                    submitted this version to the Respondent to obtain the Facility Agreement, and
                    the Respondent was put on notice and was complicit in an alleged fraud
                    perpetrated on the Appellants. The Appellants argued that the OS should be
                    converted to a writ Action because of these allegations of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Judge refused to convert the
                    OS to a writ Action (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> of the
                    Judgment). He opined that, upon consideration of the allegations of fraud made
                    by the Appellants, there was no reason why the matter could not be disposed of
                    through the OS. He comprehensively addressed and rejected the Appellants’
                    various allegations of fraud (see [47]–[77] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge held that an equitable
                    mortgage carrying an implied power of sale was created over the Pledged Shares
                    in favour of the Respondent through the deposit of the Share Certificates and
                    the signed blank share transfer form with the Respondent. An event of default
                    had occurred under the Facility Agreement and the Respondent could therefore
                    exercise its power of sale in compliance with the Second Appellant’s articles of
                    association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Consequently, the Judge granted
                    the following declarations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     An event of default
                        had occurred pursuant to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        clause 21 of the Facility Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Respondent was entitled to enforce its
                        security by selling the Pledged Shares subject to the provisions of the
                        Second Appellant’s articles of association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Judge directed that a
                    valuation of the Pledged Shares was to be conducted and that the parties were to
                    agree on the joint appointment of an independent auditor within three weeks of
                    4 August 2011 and, failing such agreement, the parties were at liberty to seek
                    the court’s assistance to appoint an auditor on behalf of the parties. The Judge
                    awarded the costs of the OS to the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellants’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellants appealed against
                    the Judge’s decision on two points. Firstly, they argued that the equitable
                    mortgage over the Pledged Shares was invalid and unenforceable because the
                    consideration provided for the mortgage was past consideration. This is a new
                    point that was not raised before the Judge. Secondly, the Appellants argued that
                    the OS should be converted to a writ Action and that the Judge was wrong in not
                    allowing a conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In so far as the first point was
                    concerned, the Appellants argued that the equitable mortgage was not supported
                    by valid consideration and was hence invalid. The consideration furnished by the
                    Respondent, namely the entrance into the Facility Agreement or alternatively the
                    disbursement of the loan, was past consideration because the equitable mortgage
                    was created on 5 April 2007, after the Respondent entered into the Facility
                    Agreement on 22 February 2007 and the loan facility was fully drawn down on
                    23 February 2007. The exception to the rule against past consideration
                    established in the Hong Kong Privy Council decision of <em>Pao On
                        and others v Lau Yiu Long and others</em> [1980] AC 614 (“<em>Pao On</em>”) was not applicable on the facts. In particular,
                    the first and second conditions of the exception were not established on the
                    facts of the case. The grant of and entrance into the loan facility by the
                    Respondent was not done at the request of the First Appellant. The First
                    Appellant was never involved in any negotiations or discussions regarding the
                    loan facility and had no dealings with the Respondent before 5 April 2007, when
                    the Share Certificates and signed blank share transfer form were deposited with
                    the Respondent. There was no understanding between the First Appellant and the
                    Respondent when the Facility Agreement was entered into and when the loan
                    facility was fully drawn down that the First Appellant would grant the equitable
                    mortgage to the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In so far as the second point
                    was concerned, the Appellants submitted, firstly, that disputes of fact and
                    triable issues exist as to whether the First Appellant intended to create an
                    equitable mortgage over the Pledged Shares as well as to the exact nature and
                    extent of the security provided by the First Appellant. Secondly, a perusal of
                    the version of the SSA obtained from the Indian proceedings alone should have
                    put the Respondent on notice. Thirdly, the issue as to whether there had been
                    complicity on the part of the Respondent with Teledata in relation to the
                    allegedly forged SSA was a matter that called for further enquiry. Fourthly,
                    there were substantial disputes of fact, allegations of fraud or both and the
                    court ought therefore to convert the OS to a writ Action. The Appellants relied
                    on <em>Woon Brothers Investments Pte Ltd v Management Corporation
                        Strata Title Plan No 461 and others</em> [2011] 4 SLR 777 (“<em>Woon Brothers</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In so far as the first point was
                    concerned, the Respondent argued that valid consideration had been provided by
                    the Respondent. Clause 4(vi) of the Facility Agreement clearly provided that the
                    equitable mortgage over the Pledged Shares was to be created within 30 days of
                    the execution of the Facility Agreement. Hence, the parties intended that the
                    equitable mortgage be created only after the loan facility was drawn down and
                    the funds were used to acquire the shares in the Second Appellant. The delivery
                    of the Share Certificates and signed blank share transfer form was part of the
                    same transaction as the Facility Agreement. The contemporaneous letters that
                    accompanied the Share Certificates and signed blank share transfer form
                    supported this as they demonstrated that the Appellants intended to, and did,
                    create the equitable mortgage with reference to the Facility Agreement and the
                    equitable mortgage was part of the same transaction as the Facility Agreement.
                    The consideration provided by the Respondent was therefore not past
                    consideration. The Respondent relied on <em>Sim Tony v Lim Ah
                        Ghee (trading as Phil Real Estate &amp; Building Services)</em> [1994]
                    2 SLR(R) 910 (“<em>Sim Tony HC</em>”) and <em>Sim Tony v Lim Ah Ghee (trading as Phil Real Estate &amp; Building
                        Services)</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 886 (“<em>Sim Tony
                        CA</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In so far as the second point
                    was concerned, the Respondent submitted that it was clear law that a deposit of
                    share certificates created an equitable mortgage of the shares. The question of
                    the exact nature of the security created over the Pledged Shares was one of law
                    which could be decided without a trial on the facts. The Appellants had
                    conflated the legal issue of the nature of the security created by the deposit
                    of the Share Certificates with the factual issue of what the parties’ intentions
                    were at the material time. At any rate, the contemporaneous documents
                    surrounding the deposit of the Share Certificates demonstrated that the parties
                    had intended to create an equitable mortgage over the Pledged Shares. The
                    Appellants had not alleged that the Respondent was complicit in, or had
                    knowledge of, the alleged forgery of the SSA. The Appellants’ argument that
                    patent errors in the version of the SSA relied upon in the Indian proceedings
                    would have put the Respondent on notice was purely speculative. The Appellants
                    had not addressed the Judge’s findings, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, that no evidence had been adduced to demonstrate that the
                    Respondent received the original SSA and that the execution of the SSA was not a
                    condition precedent to the Facility Agreement. The Respondent’s unequivocal
                    evidence was that its decision to enter into the Facility Agreement was not
                    premised on the SSA. The Respondent distinguished <em>Woon
                        Brothers</em> on the basis that the Respondent’s case was
                    straightforward and that the mere assertion of fraud cannot justify the
                    conversion of an originating summons into a writ Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The issues before this court
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was valid
                        consideration given for the equitable mortgage over the Pledged

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Past consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Turning first to the issue of
                    past consideration, this was clearly an argument that had not been raised before
                    the Judge in the court below. Counsel for the Appellants, Mr Samuel Chacko
                    (“Mr Chacko”), sought to introduce this argument pursuant to O 57 r 13(4) of the
                    rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). The general principles governing
                    such a situation were set out by this court in <em>Ang Sin Hock v
                        Khoo Eng Lim</em> [2010] 3 SLR 179 (at [61]–[62]):</p>

                            generally refrain from entertaining a new point on appeal, particularly

                                ought to be most jealously scrutinised. The conduct of a cause at
                                the trial is governed by, and the questions asked of the witnesses
                                are directed to, the points then suggested. And it is obvious that
                                no care is exercised in the elucidation of facts not material to

                                apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">When a question of law is raised for the first time in a court of

                                expediency of adopting that course may be doubted, when the plea
                                cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact, in
                                considering which the Court of ultimate review is placed in a much

                                doubt that the facts, if fully investigated, would have supported

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Applying the principles set out
                    in the preceding paragraph, we were of the view that this court was in just as
                    advantageous a position as the court below to consider this particular issue. It
                    was also clear that no new evidence was required to be adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Turning to the substantive issue
                    proper, there was a fundamental – and fatal – flaw in the Appellants’ argument.
                    It was fundamentally inconsistent for Mr Chacko to advance the argument that the
                    equitable mortgage granted over the Pledged Shares should be unenforceable
                    because the consideration provided was past, while stating simultaneously that
                    the First Appellant had no negotiations and discussions with the Respondent
                    whatsoever. If, as Mr Chacko argued, the First Appellant had nothing whatsoever
                    to do with the Respondent, then this particular argument must fail since any
                    argument based on past consideration must necessarily be premised on what would
                    otherwise have been a separate contractual relationship between, <em>inter alia</em>, the First Appellant and the Respondent.
                    Indeed, although there was no evidence of an express contract between the
                    Appellants and the Respondent (as would traditionally be the case in the context
                    of a guarantee), an implied contract with the Respondent would also falsify the
                    First Appellant’s claim that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the
                    Respondent. At this juncture, any argument based on past consideration would
                    fail because, as we shall see in a moment, the doctrine of past consideration
                    would not apply and the exception to the rule against past consideration
                    established in <em>Pao On</em> would apply instead. Indeed,
                    the analysis proffered below would apply <em>equally</em>
                    to the situation where there was an express contract between the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The doctrine of past
                    consideration and the exception to the rule against past consideration
                    established in <em>Pao On</em> are clearly a part of
                    Singapore law (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Sim
                        Tony HC</em> and <em>Sim Tony CA</em>). A concise
                    summary and exposition of the law in this area particularly in relation to the
                    conditions of the <em>Pao On</em> exception is found in the
                    decision of this court in <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence
                        Peter and another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [83]–[84]
                        (“<em>Gay Choon Ing</em>”), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">83    It should also be
                            noted that an absence of linkage between the parties can also occur if
                            the consideration is <em>past</em> – hence, the
                            oft-cited principle that “past consideration is no consideration”.
                            However, the courts look to the substance rather than the form. Hence,
                            what looks at first blush like past consideration will still pass legal
                            muster if there is, in effect, a <em>single</em>
                            (contemporaneous) transaction (the common understanding of the parties
                            being that consideration would indeed be furnished at the time the
                            promisor made his or her promise to the promisee). This was established
                            as far back as the 1615 English decision of <em>Lampleigh
                                v Braithwait</em> (1615) Hob 105; 80 ER 255 and, whilst often
                            referred to as an exception to the principle, is not really an exception
                            for (as just stated) its application results in what is, in substance, a
                            single transaction to begin with. A somewhat more recent decision is
                            that of the English Court of Appeal in <em>In re Casey’s
                                Patents</em> [1892] 1 Ch 104, and a modern statement of this
                            particular legal principle can be found in the Hong Kong Privy Council
                            decision of [<em>Pao On</em>], where Lord Scarman,
                            delivering the judgment of the Board, observed thus
                        (at 629):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An Act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to
                            confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the
                            promise. <em>The Act must have been done at the
                                promisors’ request: the parties must have understood that the Act
                                was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some
                                other benefit: and payment, or the conferment of a benefit, must
                                have been legally enforceable had it been promised in
                                advance</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">84    The element of request (see above at [82]) may also
                            be usefully noted. It bears mention that the statement of principle in
                                <em>Pao On</em> quoted in the preceding
                            paragraph has, in fact, been affirmed in the local context. Indeed, in
                            the Singapore High Court decision of [<em>Sim Tony
                                HC</em>], Lai Siu Chiu J also referred to this particular
                            statement of principle (at [51]) as being “one <em>apparent</em> exception” [emphasis added] to the general rule
                            that past consideration cannot constitute sufficient consideration in
                            law. This court affirmed Lai J’s decision and endorsed her view to the
                            effect that a court should not take <em>a strict view
                                from literal chronology</em> in ascertaining whether the
                            consideration concerned was past: see [<em>Sim Tony
                                CA</em>], especially at [16].</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the circumstances, we saw no
                    reason why the conditions laid down in <em>Pao On</em> (as
                    cited in the preceding paragraph) would not be satisfied on the facts before us.
                    Put simply, the very nature of the contractual relationship between the
                    Appellants and the Respondent viewed in its context would necessarily assume
                    that there was both a request by the Appellants that the Respondent enter into
                    the Facility Agreement with Baytech and that there was a common understanding
                    between the parties that this (entry into the Facility Agreement by the
                    Respondent) would be compensated for by, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the grant of an equitable mortgage over the Pledged Shares
                    by the First Appellant – which would, of course, fulfil the aforementioned first
                    and second conditions. Clause 4(vi) of the Facility Agreement (set out above at
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>) clearly demonstrates that the
                    equitable mortgage over the Pledged Shares was to be granted pursuant to and
                    only after the entrance into and execution of the Facility Agreement. Indeed,
                    both of the Appellants’ letters dated 5 April 2007 addressed to the Respondent
                    in relation to the deposit of the Pledged Shares with the latter as well as the
                    cover letter dated 5 April 2007 accompanying the signed blank share transfer
                    form sent by the First Appellant to the Respondent serve to underscore (and,
                    more importantly, confirm) this analysis. The letter dated 5 April 2007 sent by
                    the First Appellant to the Respondent clearly demonstrates in unequivocal terms
                    that the First Appellant deposited the Share Certificates pursuant to the

<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Syndicated Term Loan of US$80
                            Million availed by [Baytech]– Facility Agreement

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>As one of the securities for the above loan</em>,
                        we had tendered to you five share certificates (representing 10.2 million
                        shares) issued by [the Second Appellant] for in favour of [the First

                        form duly signed. Please acknowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was hence clear beyond peradventure that the Appellants understood, as the
                    Respondent did, that the deposit of the Share Certificates and signed blank
                    share transfer form was made pursuant to the Facility Agreement. It also bears
                    emphasising that, by the very nature of the contract between the parties, the
                    grant of an equitable mortgage over the Pledged Shares by the First Appellant
                    could only have taken place after the entry by the Respondent into the Facility
                    Agreement with Baytech. The substance and reality of the matter is that the
                    relevant consideration and promise constituted part of a single transaction
                    between the parties. We therefore accepted the Respondent’s arguments on this
                    point. On a more general (and practical) level, the analysis just referred to
                    would be wholly consistent with the commercial purpose of all the contracts
                    concerned – a point that is also embodied in the letters referred to
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     That the Appellants fail here
                    does not mean that the Appellants had no other legal recourse in so far as the
                    present Action was concerned. This is not surprising in the least, for, as this
                    court has observed, the common law (and the allied principles of equity)
                    comprise “an <em>organic, coherent as well as holistic system out
                        of which justice and fairness flow</em>” (see the decision of this
                    court in <em>Kickapoo (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and another v The
                        Monarch Beverage Co (Europe) Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1212 at [57]
                    [emphasis in original]). However, these other legal routes would not find their
                    source in the law of contract. That this is the case is evident from the very
                    arguments proffered by the Appellants in the court below. For example, the
                    Appellants attempted to argue in the court below (and before this court) that
                    the Pledged Shares had been deposited pursuant to a fraudulent transaction (this
                    constitutes the crux of the second issue, <em>viz</em>,
                    whether the OS ought to be converted into a writ Action). They had also sought
                    to argue (unsuccessfully) in the court below (albeit not before this court) that
                    only a contractual lien instead of an equitable mortgage had resulted from the
                    deposit of the Share Certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Before proceeding to consider
                    (in the briefest of fashions, for the reasons set out below at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>–<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>) the
                    second issue in this appeal, it might be appropriate to proffer a few
                    observations on the doctrine of past consideration (<em>ie</em>, that past consideration is not valid consideration) as well
                    as the apparent exception to such a doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As is the case for the wider
                    umbrella doctrine of consideration that it falls under, the doctrine of past
                    consideration is (for better or worse) a firmly established part of both the
                    English and Singapore law of contract (see, <em>eg</em>,
                    the oft-cited English decisions of <em>Eastwood v
                        Kenyon</em> (1840) 11 Ad &amp; E 438; 113 ER 482 (“<em>Eastwood v Kenyon</em>”); <em>Roscorla v
                        Thomas</em> (1842) 3 QB 234 (“<em>Roscorla v
                        Thomas</em>”); <em>In re McArdle, decd</em>
                    [1951] 1 Ch 669; as well as the decision of the Singapore courts in <em>Sim Tony HC</em> and <em>Sim Tony
                        CA</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The doctrine has the effect of
                    preventing an otherwise valid contract from being formed. For example, in
                        <em>Roscorla v Thomas</em>, the defendant promised the
                    plaintiff that the horse bought by the plaintiff from him was free from vice
                    only after the sale was completed. The court held that the guarantee was
                    unenforceable because consideration was past. The same result was arrived at on
                    similar facts in <em>Thorner v Field</em> (1611) 1 Bulst
                    120; 80 ER 816. Similarly, in <em>Eastwood v Kenyon</em>, a
                    promise made by a young woman’s husband to repay the loan previously taken out
                    by the woman’s guardian to pay for her maintenance and education and improve her
                    estate was held to be unenforceable because the consideration provided was
                    past.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Subsequent cases ameliorated the
                    potential harshness of the doctrine of past consideration. In particular, an
                    apparent exception was created and has its genesis in the old English decision
                    of <em>Lampleigh v Braithwait</em> (1615) Hob 105; 80 ER
                    255. In that case, the promisor was accused of a crime and subsequently asked
                    the promisee to procure a king’s pardon for him, which the latter did at
                    considerable expense and effort. In gratitude, the promisor then promised to pay
                    the promisee a certain sum of money but failed to do so. The promisee sought to
                    enforce the promise. The court held that the promisee was entitled to enforce
                    the promise because even though the consideration was past in chronological
                    terms, the consideration (that is, the procurement of the pardon) was provided
                    at the request of the promisor. This case was followed in the subsequent English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>In re Casey’s
                        </em><em>Patents</em> [1892] 1 Ch 104. In that
                    case, the joint owners of certain patents promised the manager who previously
                    worked on the patents a one-third share of the patents. The court held that the
                    promise was enforceable since it was understood that at the time the previous
                    work on the patents was rendered it was to be subsequently paid for and the
                    subsequent promise to pay merely fixed the amount to be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The exception was given its
                    modern restatement in <em>Pao On</em> (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>) and has been received as a part of
                    our law (see <em>Sim Tony CA</em> and <em>Sim Tony HC</em>). As suggested in <em>Gay Choon
                        Ing</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>), it
                    is eminently arguable that this exception, upon further analysis, is not a true
                    exception, for the element of request establishes a link between the
                    consideration and promise which results in what is in substance one single
                    contemporaneous transaction between the parties. Interestingly, it has also been
                    observed that the seminal English decision of <em>Williams v
                        Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</em> [1991] 1 QB 1 (which
                    introduced the concept of “practical benefit” constituting good consideration)
                    has made further inroads into the doctrine of past consideration but only in the
                    context of a past, <em>executory</em> promise since “it is
                    now arguable that Actual performance or even an increased chance of performance
                    of that past promise confers practical benefits and [thereby] imports valid
                    consideration” (see Mindy Chen-Wishart, “Consideration: Practical Benefit and
                    the Emperor’s New Clothes” in <em>Good Faith and Fault in
                        Contract Law</em> (Jack Beatson &amp; Daniel Friedmann eds) (New York:
                    Oxford University Press, 1995) at p 139).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     If there is a unifying,
                        <em>practical</em> theme emerging from a consideration
                    of the exception (as well as observation) discussed above, it would appear to us
                    to be that, while the doctrine of past consideration remains part of our law, it
                    would generally be difficult for a party to successfully argue that a perfectly
                    sensible and legitimate commercial transaction is unenforceable simply because
                    the consideration provided for the promise was past. It has already been
                    previously observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 594 at [139] that “[t]he modern approach in contract law requires very
                    little to find the existence of consideration” (this case was affirmed on
                    appeal, but without consideration of this particular point: see <em>Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2005] 1 SLR(R) 502). The courts are understandably (and justifiably) reluctant
                    to invalidate otherwise perfectly legitimate and valid commercial transactions
                    on as technical a basis as consideration. A strictly chronological approach in
                    determining whether consideration is past or not is deeply unrealistic and
                    unnecessarily restrictive; it also undermines the freedom of contracting parties
                    as well as the sanctity of commercial transactions. As mentioned already in
                        <em>Gay Choon Ing</em> at [83] (see above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>), the court looks to the substance rather
                    than the form of the transaction. If the earlier Act which is said to constitute
                    the consideration for the later promise is part of substantially one and the
                    same transaction and there was a common understanding between the parties that
                    the former was to be compensated for by the latter, the consideration is valid
                    and hence the later promise is enforceable, notwithstanding the fact that, in
                    strictly chronological terms, the consideration was provided before the promise
                    was made. This would often be the case for many commercial arrangements,
                    particularly loan transactions. Arguments based on past consideration will
                    invariably be looked upon by the courts with great circumspection and even
                    scepticism when they are raised in the context of legitimate, sensible and
                    commonplace commercial transactions, as was the case here. In this regard, we
                    agree that the doctrine of past consideration should not be allowed to introduce
                    “considerable incoherence into the law governing lenders and borrowers and …
                    frustrate normal business expectations” (see Mark B Wessman, “Should We Fire the
                    Gatekeeper? An Examination of the Doctrine of Consideration” (1993)
                    48 U Miami L Rev 45 at p 103).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The present legal position does,
                    in our view, strike the right balance between theory and practice. Indeed,
                    notwithstanding the trenchant criticisms of the doctrine of past consideration
                    stretching back almost seventy five years (see the UK Law Revision Committee,
                        <em>Sixth Interim Report (Statute of Frauds and the Doctrine
                        of Consideration)</em> (Cmd 5449, 1937) (“the 1937 Report”) at
                    paras 21 and 32), this doctrine is still very much part of the legal landscape
                    not only in Singapore but also in other jurisdictions where a different result
                    could in fact have been arrived at by the courts. In Malaysia, for example, a
                    strong argument could be made to the contrary. The language of s 2(<em>d</em>) of the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950 (Act 136)
                    (“Contracts Act”) might suggest – at first blush at least – that past
                    consideration could nevertheless constitute valid consideration in the eyes of
                    the law (see, <em>eg</em>, the Malaysian High Court
                    decision of <em>Guthrie Waugh Bhd v Malaippan
                        Muthuchumaru</em> [1972] 1 MLJ 35 at 39–40, <em>per</em> Sharma J, which was reversed in <em>Guthrie
                        Waugh Bhd v Malaiappan Muthuchumaru</em> [1972] 2 MLJ 62 but not on
                    this particular point which was apparently endorsed by at least one judge (see
                        <em>ibid at 6</em>7) and the Malaysian Privy Council
                    decision of <em>Kepong Prospecting Ltd &amp; Ors v
                        Schmidt</em> [1968] 1 MLJ 170). <em>However</em>,
                    in the more recent Malaysian Supreme Court decision of <em>South
                        East Asia Insurance Bhd v Nasir Ibrahim</em> [1992] 2 MLJ 355, s
                        2(<em>d</em>) was interpreted as recognising the
                    principles laid down at common law in <em>Pao On</em>
                    (reference may also be made to the Malaysian Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Wong Hon Leong David v Noorazman bin Adnan</em>
                    [1995] 3 MLJ 283; the Malaysian High Court decisions of <em>GBH
                        Ceramics Sdn Bhd v How It @ Low Aik &amp; Ors</em> [1989] 2 CLJ 427;
                        <em>Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation v Syarikat
                        United Leong Enterprise Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</em> [1993] 2 MLJ 449; and
                        <em>Affin Bank Berhad v Precision Tube Product (Malaysia) Sdn
                        Bhd &amp; Ors</em> [2010] MLJU 119; as well as <em>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract – Second Singapore and
                        Malaysian Edition</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1998) (“<em>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston</em>”) at pp 155–157 and Dato’ Seri
                    Visu Sinnadurai, <em>Law of Contract</em> (LexisNexis,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2011) vol 1 (“<em>Sinnadurai</em>”) at pp 160–165). That having been said, s
                        26(<em>b</em>) of the Contracts Act “may pose even
                    greater difficulties” (see <em>Cheshire, Fifoot and
                        Furmston</em> at p 157). However, it has been observed, in so far as
                    this particular provision is concerned, that “it would appear that recovery by
                    the promisee is not premised on the enforcement of a past consideration as such
                    but, rather, on a special (statutory) rule of <em>restitution</em>” (see <em>ibid</em> [emphasis
                    in original] as well as generally <em>ibid</em> at
                    pp 157–159 and <em>Sinnadurai</em> at
                pp 165–167).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Finally, it is interesting to
                    note that, had Lord Mansfield in <em>Pillans and Rose v Van
                        Mierop and Hopkins</em> (1765) 3 Burr 1663; 97 ER 1035 prevailed in
                    establishing <em>moral</em> consideration as constituting
                    sufficient consideration in law, the common law position today might well have
                    been different as it could, at least where the relevant facts were present, be
                    argued that an expression of gratitude, whilst constituting past consideration,
                    ought nevertheless be recognised pursuant to the concept of moral consideration
                    (see generally Lord Wright, “Ought the Doctrine of Consideration to be Abolished
                    from the Common Law?” (1936) 49 Harvard L Rev 1225 at pp 1239–1246;
                    Kevin M Teeven, <em>Promises on Prior Obligations at Common
                        Law</em> (Greenwood Press, 1998) (“<em>Teeven</em>”) at chh 7–11); and Koo Zhi Xuan, “Envisioning the
                    Judicial Abolition of the Doctrine of Consideration in Singapore” (2011)
                    23 SAcLJ 463 (“<em>Koo</em>”) at pp 472–476 and 487–488;
                    see also K C T Sutton, <em>Consideration Reconsidered – Studies
                        on the Doctrine of Consideration of the Law of Contract</em>
                    (University of Queensland Press, 1974) at pp 242–243, where, <em>inter alia</em>, the American position pursuant to the <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</em> (see the various
                    “exceptions” to past or moral consideration listed in <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">§</font>86) is also referred to and where a distinction is drawn
                    between cases involving mere gratitude or sentiment (which would <em>not</em> constitute sufficient consideration in law) and
                    those involving restitution (which would constitute sufficient consideration in
                    law; <em>cf</em> also, the preceding paragraph; the
                    comprehensive discussion in <em>Teeven</em> at chh 10 and
                    11; as well as Steve Thel &amp; Edward Yorio, “The Promissory Basis of Past
                    Consideration” (1992) 78 Virginia L Rev 1045, which argues for a promissory
                    (instead of restitutionary) basis of recovery instead). As a not altogether
                    irrelevant aside, it is significant, perhaps, that Lord Mansfield has been
                    described by one writer as being “a civilian at heart” (see <em>Teeven</em> at p 76; see also <em>ibid</em> at
                    pp 79 and 85), for the concept of moral consideration has never been a problem
                    in civil law countries (see <em>Koo</em> at pp 487–488).
                    However, the concept of moral consideration has been decisively rejected in
                    England (see, in particular, <em>Eastwood v Kenyon</em>;
                    the 1937 Report at para 19; as well as the perceptive analysis in <em>Teeven</em> at ch 8) and it is, in our view, too late to turn
                    the clock back, so to speak, in Singapore as well (see also the Singapore High
                    Court decision of <em>Re Low Gim Har Janet</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 208 at [162]–[163]). Nevertheless, given the principles laid down in
                        <em>Pao On</em> (which, in our view, are consistent
                    with logic, practicality and commonsense), this is by no means a crucial
                    setback. It ought to be pointed out (in addition to the modified position
                    adopted in America and which has just been alluded to in the briefest of
                    fashions) that the situation in Malaysia may – in this particular regard – be
                    somewhat different, having regard, in particular, to s 26(<em>a</em>) of the Contracts Act. This particular provision is, however,
                    not without difficulties, and the various issues that arise therefrom is outside
                    the purview of the present judgment (see generally <em>Cheshire,
                        Fifoot and Furmston</em> at pp 147–148 and <em>Sinnadurai</em> at pp 179–184, as well as the authorities cited in
                    both these works).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should the OS be converted to a writ Action?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This particular issue was dealt
                    with in meticulous detail by the Judge in the court below (see the Judgment at
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> and [47]–[77]). We agreed with the
                    reasons given by the Judge and found no merit whatsoever in the arguments
                    proffered by the Appellants to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At this point, we would like to
                    make some observations on converting an originating summons to a writ Action.
                    While it was stated by this court in <em>Woon Brothers</em>
                    at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> that a writ Action is usually more
                    appropriate when allegations of fraud are made, it <em>cannot</em> be the case that a conversion <em>must</em> be ordered the moment allegations of fraud are made by a
                    defendant, for this would allow defendants to unnecessarily prolong and
                    complicate otherwise straightforward and legitimate claims made against them,
                    which is precisely the case here. Mr Chacko is wrong to cite <em>Woon Brothers</em> for the overly broad proposition that an
                    originating summons <em>must</em> be converted the moment
                    there are allegations of substantial disputes of fact, allegations of fraud or
                    both. The alleged disputes of fact as well as allegations of fraud must be
                    accompanied by the existence of at least a credible matrix of facts and must be
                    relevant to the dispute at hand, which was not the case here.</p>
