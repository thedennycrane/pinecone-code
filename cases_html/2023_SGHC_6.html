The beneficial interest which the plaintiff claims is said to arise under or by reason of a written declaration of trust which the second defendant executed on 23 July 2015 (“the 2015 Trust Deed”). By the express terms of the 2015 Trust Deed, the second defendant declared that she held one-third of the shares in the third defendant on trust for the plaintiff. I shall refer to all of the shares in the third defendant from time to time and at any given time as “the Shares”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The first defendant opposes the plaintiff’s claim. His case is that the second defendant holds all the Shares on trust for the first defendant on a resulting trust. The resulting trust is said to arise from the first defendant’s payment: (a) to a law firm in Singapore of all the fees and disbursements necessary for the law firm to incorporate the third defendant; and (b) to the third defendant of all of the capital payable on the Shares upon its incorporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The second and third defendants take the position that the first defendant is the beneficial owner of all of the Shares.

They have, however, reserved their rights as to recovering the costs which they have incurred in this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 This action is therefore in substance entirely between the plaintiff and the first defendant.

In the course of her employment, she accepts appointment as a nominee director of companies which ILC incorporates for its clients. Some of ILC’s clients need a nominee director to satisfy s 145 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”). That section requires every company incorporated in Singapore to have at least one director who is resident in Singapore. The second defendant also accepts appointment as a nominee shareholder in companies which ILC incorporates for its clients. This is how the second defendant came to hold the Shares. She therefore accepts that she holds the Shares on trust and thus has no beneficial interest whatsoever in the Shares.

The third defendant’s incorporation documents name: (a) the second defendant as its initial and sole subscribing shareholder: and (b) the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant as its initial directors.

</div>
</div> The key point, however, is that the plaintiff did not remotely have the US$100m necessary to undertake the Project or even access to investors with that sort of capital.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Gluck brought to the Project his own capital but more importantly his access to the considerable further capital to make up the US$100m necessary to undertake the Project. The first defendant was the source of the further capital.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The first defendant brought to the Project his considerable capital.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In short, the plaintiff could not undertake the Project without Mr Gluck’s and the first defendant’s capital. And Mr Gluck could not undertake the Project without the plaintiff’s business connections in Sri Lanka and without the first defendant’s capital. And the first defendant could not undertake the Project without the plaintiff’s business connections.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Against this backdrop, the plaintiff, the first defendant and Mr Gluck had protracted negotiations from May 2015 up to December 2016 as to how the plaintiff would be compensated for his past and future contributions to the Project, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> his contributions in: (a) identifying the business opportunity and bringing it to the attention of Mr Gluck and, through him, to the attention of the first defendant; (b) taking the business opportunity forward to the point where the GOSL awarded the Project to his consortium; (c) launching the Project; and (d) running the Project once launched.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I have summarised the parties’ relative contributions to the Project (see [44] above). The important point, however, is that Mr Gluck and the first defendant are serial investors. The Project was not of especial significance to them. On the other hand, the Project was the principal substantial business opportunity which the plaintiff was pursuing at this time. This meant that, during all of these negotiations, all of the bargaining power rested with the first defendant and none with the plaintiff. In other words, the plaintiff was throughout a supplicant; and the first defendant was throughout in a position to walk away from the Project for any reason or for no reason. And Mr Gluck was in the middle: trying his best to put the plaintiff’s case to the first defendant and the first defendant’s case to the plaintiff in order to keep the Project together and moving forward.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 At certain times during these negotiations, the first defendant or Mr Gluck on his behalf indicated an intention to offer the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the Project and therefore a corresponding and proportionate share of its profits.

</div>
</div> But at other times, the first defendant or Mr Gluck on his behalf indicated an intention to compensate the plaintiff merely as an employee of the Project, perhaps even a well-paid employee, but with no proprietary interest in the Project and therefore no share of its profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Two points are clear about these three-way negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The first point is that the parties never agreed how the plaintiff would be compensated for his past and future contributions to the Project, whether in terms of a binding contract, whether in terms of a factual <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> falling short of a contract or even in terms of an understanding not rising to the level of a <span class="font-italic">consensus</span> <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span>. Any suggestion to the contrary was wholly unsustainable factually. That was clear on the affidavit evidence alone, well before trial. This is why I struck out all of the plaintiff’s claim against Mr Gluck and the first defendant apart from the claim now before me (see [11] above). The plaintiff did not appeal my order striking out his other claims. He thereby implicitly accepted that they were correctly struck out and should not proceed to trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The second point is connected to the first point. The reason the parties never agreed how the plaintiff was to be compensated was because, for the reasons I have already given (see [47] above), the bargaining power throughout the negotiations rested entirely and solely with the first defendant. Because of this, the plaintiff was prepared to continue his work on the Project even though he had reached no agreement in any sense of the word about his compensation for his past and future contributions to the Project. To put it simply, the plaintiff consciously ran the risk that nothing would ever be agreed and that all of his efforts would go uncompensated. That risk has eventuated. The plaintiff’s unhappiness at being uncompensated is at the root of this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It is against the context supplied by these findings that I now turn to consider the issues I have identified (see [41] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Resulting trust over the Subscriber Shares </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The first issue is whether the second defendant held the Subscriber Shares on a presumed resulting trust for the first defendant. On this issue, I find in the first defendant’s favour largely for the reasons which he advances (see [34] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The presumption of resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 If one person (B) furnishes the consideration for property and directs that the property be conveyed to another person (T), and if B later claims that T holds the property on resulting trust for B, the first question is whether there is any clear evidence that B intended to make a gift of the property to T (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [52]). If there is such evidence, the inquiry ends there. B has made a gift of the property to T. T is the owner of the property at law. Equity follows the law. There is simply no scope for equity to intervene in B’s favour. T’s ownership is absolute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 If there is no clear evidence of B’s donative intent in favour of T, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> if the available evidence is unsatisfactory or equivocal, the court will apply the evidential presumption of resulting trust (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [52], citing <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 at [116]). This presumption, as well as the presumption of advancement, should be treated as “an evidential instrument of last resort” (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [59], affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [50]–[51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 One of the circumstances in which equity will presume a resulting trust to arise is indeed in the hypothetical I have posited (see [54] above): <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when B furnishes the consideration for property and directs that it be conveyed to T (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [34] endorsing Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669). The effect in equity of these circumstances (and the other circumstances which give rise to the presumption) is to presume that T’s legal title to the property has been separated from the beneficial interest in it, which results, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> springs back, to B. As the Court of Appeal held more recently in <span class="font-italic">Koh </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Chye and another v Koh Ah Leng and another and another appeal </span>[2021] SGCA 69 (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Where there is no relationship between the parties, it is presumed that the payer or the transferor intended to retain the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to his financial contributions toward the acquisition of the property.</span> This is the presumption of resulting trust and it constitutes the transferee (who holds the legal interest in the property) a trustee of the property for the benefit of the transferor or the payer to the extent of the aforesaid beneficial interest. In other words, this presumption divorces the equitable (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, beneficial) interest in the property from the legal interest …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The presumption of resulting trust may be rebutted either by evidence that B intended to make a gift of the property to T or by the counter-presumption of advancement. Given that clear evidence of B’s donative intent would have made it unnecessary to consider the presumption in the first place, analysing whether the presumption has been rebutted requires the court to make findings of fact in the usual way on equivocal or unsatisfactory evidence. As for the presumption of advancement, that applies where the parties are in certain recognised categories of relationships, such as a spousal relationship or the relationship between a child and a parent or someone in <span class="font-italic">loco parentis </span>to the child (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [60]–[82]). There is obviously no scope for the presumption of advancement in any of its varieties in the present case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 If the court finds that the presumption of resulting trust is rebutted, the effect is that there is, once again, simply no scope for equity to intervene by separating the beneficial interest in the property from legal title to it (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [56]–[57]). T’s ownership of the property at law is unconstrained by equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In this case, of course, there was no transfer of property to the second defendant. The Subscriber Shares were called into existence as property by operation of law under ss 19(3) to s 19(6) of the Companies Act. The Additional Shares were called into existence as property by operation of law under s 63 of the Companies Act. In both cases, the second defendant became the owner of the Shares not by way of transfer but from the very commencement of the Shares’ life as property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For the purposes of the resulting trust analysis, however, the creation of property must stand in the same position as the transfer of property. The moment to apply the resulting trust analysis is moment on 23 July 2015 at which the Subscriber Shares were called into existence as property. As Professor Tan Yock Lin has said, proprietary rights in the shares of a corporation vest upon its incorporation; specifically, “when the corporation is brought into existence by incorporation under law and co-instantaneously by the issue of capital stock according to a system of registration established by the corporation as issuer” (Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">Personal Property Law</span> (Academy Publishing, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Personal Property Law</span>”) at para 19.018). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As any claim to a beneficial interest in the Subscriber Shares is logically and legally anterior to a claim to a beneficial interest in the Additional Shares, I shall begin by applying the resulting trust analysis to the Subscriber Shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I begin with the presumption of resulting trust rather than by looking for clear evidence of donative intent. I do that for three reasons. First, this is not the usual dispute between B and T. T in the present case is the second defendant. It is accepted by everyone, including the second defendant herself, that nobody ever had any donative intent in favour of her. Second, it is not clear whether I should look for clear evidence of the plaintiff’s donative intent in favour of the first defendant or the first defendant’s donative intent in favour of the plaintiff. Choosing to examine donative intent from one party’s perspective amounts to accepting that party’s case without analysis. Finally, for the reasons I have already given, the plaintiff and the first defendant never had a single common intention. Their intentions diverged and varied over time (see [43]–[51] above). That is simply because they never reached an agreement in any sense of the word (see [50] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 It appears to me, therefore, that this is a case which leaves me no alternative but to begin by ascertaining whether the evidential presumption of a resulting trust arises and then considering whether it has been rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fanmail</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In ascertaining whether the presumption of resulting trust arose and has been rebutted, the first defendant relies heavily on the English case of <span class="font-italic">FanmailUK.com Ltd and others v Cooper and others </span>[2008] All ER (D) 183 (“<span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span>”). In my view, the reliance is justified. <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span> is very strong authority in favour of the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span>, the shareholders of a company called FanmailUK.com Ltd (“FanmailUK”) incorporated a second company (C2) to pursue a business idea created and developed using FanmailUK’s financial and human resources (at [214]). But C2 was not incorporated, as one would expect in these circumstances, as a wholly owned subsidiary of FanmailUK. Instead, all of C2’s shares (with one immaterial exception) were issued upon incorporation directly to FanmailUK’s shareholders. FanmailUK therefore did not own C2. FanmailUK then became insolvent (at [191]). It brought proceedings against C2’s shareholders (who were also FanmailUK’s shareholders) claiming that they held their shares in C2 on a presumed resulting trust for FanmailUK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Sales J (as he then was) held that: (a) a rebuttable presumption arose upon the incorporation of C2 that its shareholders held the shares in C2 on resulting trust for FanmailUK (at [206]); and (b) that presumption was unrebutted on the facts. He accordingly held that C2’s shareholders held their shares in C2 on trust for FanmailUK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is instructive to follow Sales J’s reasoning step by step. He first considered who provided the direct consideration for the shares in C2 to see whether the presumption of resulting trust arose. He then looked at the wider context to see whether that shed any light on whether the presumption of resulting trust arose. Finally, he examined the objective intention of the parties to see whether the presumption of a resulting trust was rebutted. I now describe each step of Sales J’s reasoning. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Direct consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 At the first step, Sales J held that it was C2’s shareholders, and not FanmailUK, who had borne the direct consideration for the shares. He noted that it was undisputed that C2 had allotted and issued its shares upon incorporation as unpaid shares. Indeed, even at the time of the litigation and even the judgment, neither the shareholders (at [198]) nor FanmailUK (at [201]) had ever paid to C2 the capital of £1 payable on each share. However, by subscribing for the unpaid shares, C2’s shareholders undertook a personal obligation to meet C2’s call for the unpaid capital by paying £1 on each share to C2 (at [202]). This personal obligation was the direct consideration for the shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Sales J then noted that this finding appeared to take FanmailUK’s case outside the scope of Lord Simond’s <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Shephard v Cartwright</span> [1955] AC 431 at 445. The import of that <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> is that, for the purposes of ascertaining whether the presumption of resulting trust arises in favour of B, shares allotted by a company to T where it is B who pays the capital due to the company on the shares are to be treated in exactly the same way as shares purchased by T from a third party where it is B who pays the purchase price of the shares to the third party (at [200]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span>, Lord Simonds’ <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> seemed to suggest that no presumption of resulting trust arose because it was not FanmailUK who provided the direct consideration to C2 for the shares allotted and issued to its shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Wider context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 At the second step, Sales J held (at [203]) that the fact that FanmailUK did not provide the direct consideration for the shares in C2 was not dispositive of whether the presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of FanmailUK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Sales J held (at [203]) that the “whole tenor of the transaction was that it was assumed that [FanmailUK] was giving the instructions for [C2] to be set up and would bear all the costs of doing that”. Thus, it was FanmailUK who instructed an accounting firm to incorporate C2. Further, it was FanmailUK who thereby assumed liability to pay the accounting firm’s fee for incorporating C2. And it was FanmailUK who duly paid the fee (at [197]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Sales J accordingly held that the consideration given by the shareholders for their shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, their personal obligation to meet C2’s call for unpaid capital of £1 on each share) was <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> and could not be regarded as governing the beneficial ownership of the shares<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [205]). As Sales J put it, the consideration provided by the shareholders was “tiny in comparison with the real economic cost of setting up” C2, which was the fee which the accounting firm had invoiced to FanmailUK and which FanmailUK had duly paid (at [203]). Therefore, examining the true economic substance of the entire transaction as part of the wider context, the act or event which had causative force in vesting the shares in C2’s shareholders was FanmailUK’s payment of the fee for C2’s incorporation. It was that payment which caused the shares in C2 to be called into existence as property and to vest in C2’s shareholders, and not their <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> agreement to assume a personal obligation to meet C2’s call for unpaid capital of £1 on each share. FanmailUK’s payment of this fee was the true consideration for the shares and gave rise to a presumption of resulting trust in favour of FanmailUK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Sales J then explained why it was legitimate to look at the true economic substance of the entire transaction as part of the wider context to determine whether the presumption of a resulting trust arose in favour of B (at [205]–[206]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">205. Is it legitimate, then, for the purposes of working out where the beneficial ownership of the … shares in [C2] lies and whether a resulting trust arose, to assess the position in the light of this wider context? In my judgment, it is. <span class="font-italic">Whether a resulting trust arises or not is based on the court's assessment of the true, or most likely, objective intention to be ascribed to the </span><span class="font-italic">parties to a transaction involving the acquisition of property as to the ownership of that property, based on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a factual presumption taken to arise from the identity of the person who pays for the property</span>. <span class="font-italic">The presumption is rebuttable, and its force and whether it is rebutted or not have to be assessed in the light of the </span><span class="font-italic">particular circumstances of the specific case</span>. <span class="font-italic">That being the nature of the presumption, it is appropriate in my view for the court to consider its application in the light of indications from the evidence about </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">how the parties regarded the true economic substance</span><span class="font-italic"> of the relevant transaction.</span> [At the date of C2’s incorporation] all parties regarded [C2] as a company set up by [FanmailUK] and at its cost. For all practical purposes, [FanmailUK] was regarded as the person who had paid for [C2] to be established.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">206. Therefore, I conclude that a rebuttable presumption arose upon the formation of [C2] that the shares in it were to be held beneficially upon a resulting trust for [FanmailUK].

Indeed, the evidence available to him reinforced rather than rebutted the presumption. Thus, he found that the parties’ objective intention was that the shares in C2 should be held in such a way as to allow C2 to be treated as part of the FanmailUK association of companies (at [220]). That was in part because the business idea that C2 had been incorporated to develop and exploit had itself been created and developed using FanmailUK’s financial and human resources (at [214]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 <span class="font-italic">Fanmail </span>was affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">FanmailUK.com Ltd v Cooper and others </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 1368. The Court of Appeal held at [79] that in deciding the beneficial ownership of the shares, Sales J had properly taken into account the wider context and circumstances surrounding the incorporation of C2 and, having done so, had been entitled to conclude that all of this pointed to C2’s shareholders holding their shares in C2 on resulting trust for FanmailUK.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fanmail is followed in a later English case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Smith and others v Hinchliffe and others </span>[2010] EWHC 396 (Ch), HHJ Hazel Marshall QC followed <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span> in considering what objective intention could be found regarding the ownership of shares in a company when applying the resulting trust analysis (at [220]–[221]). She found that there was an agreement or understanding to the effect that beneficial ownership of the company should be entirely with the plaintiffs and that the defendant, although the holder of all of the shares in the company, should have no beneficial interest in those shares. She therefore held that the defendant had acted in breach of trust by exercising the voting rights on those shares without consulting the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The English High Court refused the defendant leave to appeal against this judgment. The English Court of Appeal refused a renewed application for leave to appeal (<span class="font-italic">Smith</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Hinchliffe and others </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 1561). In doing so, the court cited <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span> with apparent approval.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">True economic substance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span> is clear authority that, in analysing whether the presumption of resulting trust arose over certain property in favour of B, it is legitimate – and may even be necessary – to have regard to the true economic substance of the parties’ transaction seen in its wider context. The dispositive factor is who, in true economic substance, bore the consideration under the transaction which caused the property to vest in T. This approach allows the court to discount, if not to disregard, any contribution which is in economic substance <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> (<span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span> at [203]). If the property in question is shares in a company which are allotted and issued to T as subscriber shares rather than purchased by T from a third party, and if T’s contribution or obligation to contribute to the company’s capital arising from those shares is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> when the true economic substance of the parties’ transaction is seen in its wider context, the presumption of resulting trust will arise in favour of the person who undertakes a contractual obligation to pay the fees and disbursements associated with incorporating the company or who actually pays those fees and disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 An example of this focus on the true economic substance of the parties’ transaction seen in its wider context is the purchase money resulting trust which arises in favour of B when B does no more than undertake a contractual obligation to repay a loan to a bank for the purchase price of the property conveyed to T. In <span class="font-italic">Andrew Curley v Nicola Parkes </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 1515 (“<span class="font-italic">Curley</span>”), the English Court of Appeal held that, in the absence of a contrary intention, B is treated in these circumstances as having provided the purchase price of the property, thereby raising the presumption of resulting trust in B’s favour (at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The relevant principle is that <span class="font-italic">the resulting trust of a property purchased in the name of another, in the absence of contrary intention, arises once and for all at the date on which the property is acquired</span>. <span class="font-italic">Because of the liability assumed by the mortgagor</span> in a case where monies are borrowed by the mortgagor to be used on the purchase, <span class="font-italic">the mortgagor is treated as having provided the proportion of the purchase price attributable to the monies so borrowed</span>. Subsequent payments of the mortgage instalments are not part of the purchase price already paid to the vendor, but are sums paid for discharging the mortgagor's obligations under the mortgage …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal approved and applied <span class="font-italic">Curley</span> in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [119].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The result in <span class="font-italic">Curley</span> is consistent with principle. Although it is the bank who actually provides the purchase price under the transaction which has causative force in vesting the property in T, there is no objective intention that the bank should acquire any proprietary interest in the property in consideration for doing so other than a pure security interest. Indeed, it could be said that the objective intention is a positive intention that bank should <span class="font-italic">not</span> acquire any proprietary interest in the property by reason of providing the purchase price other than a pure security interest. The consideration for the bank providing the purchase price is B’s contractual obligation to pay to the bank by instalments over time an amount equivalent to the purchase price plus interest, as stipulated in the terms of their contract of loan. In those circumstances, the true economic substance of the transaction is that it is B’s agreement to undertake that contractual obligation to the bank which has causative force in vesting the property in T.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Similarly, there may be circumstances in which it may be legitimate to have regard to other transaction costs in a conveyance of property in the resulting trust analysis, so long as they are of economic substance and not <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Currie v Hamilton</span> [1984] 1 NSWLR 687, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that the parties’ contributions to the cost of acquiring property was not merely their contribution to the purchase price, but also included transaction costs such as “incidental costs, fees and disbursements”. The Supreme Court of New South Wales recently reiterated this in <span class="font-italic">Cong v Shen (No 3)</span> [2021] NSWC 947. In that case, Ward CJ noted that “[i]n identifying the purchase moneys, a ‘broader concept’ is to be applied than simply the stipulated consideration for the purchase”. Therefore, “[r]egard may be had to the incidental costs of the purchase, such as legal expenses, stamp duty and registration” (at [1704]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Appellate Division of the High Court considered and approved these authorities in <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Tay Nguang Kee Serene </span>[2022] SGHC(A) 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span>, the court held that the resulting trust analysis should include transaction costs such as stamp duty which are <span class="font-italic">necessary ancillary </span>costs to cause the property to vest in T (at [68]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It seems to us to be at least arguable that…monetary contributions towards stamp duty should be included by the court in determining the parties’ respective beneficial shares under a resulting trust.

On this formulation of the doctrine of purchase money resulting trusts, <span class="font-weight-bold">the analysis is not limited to the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">purchase price of the property, but is instead broad enough to encompass stamp duty payable on the purchase of the property in question</span>.

</div> The narrative in the invoice shows that ILC charged the first defendant S$7,150.00 out of this total sum as professional fees for legal and other services which ILC had rendered to the first defendant in connection with the third defendant’s incorporation up to the date of the invoice. The narrative describes these services under three heads: (a) S$1,500 for incorporating the third defendant; (b) S$5,000 for services rendered by the second defendant in serving as both a nominee director and a nominee shareholder of the third defendant; (c) S$600 for drafting the 2015 Trust Deed. The invoice also covers the disbursements which ILC incurred in rendering these services. These disbursements amounted to S$384.50 for charges payable to the Accounting and Regulatory Authority of Singapore (“ACRA”) on the occasion of incorporating the third defendant and S$50 for miscellaneous incidentals. The remainder of the invoice is for goods and services tax at the prescribed rate of 7%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The first defendant did in fact pay these fees and disbursements to ILC.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 On these findings, the first defendant paid the direct consideration for the Subscriber Shares. He also undertook and discharged the contractual obligation to ILC which had causative force in vesting the shares in the second defendant when the true economic substance of the parties’ transaction is seen in its wider context. All of this was in place before the third defendant’s incorporation called the Subscriber Shares into existence as property. Accordingly, the presumption of resulting trust operated in the first defendant’s favour at the moment the Subscriber Shares came into existence as property. The presumption operated in the <span class="font-italic">scintilla </span><span class="font-italic">temporis</span> after the moment the Shares were called into existence as property and before the moment at which any express trust created by the 2015 Trust Deed could attach to the Subscriber Shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first defendant’s intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The next issue is whether there is any evidence available of a donative intention on the first defendant’s part when the Subscriber Shares were called into existence to rebut the resulting trust presumed in his favour. In my view, there is no such evidence. In particular, there is no evidence that the first defendant ever intended to make a gift of his beneficial interest in one of the Subscriber Shares in favour of the plaintiff.  Rather, the entire tenor of the negotiations and communications is that the first defendant’s never had a donative intent in favour of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I have previously noted that the protracted negotiations from May 2015 to December 2016 failed to yield any agreement in any sense of the word as to how the plaintiff was to be compensated for his past and future contributions to the Project. That failure extended to any agreement as to whether, and if so to what extent, the plaintiff was to have a proprietary interest in the Project, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> by being a beneficial owner of shares in the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 At this point, it is useful to look in more detail at the parties’ communications by email on 22 July 2015 and 23 July 2015. To preserve the true sequence of these email communications, I have adopted the first defendant’s synchronisation of the time stamps on these emails to Singapore time. Synchronisation is necessary because the plaintiff was then in Sri Lanka; the first defendant, Mr Baldock and Mr Weldon were then in London; Mr Jordan was then in Melbourne; and Ms Chong was then in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first defendant was to be sole beneficial owner of the third defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 On 22 July 2015 and all the way up to 2.52 pm on 23 July 2015, the first defendant’s intent was that the plaintiff was to have no proprietary interest in the Project. That is clear from six emails which the parties exchanged during that period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 First, at 8.08 am on 22 July 2015, Mr Jordan sent the plaintiff and Mr Gluck a checklist of items relating to the Project, asking the plaintiff to review the checklist.

</div> One of the items on the checklist was a call option which the plaintiff was to execute in Mr Gluck’s favour upon the incorporation of the third defendant. At that time, the third defendant was to be a wholly owned subsidiary of MG Holdings. The call option obliged the first defendant, once the option was exercised, to give up the shares which he was to hold in MG Holdings (and therefore his interest in the third defendant) for purely nominal consideration.

</div> Mr Jordan was concerned that not having Mr Gluck and the plaintiff appear as owners of the third defendant would be a major departure from the terms of the Project as approved by the GOSL. He asked the plaintiff to comment on this concern. The plaintiff raised no protest at having no proprietary interest in the third defendant. Instead, he simply told Mr Jordan that he would reply on this point later that evening.

</div> Regarding his response at [101] above, the plaintiff gave a similar explanation. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, the plaintiff claimed that he did not read Mr Jordan’s email in detail and intended to send only a holding response. His evidence is that he was not aware of the substance of Mr Jordan’s comment until shortly before commencing this action.

</div> But the plaintiff gave a different explanation for his failure to protest to this email in cross-examination. His evidence at first was that he did not protest to Mr Jordan because all his discussions about his shareholding in the third defendant and his compensation for his contributions to the Project were only with Mr Gluck and not with Mr Jordan or the first defendant.

It is the plaintiff’s evidence that during his phone call with Mr Gluck, Mr Gluck agreed that the shareholding of the third defendant would be split equally between the defendant, Mr Gluck and the plaintiff.

Their evidence is consistent with all of the emails up to 2.52 pm on 23 July 2015 which I have summarised at [96]–[102] above. Those emails show that the first defendant had no donative intent with regard to any of the Subscriber Shares, whether in favour of the plaintiff or in favour of Mr Gluck.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The 2015 Trust Deed and the instructions to ILC preceding it therefore stand alone in the evidence before me as indications of the first defendant’s donative intent and go against the weight of the evidence. The weight of the evidence is that there was no such intention, even after the “change of plan” at 3.34 pm on 23 July 2015. In my view, the only change in the first defendant’s intention which this email and the terms of the 2015 Trust Deed establish is an intent to reflect the plaintiff as a beneficial owner of one of the Subscriber Shares as a stop gap measure to reassure the GOSL without any intent to make a gift of that beneficial interest to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 For all of these reasons, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities the first defendant had no donative intent with respect to any of the Subscriber Shares. I therefore find that the presumption of resulting trust in his favour over the Subscriber Shares stands unrebutted. Accordingly, I hold that the second defendant held all of the Subscriber Shares on a presumed resulting trust for the first defendant from the time they were called into existence as property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The effect of the 2015 Trust Deed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I have found that the 2015 Trust Deed and the “change of plan” leading up to its execution is not evidence of an objective intention which would rebut the presumption of resulting trust arising from the circumstances in which the third defendant was incorporated. But the 2015 Trust Deed is also an express statement in writing that the second defendant intended to hold one of the Subscriber Shares on trust for the plaintiff at the time she executed the deed. The second issue which I must consider (see [41(b)] above), therefore, is whether the second defendant holds one of the Subscriber Shares on an express trust for the plaintiff under the terms of the 2015 Trust Deed. On this issue, I accept that she does not, albeit for a slightly different reason than that put forward by the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 On this issue, the first defendant submits that at the time the second defendant executed the 2015 Trust Deed, she did not hold the beneficial interest in the Subscriber Shares because that interest had already resulted to the first defendant at the moment of the third defendant’s incorporation under a presumed resulting trust. I have already made a finding to this effect. The first defendant then submits that <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">pso facto</span> the 2015 Trust Deed could not have constituted the second defendant an express trustee of the beneficial interest in one of the Subscriber Shares for the plaintiff.

</div> Although the first defendant does not put it this way, this amounts to a submission that <span class="font-italic">n</span><span class="font-italic">emo dat quod non habet</span>: no one can give what she does not have. The second defendant did not have the beneficial interest in one of the Subscriber Shares and therefore could not have given it to the plaintiff under an express trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I do not accept that the fact that the beneficial interest in trust property is not vested in the trustee means <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> that a trustee cannot convey the beneficial interest in the trust property to a third party. A trustee is by definition the legal owner of trust property. A trustee is capable at common law of conveying legal title to trust property to a third party. Whether any such conveyance is consistent with the trust or is a breach of trust is a separate matter. The important point is that the conveyance is capable of being valid to vest title to the trust property in the third party, even if it is a breach of trust. The personal consequences of a conveyance in breach of trust will be determined in accordance with the terms of the trust (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(3) (Butterworths Asia, 2018) at para 110.426). The proprietary consequences of a conveyance in breach of trust will be determined by the rules of equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 One of the rules of equity is that a conveyance of trust property in breach of trust to a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser of a legal interest in the trust property for value without notice that it is trust property, and therefore without notice of the subsisting beneficial interests in it, is as effective to vest title to the property in the purchaser as it would be if the trustee could vest beneficial title in the purchaser (<span class="font-italic">Independent Trustee Services Ltd v GP Noble Trustees Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others (Morris intervening); Morris v Morris (Independent Trustee Services Ltd and another intervening) </span>[2013] Ch 91 at [106]). Once that conveyance takes place, the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser’s legal title to what was formerly trust property defeats any beneficial interest which may have subsisted in the property up to that point (<span class="font-italic">MKC Associates Co Ltd and another v Kabushiki Kaisha </span><span class="font-italic">Honjin and others (Neo Lay Jiang Pamela and another, third parties; Honjin Singapore Pte Ltd and others, fourth parties) </span>[2017] SGHC 317<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [292]). The beneficiary’s only recourse is against the trustee or the proceeds of sale, not against the former trust property or its bona fide purchaser. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Conceptually, therefore, it does not follow that a trustee cannot convey the beneficial interest in trust property to another person simply because the trustee does not own the beneficial interest in the property. If that were the position, equity would be unable to protect equity’s darling. The first defendant’s argument is therefore not so much incorrect as it is incomplete. If the plaintiff were a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser of a legal interest in the Shares for value without notice of the first defendant’s subsisting equitable interest under the presumed resulting trust, it is possible for the second defendant to vest absolute title to one of the Subscriber Shares in him. But the plaintiff is not equity’s darling. He did not acquire a legal interest in the Shares. He was not a purchaser. He gave no value for the benefits conferred by the 2015 Trust Deed. It is for this reason that the plaintiff cannot claim any interest in the Subscriber Shares which defeats the first defendant’s interest in them under the presumed resulting trust. The 2015 Trust Deed conferred no proprietary rights whatsoever on the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Although the express intention which the second defendant manifested by executing the 2015 Trust Deed was clear on its face (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> to declare an express trust over one of the Subscriber Shares in favour of the plaintiff), her intention did not have any legal effect. To my mind, even on the plaintiff’s best case, the 2015 Trust Deed is nothing more than an imperfect gift by the first defendant to the plaintiff. Equity will not assist the plaintiff, being a volunteer, to perfect the imperfect gift (<span class="font-italic">Personal Property Law</span> at paras 10.074–10.075).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Additional Shares</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second defendant holds all the Additional Shares on a presumed resulting trust for the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The third issue which I must consider (see [41(c)] above) is whether the second defendant holds one-third of the Additional Shares on an express trust for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s claim fails with his claim on the Subscriber Shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The plaintiff’s case for a beneficial interest in one-third of the Additional Shares stands or falls with his claim for a beneficial interest in one of the Subscriber Shares. I have found that the plaintiff has no beneficial interest in any of the Subscriber Shares. His claim for a beneficial interest in one-third of the Additional Shares necessarily also fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Even assuming in the plaintiff’s favour, and contrary to my holding, that he had a beneficial interest in one of the Subscriber Shares, I would have rejected his claim for a beneficial interest in one-third of the Additional Share for the reasons advanced by the first defendant (see [34] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first defendant paid the direct consideration for the Additional Shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Additional Shares comprised 9,997 shares of US$0.01 each in the third defendant. The obligation to contribute to the third defendant’s capital for these 9,997 shares was therefore an obligation to pay the third defendant US$99.97.  It is undisputed: (a) that the first defendant paid Mr Baldock US$100 as direct consideration for the Additional Shares on the occasion of their allotment and issue; and (b) that Mr Baldock received US$99.97 out of that US$100 from the first defendant and held it for an on behalf of the third defendant as the capital payable on the Additional Shares.

</div> This sum of $99.97 (like the US$3 payable to the third defendant for the Subscriber Shares) is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> in absolute terms. However, the true economic substance of the transaction leading to the allotment and issuance of the Additional Shares seen in its wider context shows that this sum is not <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> in relative terms. There is no evidence of any fees, disbursements or other transaction costs associated with the allotment or issuance of the Additional Shares as in the case of the Subscriber Shares. Looking at the true economic substance of the entire transaction as part of the wider context, the first defendant’s payment of the capital payable on the Additional Shares was, on the evidence before me, 100% of the consideration which had causative force in calling the Additional Shares into existence. Therefore, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Fanmail</span>, the presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of the first defendant when the Additional Shares came into existence in the same manner and for the same reasons as it did in relation to the Subscriber Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Further, by this time, nothing had changed in terms of the first defendant’s donative intent.

</div> I do not accept the submission. The purpose of rights of pre-emption, such as those conferred by Article 47, is to give a shareholder the right to maintain her proportionate shareholding in a company despite the allotment and issue of additional shares in the company. The second defendant is and has always been the sole shareholder of the third defendant. Neither the plaintiff nor the first defendant have ever been shareholders in the third defendant. There are therefore no other shareholders in the third defendant for the second defendant use rights of pre-emption to maintain her proportionate shareholding against. No pre-emption rights arose at any time in respect of the Additional Shares. The third defendant simply allotted and issued the Additional Shares to the second defendant under Article 48 of its articles of association. There was never any basis for the offer mechanism in Article 47 to be invoked or applied. <span class="font-italic">Chiang Sing </span><span class="font-italic">Jeong </span>is of no assistance to the plaintiff in establishing a claim to a beneficial interest in the Additional Shares, even if he is assumed to have a beneficial interest in one of the Subscriber Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Since I have found that the second defendant holds the Subscriber Shares and Additional Shares on trust for the first defendant and not for the plaintiff, there is no need for me to deal with the plaintiff’s arguments on s 7(2) of the CLA and the 2016 Trust Deed. There is also no need for me to deal with the first defendant’s argument that the trust under the 2015 Trust Deed was validly terminated when Mr Gluck exercised his authority under Clause 2.2 of the 2015 Trust Deed to terminate the trust (which was granted to him by the Letter of Indemnity) by instructing the second defendant (through Mr Baldock) to execute the 2016 Trust Deed in November 2017.

There is therefore no need for me to make a finding on his alternative defence of estoppel. But for completeness, I should record that I reject the first defendant’s estoppel defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The first defendant raised the defence of promissory or proprietary estoppel, estoppel by representation and estoppel by convention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 To establish a promissory or proprietary estoppel, the first defendant has to prove that the plaintiff made an objectively clear and unequivocal representation that caused the first defendant to take a certain course of action in circumstances that render it unconscionable for the plaintiff to resile from his promise (<span class="font-italic">Day, Ashley Francis</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yeo Chin Huat Anthony and others </span>[2020] 5 SLR 514 (“<span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis</span>”) at [188]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 To establish an estoppel by representation, the first defendant has to prove: (a) that the plaintiff made a clear and unambiguous representation of fact to the first defendant; and (b) the first defendant relied on the representation to his detriment (<span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis </span>at [196]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 To establish an estoppel by convention, the first defendant has to prove: (a) that there was a course of dealing between the first defendant and the plaintiff in a contractual relationship; (b) that the course of dealing was such that both parties proceeded on the basis of an agreed interpretation of their contract; and (c) that it is unjust or unconscionable to allow either party to go back on the agreed interpretation (<span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis</span> at [197])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I am prepared to assume in the plaintiff’s favour that the doctrine of proprietary estoppel in Singapore law is not confined to land and can be asserted over shares (<span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis</span> at [190]–[191]). I also bear in mind that being too ready to give greater scope to the doctrine of proprietary estoppel in commercial contexts carries with it a real risk of undermining commercial certainty and the law of contract (<span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis </span>at [192]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In <span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis</span>, Aedit Abdullah J found that no estoppel of any variety had been established because the “various correspondences and statements made were not finalised, but were proposals and negotiations working towards a future agreement”. Moreover, “[t]he matters between the parties also remained fluctuating with the proposed shareholding changing constantly” (at [205]). That is precisely my finding in relation to the parties’ negotiations up to and including 23 July 2015. I have already observed that there was no agreement in any sense of the word as to how the plaintiff was to be compensated for his past and future contributions to the Project. This was so even after the third defendant was incorporated in July 2015 and even when the Additional Shares were issued in December 2016. Accordingly, there was no contract, let alone an agreed interpretation or understanding which could form any basis for an estoppel by convention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I also find that the plaintiff did not make any clear and unambiguous representations of fact that to the first defendant that the first defendant<span class="font-italic"> </span>would be the sole beneficial owner of the third defendant. While the plaintiff acquiesced in the proposal to grant Mr Gluck a call option over the plaintiff’s shareholding in the Project for nominal consideration, acquiescence<span class="font-italic"> </span>is not the same as a clear and unambiguous representation of fact. For estoppel by acquiescence to be established, it must be shown that the party estopped stood by while knowing full well that an innocent party was mistaken as to his rights (<span class="font-italic">Keppel </span><span class="font-italic">Tatlee Bank Ltd v Teck Koon Investment Pte Ltd and others </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 355 at [27]). Estoppel by acquiescence was neither pleaded nor put in issue by the first defendant. Therefore, there was no basis for the first defendant’s arguments in support of promissory or proprietary estoppel, or even estoppel by representation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In any case, even if the plaintiff had made any such clear and unambiguous representation, there was no evidence that the first defendant had relied on the representation or had therefore suffered any form of detriment which would warrant equity’s intervention in his favour. There is no evidence that the first defendant relied on the plaintiff’s representations to invest time or money in the Project. What drew the first defendant to the Project was the fact that the Project was related to the fast-moving consumer goods businesses he was already involved in.
