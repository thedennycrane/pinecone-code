        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by the
                    Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore, the respondent (the
                    “Respondent”) in Civil Appeal No 81 of 2012/Q, to strike out the
                    notice of appeal filed by the appellant (“the Appellant”), OpenNet
                    Pte Ltd, on the ground that the Appellant had not obtained leave to appeal to
                    the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s 34(2)(d), read with the Fifth Schedule, of
                    the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the
                    SCJA”). At the conclusion of the hearing we ruled that the Appellant did
                    not require leave of court to file the appeal and accordingly dismissed the
                    application to strike out the notice of appeal. We now give our
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant is a joint venture company
                    incorporated in Singapore. The Respondent is a statutory board established
                    pursuant to the Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore Act (Cap
                    137A, 2000 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By way of Originating Summons No 1099 of 2011/V,
                    the Appellant filed an application under O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    Rev Ed 2006) (“ROC”) for leave from the High Court to commence
                    judicial review of a decision made by the Respondent that both a business trust
                    by the name of NetLink Trust and its trustee-manager CityNet Infrastructure
                    Management Pte Ltd had fulfilled the requirements set out in a deed of
                    undertaking furnished by Singapore Telecommunications Limited to the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant’s application for leave to
                    commence judicial review was heard on 17 January 2012, 21 February 2012, 2 March
                    2012 and 19 April 2012. On 7 June 2012, the Appellant’s leave application
                    was dismissed. On 6 July 2012, the Appellant filed a notice of appeal against
                    the High Court’s refusal to grant leave to commence judicial
                    review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 23 July 2012, the Respondent filed the
                    present application for an order that the Appellant’s notice of appeal be
                    struck out on the ground that the Appellant had not obtained leave to appeal as
                    required under s 34(2)(d), read with the Fifth Schedule, of the
                SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The sole issue which we had to decide was
                    whether the Appellant was required to apply for leave to appeal from the High
                    Court in order to file the notice of appeal against the Judge’s refusal to
                    grant leave to commence judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legislative framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before examining the arguments made by the
                    parties, it may be helpful to lay out the legislative framework for appeals on
                    civil matters. As held by this court in <em>Blenwel Agencies Pte
                        Ltd v Tan Lee King</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 529 (<em>“Blenwel”</em>), “[t]he Court of Appeal is a
                    creature of statute and, hence, is only seised of the jurisdiction that has been
                    conferred upon it by the relevant provisions in the legislation creating
                    it”. Therefore, as a starting point, we refer to s 29A of the SCJA, which
                    provides that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over appeals from “any
                    judgment or order of the High Court in any civil cause or matter”,
                    subject to the provisions of the SCJA or “any other written law
                    regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be
                    brought”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        of its original or of its appellate jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to
                        the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and
                        conditions upon which such appeals may be brought. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 34(1) of the SCJA sets out the matters
                    which are non-appealable, while s 34(2) sets out the matters which are
                    appealable only with leave:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Respondent made three arguments as to why
                    the Appellant was required to apply for leave to appeal from the High Court in
                    order to file an appeal against the Judge’s refusal to grant leave to
                    commence judicial review. We shall examine each of these three arguments,
                    starting with the second argument. We shall also examine one of the
                    Appellant’s arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s second argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Respondent’s second argument was
                    that leave to appeal was required because the Appellant’s application for
                    leave to commence judicial review was an “interlocutory
                    application” within the meaning of paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of
                    the SCJA. Paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA is a catch-all
                    provision which prescribes a blanket requirement of leave to appeal against
                    orders made in all “interlocutory application[s]” which are not
                    specifically exempted from the requirement for leave. The Respondent argued that
                    the Appellant’s application for leave to commence judicial review was an
                    “interlocutory application” because, being an application for
                    leave, it was simply a preliminary step to the substantive application for
                    judicial review. Moreover, an application for leave to commence judicial review
                    is “interlocutory” because the application must be made by an
                        <em>ex parte</em> originating summons, <em>ie</em>, where a respondent may not even be heard on the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Furthermore, the Respondent argued that the
                    Appellant itself had proceeded on the basis that its application for leave to
                    commence judicial review was an interlocutory proceeding because all of its
                    affidavits in support of the application for leave stated that they contained
                    statements of information or belief. Order 41 r 5 of the ROC provides that
                    “[a]n affidavit sworn for the purpose of being used in interlocutory
                    proceedings may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and
                    grounds thereof”. Therefore, the Appellant’s reliance on hearsay
                    evidence is consistent with the Respondent’s contention that the
                    Appellant’s application was an “interlocutory
                    application”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     We could not accept the Respondent’s
                    second argument for these reasons. First, even if the Appellant had thought that
                    the application for leave to commence judicial review was an interlocutory
                    proceeding, and hence its affidavits contain hearsay evidence permitted under O
                    41 r 5, such a belief or understanding on the part of the Appellant carries
                    little weight and can hardly be determinative. If the Appellant’s
                    understanding was wrong, it remained wrong. It cannot be thereby rendered right.
                    There is no question of estoppel arising. We accept that the Appellant’s
                    subjective belief as to whether “interlocutory application” in
                    paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA includes an application for
                    leave to commence judicial review is only germane in so far as it is a view
                    which this court should consider in ascertaining the correct meaning of the
                    expression “interlocutory application” in the context of the
                    SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Second, the Respondent’s contention that
                    an application for leave to commence judicial review is
                    “interlocutory” because the application is simply a preliminary
                    step to the substantive application for judicial review, and must be made by
                        <em>ex parte</em> originating summons, does not really
                    assist the Respondent. The expression “interlocutory application”
                    is not defined in the SCJA. According to Jowitt’s Dictionary of English
                    Law, “[a] proceeding or application is interlocutory when it is
                    peripheral to the main hearing determining the outcome of the case, whether
                    before or after judgment” (see <em>Jowitt's Dictionary of
                        English law</em> (Daniel Greenberg gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010)
                    at p 1215). Another dictionary defines “interlocutory
                    applications” to mean “in the meantime; is a request made to the
                    court, or to a Judge for its interference in a matter arising in the progress of
                    a cause or proceeding” (Anandan Krishnan, <em>Words,
                        Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 2008) at para I0990). These definitions do not resolve the issue.
                    On these definitions, it is doubtful if the plain and ordinary meaning of
                    “interlocutory application” could encompass a pre-action
                    application such as the present application for leave to commence judicial
                    review, where there is no “main hearing determining the outcome of the
                    case” to begin with. More importantly, a purposive reading of the SCJA as
                    elaborated below reveals that “interlocutory application” in the
                    context of paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA does not include an
                    application under O 53 r 1 for leave to commence judicial review. For the
                    purpose of the discussion below, we shall use the general expression of
                    “interlocutory application” to mean any application that is made
                    before the substantive trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Third, this court should give the expression
                    “interlocutory application” in paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule
                    of the SCJA an interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying the
                    SCJA. Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation
                        that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether
                        that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall
                        be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or
                        object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     According to s 9A(2) (read with s 9A(3)(c)) of
                    the Interpretation Act, consideration may be given to a piece of material which
                    is “capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the
                    provision”, including “the speech made in Parliament by a Minister
                    on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill
                    containing the provision be read a second time in Parliament”. At the
                    Second Reading of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill 2010
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (18 October 2010) vol 87 cols 1367­­–1395), which
                    eventually brought into being s 34(2)(d) and the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA
                    through the enactment of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act (No 30
                    of 2010) (“Act 30 of 2010”), the Senior Minister of State for Law,
                    Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee (“the Minister”), stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The streamlining of appeals to the Court of Appeal arising from
                        interlocutory applications is found in clause 9 of the
                        Bill.  Between the time when a party files a <em>civil case</em> in court and when the case is heard, lawyers may
                        file what are known as “<em>interlocutory
                            applications”</em> in court<em>.  These
                            applications deal with procedural matters that prepare the case for the
                            hearing;</em> for example, requesting the court to order the other
                        party to furnish information or documents that are relevant to the
                        hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added] </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This part of the Minister’s statement
                    underscored the fact that normally, “interlocutory applications”
                    relate to procedural matters with the view to preparing the case for trial.
                    However, it does not follow that an “interlocutory application” in
                    the context of the SCJA will always be for that purpose, <em>viz</em>, preparing the case for trial. This is because an
                    application for summary judgment, or for the striking out of an action, is no
                    less an “interlocutory application”, as can be seen from paragraph
                    (e) of the Fifth Schedule, even though such applications do not “prepare
                    the case for the hearing”. Later in the same speech, the Minister further
                    explained thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 9 therefore amends section 34 to streamline and restrict appeals to
                        the Court of Appeal on interlocutory matters. <em>Interlocutory applications will now be categorised based on their
                            importance to the substantive outcome of the case.</em> With this
                        calibrated approach, some interlocutory orders will not be allowed to go to
                        the Court of Appeal, whilst others can only go to the Court of Appeal with
                        the permission of the High Court. The decision of the High Court whether to
                        grant permission is final. <em>The right to appeal all the
                            way to the Court of Appeal will, however, remain for interlocutory
                            applications that could affect the final outcome of the case.</em>
                        The types of orders in the three categories are set out in the Fourth and
                        Fifth Schedules to the Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now, as Ms Lim herself points out, there are certain interlocutory
                        applications which may potentially affect the substantive outcome of the
                        trial. But this is precisely why the present amendments categorise
                        interlocutory applications into three groups which are carefully
                        differentiated based on their importance to the substantive outcome of the
                        case. Those that are non-appealable and they are really based on the
                        existing section 34 – slightly expanded but still there is a precedent
                        for that – and <em>those which will be appealable as of
                            right and, like I said, these are the interlocutory applications that
                            will substantially affect the outcome of the case. </em><em>So that remains, appeals to the Court of Appeal from the High
                            Court as a matter of right</em>, and the middle category, which is
                        the norm, is appealable to the Court of Appeal, but with the leave of the
                        High Court. I think we have to see this matrix in context and we are dealing
                        with interlocutory applications which usually do not involve novel points of
                        law or important points of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me illustrate with an example, in the case where a party applies to
                        strike out his opponent's claim and fails. If he is dissatisfied with the
                        Registrar's decision, he can appeal to High Court Judge who hears the
                        application afresh as if it came before him for the first time. So, a lot of
                        pain is taken by the High Court Judge to hear this appeal as though it was
                        de novo, or hearing for the first time. But if the High Court Judge refuses
                        to strike out the claim, this decision will no longer be appealable as of
                        right to the Court of Appeal. This is because the effect of such a decision
                        is that the claim will proceed to trial as it ordinarily would. The
                        substantive rights of the parties are not affected because the case will go
                        on to trial. On the other hand, <em>if the judge agrees to
                            strike out the claim, then the applicant can file a further appeal to
                            the Court of Appeal as of right. This is because the decision means that
                            the case can no longer proceed to trial and it would clearly put an end
                            to the party's substantive rights.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now, it should be pointed out that the default position is that all
                        interlocutory applications are appealable to the Court of Appeal with leave.
                        It is those interlocutory applications which clearly do not affect the
                        conduct of the trial that have been placed in the no-right-to-appeal
                        category which is contained in the Fourth Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The rationale behind the calibrated approach
                    mentioned by the Minister is really to ensure that in general, a decision of a
                    High Court judge in an interlocutory application is not unnecessarily taken all
                    the way to the Court of Appeal, leading to a waste of judicial time. In short,
                    the purpose underlying the SCJA regarding the right to appeal is that an appeal
                    to the Court of Appeal will generally be as of right for orders made at
                    interlocutory applications which have the effect of finally disposing of the
                    substantive rights of the parties; while an appeal to the Court of Appeal will
                    ordinarily be denied for orders made at interlocutory applications which do not
                    finally dispose of the substantive rights of the parties, and which are deemed
                    to involve established principles of law. The middle category which consists of
                    orders made at interlocutory applications which lie in the middle of these two
                    extreme situations may be appealed to the Court of Appeal only with leave of
                    court. (see Teo Guan Siew, “Recent Amendments to the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act and the Subordinate Courts Act”, Singapore Law Gazette
                    (January 2011)) at 16-21).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This scheme of things is clearly reflected in
                    the SCJA. One example is seen in the case of an application for summary
                    judgment. Paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA is a catch-all
                    provision imposing a blanket requirement for leave to appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal for any “interlocutory application”, and paragraph (e)(i)
                    specifically lists an order made at the hearing of an application for summary
                    judgment to be exempted from this blanket requirement for leave. Where an
                    application for summary judgment is refused and leave to defend the proceedings
                    has been given, s 34(1)(a) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Fourth Schedule of
                    the SCJA provide that no appeal to the Court of Appeal shall be allowed. The net
                    result of these provisions is that where summary judgment has been ordered,
                    which has the effect of finally disposing the substantive rights of the parties,
                    leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is not required. On the other hand, where
                    leave to defend is granted in an application for summary judgment, and as such
                    the order does not finally dispose of the substantive rights of the parties, no
                    appeal may be made against that order. The effect of such an order is that the
                    rights of neither party are affected as the matter will just go for trial, where
                    both parties will have ample opportunity to canvas their respective positions.
                    No appeal is allowed because it would serve no useful purpose in prolonging such
                    interim litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Another example would be an application to
                    amend a pleading. Paragraph (g) of the Fourth Schedule provides that no appeal
                    shall be brought to the Court of Appeal where a Judge makes an order giving
                    leave to amend a pleading in general, since the order does not finally dispose
                    of the substantive rights of the parties. On the other hand, where a Judge makes
                    an order refusing leave to amend a pleading, the consequence of that order would
                    be that material facts and causes of action or defences that are sought to be
                    raised would not be adjudicated upon, and this <em>may</em>
                    have serious consequences on the substantive rights of the party which sought to
                    make that amendment. Because of that, paragraph (a) of the Fifth Schedule only
                    allows an appeal against such refusal to the Court of Appeal provided that leave
                    of court is obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As the Minister explained, the amendments
                    brought about by Act 30 of 2010 introduced a new category-approach regime based
                    on the type of interlocutory application and the eventual order made thereon.
                    The question as to which of the three categories an order made in an
                    interlocutory application would fall within is critical. As for the present
                    application which the Appellant had initiated by way of an originating summons
                    (“OS”), the very relief sought in the OS was to obtain leave to
                    commence proceedings for judicial review. This was all that was sought in the
                    OS, which had been refused. In refusing leave to commence judicial review, the
                    substantive issue in the OS had been decided upon by the Judge. There was
                    nothing more to proceed on. The substantive rights of the parties had come to an
                    absolute end unless there could be an appeal. Therefore, the application made by
                    the Appellant in the OS did not come within the meaning of “interlocutory
                    application” under paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA. As
                    the Minister had explained in Parliament, the Fourth and Fifth Schedules of SCJA
                    were concerned with interlocutory applications. Accordingly, no leave of court
                    was needed by the Appellant in order to file an appeal against the decision of
                    the Judge in refusing to grant leave to enable the Appellant to commence
                    judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s first argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Respondent’s first argument was that
                    leave to appeal was required pursuant to O 53 r 8 of the ROC (“O 53 r
                    8”) which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Appeal to Court of Appeal (O. 53,
                            r. 8)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An appeal shall lie from an order made by a Judge in Chambers under this
                        Order as it does in the case of an interlocutory order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     According to the Respondent, O 53 r 8 requires
                    that an appeal against a Judge’s order in an application for leave to
                    commence judicial review has to be made in the same manner as an appeal against
                    an interlocutory order of a Judge made in other proceedings. The manner in which
                    an appeal against an interlocutory order is to be made is specified by s
                    34(2)(d), read with paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule, of the SCJA, which
                    provide a blanket requirement of leave for all “order[s] at the hearing
                    of any interlocutory application” which are not specifically exempted
                    from the requirement for leave. Therefore, the Appellant here was required to
                    apply for leave from the High Court to appeal against the Judge’s refusal
                    to grant leave to commence judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Furthermore, the Respondent argued that if
                    “interlocutory application” under paragraph (e) of the Fifth
                    Schedule of the SCJA does not include an application for leave to commence
                    judicial review by way of an OS, O 53 r 8 would be rendered nugatory and otiose.
                    The fact that O 53 r 8 was retained and renumbered after the amendments to s 34
                    of the SCJA were enacted shows that the requirement for leave to appeal was
                    applicable to the orders made under O 53. If this were not the case, there would
                    have been no reason to retain O 53 r 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We will begin our analysis by first comparing
                    the present O 53 r 8, which came into being in 2002, with its predecessor
                    provision, <em>ie</em>, the previous O 53 r 7 of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the previous O 53 r 7”).
                    The previous O 53 r 7 provided that if leave to commence judicial review had
                    been refused by the High Court Judge, the dissatisfied applicant could make a
                    second application for leave to the Court of Appeal, instead of filing an appeal
                    against the refusal of the judge:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Appeal to Court of Appeal (O.
                            53, r. 7)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Where leave to apply for an order of mandamus,
                            prohibition or certiorari has been refused by a Judge, an application
                            for such leave may be made to the Court of Appeal under Order 57, Rule
                            16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Before the present O 53 r 8 was introduced in
                    2002, the then s 34(1)(c) of the SCJA provided that no appeal shall be brought
                    to the Court of Appeal “where a Judge makes an interlocutory order in
                    chambers unless the Judge has certified, on application within 7 days after the
                    making of the order by any party for further argument in court, that he requires
                    no further argument”. The effect of the previous O 53 r 7, read with the
                    then s 34(1)(c) of the SCJA, was that a party who was dissatisfied with the
                    judge’s refusal to grant leave to commence judicial review did not have to
                    fulfil the requirement under the then s 34(1)(c) by writing in to the judge to
                    request for further arguments so as to be able to appeal against that order.
                    Instead, the dissatisfied applicant could make a second application for leave to
                    the Court of Appeal, without filing an appeal against the judge’s refusal
                    to grant leave to commence judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The previous O 53 r 7 was amended in 2002 to
                    what we see is now O53 r 8. How was O 53 r 8 (which was numbered as O 53 r 7 in
                    2002) to be read with the then s 34(1)(c)? It seems clear to us that it meant
                    that the recourse available to a dissatisfied party in an application for leave
                    to commence judicial review was that of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, and
                    the dissatisfied applicant could no longer make a second application to the
                    Court of Appeal for leave to commence judicial review. Further, by providing
                    that the appeal shall be made as in the case of an “interlocutory
                    order”, the effect of O 35 r 8 was that the requirement for further
                    arguments in the then s 34(1)(c) of the SCJA applied. In other words, the
                    dissatisfied party must first, within seven days, write to the judge to hear
                    further arguments; and only if the judge should refuse to hear further arguments
                    that he could appeal to the Court of Appeal. If the judge should agree to hear
                    further arguments, and if on such further hearing he should decide to stick by
                    his earlier decision, the dissatisfied applicant would be entitled to appeal as
                    of right to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Now, the amendment to the SCJA in 2011
                    (brought about by Act 30 of 2010) has repealed s 34(1)(c). It is pertinent to
                    note that during the second reading of the Bill which led to the enactment of
                    Act 30 of 2010, the Minister stated that the requirement for further arguments
                    in the then s 34(1)(c) of the SCJA was merely a “technical
                    requirement” which was removed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Next, clause 7 adds a new section 28(B) to make changes to an aspect of
                        the litigation process commonly referred to by lawyers as "Further
                        Arguments". Currently, a litigant must first apply to the High Court to make
                        "Further Arguments" before he can file an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
                        Failure to do so within the stipulated time frame could prevent the litigant
                        from subsequently filing an appeal to the Court of Appeal. This amendment
                        removes this technical requirement by making the need to file such "Further
                        Arguments" voluntary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With the repeal of the then s 34(1)(c) in the
                    light of the above statement of the Minister, the question which now arises for
                    consideration is how should O 53 r 8 be construed? As explained earlier at [27],
                    the reference to “interlocutory order” in O 53 r 8 was to link it
                    with the then s 34(1)(c) of the SCJA so that the dissatisfied party in an
                    application for leave to commence judicial review must first, within seven days,
                    write to the judge to hear further arguments before an appeal may be filed. Now
                    that s 34(1)(c) has been repealed, there is no longer a reference to an
                    “interlocutory order” in the SCJA. Therefore, it seems that the
                    reference to “interlocutory order” in O 53 r 8 is no longer
                    meaningful, but a relic of the past. Perhaps the Rules Committee may wish to
                    have another look at O 53 r 8 to see how it could be better synchronised with
                    the scheme under the present s 34, and Fourth and Fifth Schedules of SCJA. If we
                    bear in mind the rationale for the three category appeal approach, then for the
                    reasons which we have alluded to earlier at [18] to [21], the Appellant here
                    should be entitled to lodge an appeal as of right. The refusal by the Judge to
                    grant leave to the Appellant to commence judicial review had brought the
                    proceedings to an abrupt and absolute end. A historical informed view of O 53 r
                    8, including the reference to “interlocutory order” therein, does
                    not undermine the strong parliamentary intention that an appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal will remain as of right for orders made at interlocutory applications
                    which will finally dispose of the substantive rights of the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s third argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Respondent’s third argument is that
                    there are compelling reasons why leave is required in order to appeal against a
                    refusal by a judge to grant leave to commence judicial review. An application
                    for leave to commence judicial review is refused because the applicant has
                    failed to pass the low threshold of showing an “arguable or prima facie
                    case of reasonable suspicion”, or that there are serious flaws with the
                    application. If the applicant could not even satisfy such a low threshold, then
                    such an application should not be allowed to invoke the Court of Appeal’s
                    jurisdiction as of right. Otherwise, that would defeat the key purpose of the
                    application for leave to commence judicial review, which is to prevent a
                    wasteful use of judicial time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     While we see the drift of this argument, the
                    fact remains that the decision of the Judge to refuse leave would bring to an
                    end the Appellant’s attempt to challenge the decision of the Respondent.
                    Unless it is shown that the right of a party to appeal against a decision of the
                    High Court is statutorily curtailed, that party would be entitled to appeal to
                    the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As we have stated at [21] above, the
                    Appellant’s application for leave to commence judicial review under O 53
                    is not an “interlocutory application” under paragraph (e) of the
                    Fifth Schedule of the SCJA, and the Appellant did not have to seek leave to
                    appeal from the High Court Judge before appealing to the Court of Appeal. The
                    policy reason cited by the Respondent is only relevant in so far as it could
                    assist in arriving at a purposive interpretation of the relevant provisions. In
                    view of the clear purpose underlying the relevant provisions in the SCJA, this
                    policy reason advanced by the respondent carries little weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the Appellant’s argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There remains just one of the
                    Appellant’s arguments which we would like to touch on briefly, even though
                    it would not affect the decision which we had made in this case. The argument is
                    that no leave of court is required to appeal against the Judge’s order
                    refusing leave to commence judicial proceedings because the order in question
                    falls within the exception in paragraph (e)(iv) of the Fifth Schedule of the
                    SCJA. According to the Appellant, paragraph (e)(iv) stipulates that leave is not
                    required where the order made was to dismiss an action or a matter commenced by
                    writ of summons or by any other originating process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Paragraph e)(iv) of the Fifth Schedule of the
                    SCJA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except with the leave of a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court
                        of Appeal in any of the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    where a Judge makes
                            an order at the hearing of any interlocutory application other than an
                            application for any of the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   to dismiss an action or a matter commenced by
                                a writ of summons or by any other originating process;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the face of it, we can see the sense of the
                    argument here – that since the Judge dismissed the appellant’s
                    application for leave to commence judicial review, and the application for leave
                    to commence judicial review was initiated by an originating summons, the present
                    case should fall within the exception in paragraph (e)(iv), and no leave of
                    court is required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     However, we agree with the Respondent’s
                    contention that this argument is flawed. Paragraph (e)(iv) only applies where a
                    judge makes an order pursuant to an <em>application to dismiss an
                        action or a matter</em> commenced by writ of summons or by any other
                    originating process. There are two essential prerequisites. First, there must be
                    an application by the opposing party. Second, that application must be to ask
                    the court to dismiss the action or matter claimed in the writ of summons or any
                    other originating process. The present case satisfied none of these two
                    prerequisites. Accordingly, we could not accept the argument that paragraph
                    (e)(iv) applied here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For the above reasons, we dismissed Summons No
                    3702 of 2012/Y, and ordered that costs be in the appeal.</p>
