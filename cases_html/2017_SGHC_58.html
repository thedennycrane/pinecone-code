</div> The events on which the defendant relied for its defence which occurred after the agreement was concluded also did not give rise to an irresistible inference of fraud.

</div> Given that the plaintiff has not pleaded any applicable foreign law, the defendant is on this ground also entitled to unconditional leave to defend. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, the defendant submits that the cheque is not a bill of exchange under s 3 of the Act because its delivery was conditional within the meaning of s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. This is because the defendant delivered the cheque to the plaintiff on condition that it be returned to the defendant upon completion of the transaction envisaged under the agreement.

These principles are well-known and undisputed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 A plaintiff seeking summary judgment must first show that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case: <span class="font-italic">Thomson Rubbers </span>([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [9]. If he fails, his application ought to be dismissed with the usual adverse costs order. If he crosses that threshold, then the defendant comes under a tactical burden under O 14 r 3 to raise “an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried”, commonly known as a triable issue. To meet this burden, the defendant must show grounds which raise a reasonable probability that it has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence in relation to the issues in dispute which ought to be tried: <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 32 at [25]. Alternatively, the defendant may attempt to show that there ought to be a trial for some other reason. If the defendant fails to establish either of these grounds, the court will enter judgment against the defendant: <span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management &amp; Consultancy Services Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1342 at [43] – [47]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues for determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The following are the key issues which arise for my determination:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the plaintiff has failed to plead the governing law applicable to its claim on the cheque;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the plaintiff has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the defendant has raised any triable issues;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) whether the defendant should be granted conditional or unconditional leave to defend; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) if the defendant is to be granted conditional leave, what is the appropriate sum which the defendant ought to furnish as security in order to be let in to defend the claim.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I deal with these issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Governing law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It is trite that a Singapore court will apply Singapore law unless a litigant establishes that foreign law applies, in which case the asserter must plead and prove the foreign law as an issue of fact: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2016: Volume 1 </span>(Foo Chee Hock, ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) at para 18/11/3; <span class="font-italic">Star Cruise Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 183 (“<span class="font-italic">Star Cruise</span>”) at [77]. This rule is premised on the fundamental assumption that the rights of the parties are to be given effect only because they exist in a legal system which gives these rights their meaning and content. Thus G P Selvam J in <span class="font-italic">Star Cruise</span> (at [77]) said that “contracts are incapable of existing in a legal vacuum”, borrowing the words of Lord Diplock in <span class="font-italic">Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation v Kuwait Insurance Co </span>[1984] AC 50 at 65. The natural consequence of the stated assumption is that Singapore law applies until and unless it is displaced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, the defendant’s contention that the plaintiff has failed to plead foreign law gets the principle upside down. The defendant asserts that foreign law applies but maintains that the plaintiff bears the burden of pleading the applicable foreign law as fact, failing which its claim fails <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">limine</span>. This amounts to saying that the plaintiff’s claim exists in a legal vacuum unless and until the plaintiff can satisfy the court otherwise. But this directly contradicts the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Star Cruise</span>. As Selvam J made clear at [77], it is for “the asserter” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the party who asserts that foreign law applies – to establish that foreign law applies, to plead the applicable foreign law and to then prove that law as fact, since the court cannot be expected to take judicial notice of the foreign law (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> ss 39(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 39(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), 40 and 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Evidence Act). In <span class="font-italic">Star Cruise</span>, both parties filed affidavits of foreign law. Selvam J thus considered the plaintiffs’ failure to plead the applicable foreign law to be egregious. Indeed, he would have proceeded to adjudicate the claim on the basis of Singapore law had the parties not already expended time and effort to arrange for expert witnesses on foreign law to give evidence. If the defendant in the present case is correct, then Selvam J should have simply dismissed the action before him. But the law will not allow a party who alleges that the parties’ legal relationship is governed by a system of law other than the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> to cast the burden of disproving that allegation on his opponent. The defendant’s objection in the present case is therefore without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 All this, of course, is quite apart from the fact that the choice of law clause in the agreement applies to the agreement and not to the cheque. This curious clause appears to give the “aggrieved party” an option to choose the governing law from three systems of private law, none of which actually have any existence as an identifiable system of private law:

One is compelled simply to take it at face value. First, the clause gives an aggrieved party the right to choose the substantive law which should apply in arbitral proceedings. That is not the nature of the proceedings before me. Those proceedings are in a court of law in Singapore, whose jurisdiction is unchallenged. That court applies Singapore law to resolve disputes before it, unless and until foreign law is pleaded and proved. Second, the choice of law clause plainly concerns the agreement and not the cheque. The action before me is on the cheque and not the agreement. As the plaintiff rightly points out in its written submissions, the cheque constitutes a separate contract and creates obligations for the drawer and rights for the payee that are autonomous from any underlying transaction: see <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Heng v Amixco Asia Pte Ltd</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 654 at [13].

All that Belinda Ang Saw Ean J decided in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">iallo (HC)</span> was that the plaintiff’s claims on cheques drawn by the defendant should go to arbitration together with its claims under the distributorship agreement from which the cheques arose. That was the result because Belinda Ang J found that the cheques and the claims were so closely connected as to warrant that result. She did not decide that the plaintiff was not entitled to have its claim on the cheques arbitrated separately from the distributorship agreement, using a summary procedure if necessary. Second, the defendant in the present case did not seem to be aware that <span class="font-italic">Piallo</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>was specifically overruled on the close connection test by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International Pte Ltd v Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza SpA </span>[2016] 5 SLR 455 at [42]. That decision was handed down two weeks before I heard oral arguments in the present case.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The Court of Appeal held (at [42]) that an arbitration clause in a contract will generally not be treated as covering disputes arising under an accompanying bill of exchange in the absence of express language or express incorporation. The fact that a bill is closely connected to an agreement or to disputes arising under an agreement is irrelevant. And third, as I have explained at [47] above, the burden is not on the plaintiff but on the defendant to plead and prove foreign law if its case is that Singapore law does not apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Accordingly, the defendant’s objections as to the governing law are unsustainable. The plaintiff has no obligation to plead foreign law to succeed in its claim on the cheque. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">P</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">rima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The issue of whether the plaintiff has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case may be addressed through two questions. The first is whether the plaintiff is entitled to sue on the cheque without any reference to the underlying transaction comprised in the parties’ agreement. The second is whether the defendant is estopped from challenging the plaintiff’s right to sue on the cheque. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As a general matter, while I explore the relevant legal principles in some detail, I apply them to the facts only to ascertain whether the plaintiff has satisfied the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard on a summary judgment application.

These are ss 3(1) to (2), 13, 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 73 of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 3</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain in money to, or to the order of, a specified person, or to bearer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) An instrument which does not comply with these conditions, or which orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is not a bill of exchange.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 13</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Where a bill or an acceptance or any indorsement on a bill is dated, the date shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be the true date of the drawing, acceptance, or indorsement, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) A bill is not invalid by reason only that it is antedated or post-dated.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 21</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 73</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) A cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a banker payable on demand.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to this Part, the provisions of this Act applicable to a bill of exchange payable on demand apply to a cheque.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Nothing in this case turns on the distinction between a cheque and a bill of exchange, the former being merely a species of the latter (see <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International (HC)</span> ([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [147] which describes a similar relationship between a promissory note and a bill of exchange). Therefore, the caveat in s 73(2) of the Act does not apply. It is also common ground that if the cheque is not a bill of exchange under s 3 of the Act or not capable of being sued on by the plaintiff by virtue of any other provision under that statute, then the plaintiff has no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case and its application for summary judgment must fail. Accordingly, I focus solely on whether the fact that the cheque was post-dated and the fact that it was delivered as a form of collateral pursuant to an underlying contract could deprive the plaintiff of the right to sue on the cheque. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 According to s 13(2) of the Act, a bill is not invalid by reason only that it is antedated or post-dated. This provision is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 13(2) of the English Bills of Exchange Act 1882, on which <span class="font-italic">Byles</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) has the following to say, at para 21–006:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A bill of exchange is not invalid by reason of its being ante-dated or post-dated; and the date appearing on the cheque is deemed to be the true date of its drawing unless the contrary be proved.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Post-dated cheques have long been held to be regular instruments. A post-dated cheque does not become payable until the date shown upon it and a bank which pays it prematurely will not be entitled to debit the drawer’s account. If the drawer countermands payment before the date written upon the post-dated cheque, the drawee bank must not pay it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is therefore clear that the mere fact that the cheque is post-dated does not render it invalid. The defendant, however, relying on a number of cases, submits that a post-dated cheque is a bill of exchange only between the date of its issue and the date which it bears, and since the cheque was presented after the date which it bears, it was by then invalid.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 This submission is unfortunately based on the defendant’s misreading of the cases which it cites. Those cases in fact support the view set out in the passage from <span class="font-italic">Byles</span> cited at [58] above and indeed lend it a measure of historical credence. I will discuss the cases briefly to illustrate this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The first case is <span class="font-italic">Forster v </span><span class="font-italic">Mackreth </span>(1867) LR 2 Ex 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Forster</span>”). In that case, the defendant had no authority to draw bills of exchange on behalf of his firm but had the authority to draw cheques. The defendant drew a post-dated cheque and delivered it seven days before the date marked on it. He was then sued personally on cheque when it was dishonoured. The court held that because the post-dated cheque – not being payable on demand – was equivalent to a bill of exchange at seven days’ date, the defendant had no authority to draw it and was therefore not liable on it. Kelly CB said (at 167) that “as regards its practical effect, a post-dated cheque is the same thing as a bill of exchange at so many days date as intervene between the day of delivering the cheque and the date marked upon the cheque”.

</div>
</div> Kelly CB’s point was to equate a post-dated cheque with a bill of exchange until at least the date marked upon the cheque. His point was not, as the defendant in the present case contends, to invalidate a post-dated cheque after that date. Accordingly, the defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Forster</span> is misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The next case is <span class="font-italic">Hinchcliffe</span> ([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). A customer of a bank drew two cheques, one post-dated and the other current-dated. The bank honoured the post-dated cheque even though it was presented before the date marked on it and debited the customer’s account accordingly. That left insufficient funds in the customer’s account to meet the current-dated cheque. The current-dated cheque was therefore dishonoured upon presentation. The customer sued the bank for damages. The Supreme Court of Victoria allowed the plaintiff’s claim. The court approved the rule in <span class="font-italic">Forster</span> – that a post-dated cheque is in substance a bill of exchange – and held that the bank was negligent in paying the post-dated cheque before the date marked on it. The necessary premise of this decision is that the post-dated cheque was a valid instrument on and after the date marked on it. Accordingly, the defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Hinchcliffe</span> is also misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The third and final case is <span class="font-italic">Ashok </span><span class="font-italic">Yeshwant Badave v Surendra Madhavrao Nighojakar and Another</span> (2001) 3 SCC 726 (“<span class="font-italic">Ashok</span>”), a decision of the Indian Supreme Court. In this case, the drawer of a cheque appealed against an order finding that he had committed the offence under s 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 of failing to pay to a payee the value of a post-dated cheque after being notified by the payee that the cheque had been dishonoured. An element of this offence was that the payee must have presented the cheque within six months of the date on which the cheque was drawn. So the drawer argued that the six-month period ran from the date the cheque was issued, and that because the payee had presented the cheque more than six months after the date of issue, the offence was not made out. The Supreme Court of India disagreed, holding (at [18]) that the six-month period ran from the date marked on the cheque, and that the payee had presented the cheque within that period. <span class="font-italic">Hinchcliffe</span> was cited (at [9]) with approval. The offence was therefore made out and the appeal was dismissed. Like the previous two cases, <span class="font-italic">Ashok</span> is also premised on the validity of a post-dated cheque on and after the date marked on it. <span class="font-italic">Ashok</span> too does not assist the defendant’s case at all. In fact, it supports the plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendant then cites Poh Chu Chai, <span class="font-italic">Law of Negotiable Instruments </span>(LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chu Chai</span>”) at pp 282 to 284, which the defendant submits states that whether a post-dated cheque is valid on and after the date marked on it is an issue unresolved by the Singapore courts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Again, the defendant’s argument is misconceived. The unresolved issue which <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chu Chai</span> actually identifies is whether a post-dated cheque is “regular” within the meaning of s 29 of the Act, in order to enable title to the cheque to pass to a holder in due course. That is not the issue before me. There is therefore no need for me to express a view on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Section 13(2) of the Act states that a bill will not be invalid “only” by reason that it is post-dated. The word “only” in that provision contemplates the possibility of a post-dated cheque being invalid for other reasons. The scope of those other reasons is uncertain on the face of s 13(2) itself. The defendant claims that because the cheque was delivered as a form of collateral, it is invalid because it is conditional within the meaning of ss 3 and 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. I must therefore decide whether this could be a reason for holding a post-dated cheque invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff submits in response that a post-dated cheque delivered as a form of collateral or security is a valid cheque capable of being sued on independently from the underlying agreement. As authority for this proposition, the plaintiff relies on a number of cases, including <span class="font-italic">City Hardware Pte Ltd v Goh Boon </span><span class="font-italic">Chye </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 754 and <span class="font-italic">Thomson Rubbers</span> ([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). But these cases simply assume that proposition to be true without analysis or explanation. As the parties have made submissions to me on this issue, I shall proceed to discuss the principles on the application of ss 3, 13(2) and 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act that are relevant to the disposition of the matter before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, a bill of exchange may be “conditional” or “unconditional” in two distinct senses under each of ss 3 and 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. The distinction is between an unconditional order and an unconditional delivery of an order. Section 3 of the Act defines a bill of exchange as an unconditional order to pay. An order to pay which is conditional does not qualify as a bill of exchange: s 3(2) of the Act. But an unconditional order to pay can nevertheless be delivered conditionally. Section 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) recognises the right of the drawer to retain title to a bill by way of conditional delivery, the effect of which is to deprive the transferee of the right to be paid on the bill: <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Chern Lean </span>([39] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [42]. It would also deprive the transferee of standing to sue on the bill, because delivery must be complete in order for title to pass. This is implied in s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) by the reference in that provision to a delivery not for the purpose of transferring property. In short, a conditional order to pay does not fulfil an essential criterion to be a bill of exchange, whereas conditional delivery of an unconditional order operates merely to deprive the transferee of the right to sue on the bill. It follows that the tests for determining conditionality under s 3(1) and s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are different. I therefore turn to elaborate on each. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It is well-established that for an order to be unconditional within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act, it must be imperative and not merely precatory, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it cannot carry within its words the option of non-compliance. The imperative is necessary to place the drawee under an obligation to the drawer to pay the value of the bill to the payee. As <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chu Chai </span>([64] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) explains at p 28:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The requirement that a drawer’s instructions must constitute an unconditional order is no doubt imposed with the object of ensuring that the drawee is placed under a contractual obligation to carry out the drawer’s instructions. The order given must be imperative. If the drawer’s instructions are no more than a mere request to the drawee to carry out the drawer’s instructions, the instructions will not constitute an order as the drawee has the option of not complying with the request. In <span class="font-italic">Little v </span><span class="font-italic">Slackford </span>(1828) 1 Mood. &amp; M. 171, the Court decided that a bill of exchange addressed to a drawee as follows: “Mr. Little, please to let the bearer have seven pounds, and place it to my account and you will oblige”, constituted a mere request to the drawee. The instrument was not a bill of exchange because the instructions did not constitute an order to the drawee. The drawee who made payment on the bill was not barred from claiming reimbursement from the drawer even though the bill was not stamped as a bill of exchange. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Separately, for delivery of a bill to be conditional under s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, the transferor must intend to suspend delivery – in the legal as opposed to the factual sense – until a certain condition is satisfied, or to make delivery for some purpose other than to transfer title to the cheque to the transferee: <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Chern Lean</span> ([39] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Chern Lean</span>, the Court of Appeal held that the cheques had been delivered unconditionally because the transferor had intended to attach a condition merely to the use of the proceeds and not to the delivery of the cheques. In fact, the transferor could not have intended to retain title to the cheques, because if he had intended to do so, then the proceeds of the cheques would not have been available to the transferee and it would have been pointless to impose the condition.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Therefore the fundamental question under s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is in my view whether a transferor intends without qualification to confer title to the cheque upon the transferee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 A transferor must also communicate this intention clearly to the transferee: <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Chern Lean </span>at [43]; <span class="font-italic">Byles</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at para 9–005. This is an objective test to be satisfied by the party who claims that such an intention exists. Whether a communication is sufficiently clear will depend on the circumstances of the case. But as a general rule, strong evidence will need to be shown to demonstrate that the transferor of a bill of exchange did not intend for title to the bill to pass to the transferee with delivery. These strict requirements are necessary to preserve commercial efficacy, in service of which the principle of cash equivalence exists. To develop this rationale fully, it is necessary to rehearse the commercial advantages of a bill of exchange over a mere promise to pay, which I explained in <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International (HC)</span> ([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [152]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cash equivalence principle gives a bill of exchange two important commercial advantages over a mere promise to pay. First, where the drawer’s payment obligation under the bill has not yet fallen due, a bill offers the payee the means to monetise the promise. The payee can, quickly and effectively, convert by negotiation the drawer’s promise to pay in the future into cash in the present. Second, once the drawer’s payment obligation under the bill has fallen due and until that obligation is met, the bill is <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>security for the payee. The payee can, quickly and effectively, convert by legal action the drawer’s promise to pay in the present into cash in the present. Simply put: the drawer is obliged to pay now and argue later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The logical prerequisite for the realisation of these advantages is that the transferee must know with certainty whether and when he may present or negotiate the bill. To the extent that he is uncertain about the status of his bill as a cash equivalent, the very purpose of a bill of exchange is frustrated. In this regard, it is the proper function of the law to minimise the scope and possibility of such uncertainty in the interests of commercial efficacy. It must follow, therefore, that for a court to hold a transferee unable to sue or be paid on a bill by reason of its conditional delivery, strong and clear evidence must be presented of the transferor’s intention to make only conditional delivery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The circumstances which can render physical delivery conditional are varied. In <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Chern Lean</span>, the Court of Appeal (at [42]) cited with approval a passage from a previous edition of <span class="font-italic">Chalmers</span> that discusses these circumstances. An updated version of that passage can now be found at p 124 of the current edition of <span class="font-italic">Chalmers </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The relevant part, upon which the defendant in the present case places great reliance in its submissions,

Upon fulfilment of the condition, a conditional delivery becomes complete and takes effect at that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 A brief discussion of the relevant authorities at this juncture is useful. For the first proposition in the text quoted above, <span class="font-italic">Chalmer</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> cites the case of <span class="font-italic">Alsager</span><span class="font-italic"> v Close </span>(1842) 10 M &amp; W 576 (“<span class="font-italic">Alsager</span>”). That was an action in trover brought by the assignees of a bankrupt against the transferee of a bill of exchange drawn in the amount of £1,600. The bankrupt had delivered the bill, before his bankruptcy, to the transferee as an indemnity for a bond which the bankrupt had executed jointly with a third party. The transferee had promised to return the bill in the event that the bond was cancelled. The bankrupt’s assignees now showed the transferee the cancelled bond and demanded the return of the bill. The transferee refused to deliver up the bill, and later even obtained £800 on the bill. Lord Abinger CB, with whom Gurney B and Rolfe B agreed, allowed the assignees’ claim. They held that the assignees had title to sue on the bill, standing as they did in the shoes of the bankrupt, and that the transferee had converted the bill to his own use by receiving the money on it (at 583):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The bill was deposited with the defendant for a special purpose, and his duty was to hold it until that purpose was determined. I do not think that a man who holds a bill for a particular purpose of this nature has a right, without authority, to go and receive money on the bill. I think, therefore, the receipt of £800 was an actual conversion; so that, quâcunque viâ, the bankrupt might have maintained the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For the proposition that delivery is complete upon fulfilment of the condition, <span class="font-italic">Chalmer</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> cites the case of <span class="font-italic">Clifford Chance v Silver </span>[1992] 2 Bank LR 11 (“<span class="font-italic">Clifford Chance</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chu Chai </span>([64] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at pp 140 to 141 also relies on this authority for the proposition that once the condition is met, the drawer’s liability to pay crystallises. In <span class="font-italic">Clifford Chance</span>, a cheque was indorsed by the solicitors of a purchaser of land to solicitors of the vendor towards payment of a deposit, but on the condition that the cheque was to be “returnable on demand until we authorise you to effect an exchange”. The English Court of Appeal held that the initial delivery of the cheque was conditional under s 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Bills of Exchange Act 1882, which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. But the court also held that delivery became unconditional when the contracts for the sale of the property were exchanged and the conditions stipulated were fulfilled. Sir Christopher Slade put it thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, on the facts of this case and in view of section 21(2) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, delivery to Clifford Chance of the cheque for £100,000 did not take place until 10th January 1991, when the deposit of £100,000 payable under the first agreement became due and Clifford Chance ceased to hold the cheque to the order of Frederick Hass &amp; Stone. By virtue of section 31(3) of the 1882 Act a bill payable to order is “negotiated” (only) by the indorsement of the holder completed by delivery. In my judgment therefore the cheque was negotiated on 10th January 1991. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Another case which should be mentioned is <span class="font-italic">Marina Sports</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Alliance Richfield Pte Ltd </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 385 (“<span class="font-italic">Marina Sports</span>”). The defendant relies on this case to argue that the delivery of the cheque was conditional under s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Marina Sports</span>, the broker of the sale of a vessel issued the seller a post-dated cheque with specific instructions not to present the cheque until after the broker had received payment from the buyer. The seller presented the cheque before that happened and the cheque was dishonoured. The broker subsequently countermanded the cheque because of the seller’s alleged bad faith. The High Court upheld the District Court’s refusal to grant summary judgment on the cheque, opining simply that there were triable issues and that the broker should be given conditional leave to defend. While the court’s reasoning was elliptical, it clearly took into account the broker’s argument that “since the cheque had been issued conditionally and the condition had not been fulfilled, there was no valid delivery under s 21” (at [9]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It can be seen from these cases that it is possible to effect conditional delivery of a bill where that bill is intended as a form of collateral for an obligation to pay arising from an underlying contract, whether that contract is a bond (<span class="font-italic">Alsager</span>), a contract for the sale of land (<span class="font-italic">Clifford Chance</span>) or a contract for the brokerage of a sale of a chattel (<span class="font-italic">Marina Sport</span>). But these cases also demonstrate that the intention to effect conditional delivery must be objectively established. In each of these cases, it was objectively clear that the transferee had taken physical delivery of the bill subject to an express condition which the transferor had clearly attached to the delivery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I add that the mere fact that a bill is post-dated does not clearly and objectively establish that the transferee intended to attach a condition to delivery which was to endure beyond the date marked on the bill. Post-dating a bill suggests only that the transferor intends the transferee to present the bill unconditionally on or after the date it bears, and that the burden lies on anyone who asserts the contrary to establish the contrary. Indeed, this must be implicit in any bill of exchange if the principle of cash equivalence is to have any meaning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 A contrasting example would be the cheque in <span class="font-italic">Marina Sport</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>. That cheque was delivered with specific instructions to the transferee not to present it until further advice from the transferor even on or after the post-dated due date: <span class="font-italic">Marina Sport</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> at [5]. While the High Court did not comment on whether this would be sufficient to make delivery conditional within the meaning of s 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), I am inclined to think, for the purpose of illustrating the principle being discussed here, that it would have. But I express no view on how else conditional delivery might be effected in practice. All will depend on the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The scope of s 13(2) of the Act is now sufficiently clear for the purposes of the present case. While a bill is not invalid by reason “only” that it is post-dated, it is invalid if it embodies a conditional order to pay: s 3(2) of the Act. It would, however, not be invalid if it were delivered conditionally. Conditional delivery in the sense contemplated by s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act goes not to the validity of the bill, but to whether title to the bill passes to the transferee. Thus, while a conditionally-delivered bill may be a valid bill, the holder of that bill will not be able to sue on it until delivery is completed through the fulfilment of the condition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 To summarise, the following propositions are clear from the authorities:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For an order to be unconditional within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act, it must be imperative and not precatory. An instrument which contains a conditional order to pay is not a bill of exchange. The focus here is on a condition imposed on the <span class="font-italic">drawee</span> of the bill and not on the payee or transferee of the bill. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) For physical delivery of a bill to be conditional within the meaning of s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, the transferor must intend to hold delivery in suspense until a certain condition is satisfied or to make delivery for some purpose other than that of transferring title to the bill to the transferee. In either case, the transferor must communicate his intention clearly to the transferee. Conditional delivery deprives the transferee of title to the bill and consequently of the right to sue on it, so long as the condition remains unsatisfied.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The party who asserts that physical delivery of a bill was intended to be conditional delivery of the bill within the meaning of s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) bears the burden of proving that on an objective test. As a general rule, strong evidence will be necessary to establish that the transferor of a bill intended to attach a condition to delivery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 With these principles in mind, I turn to the facts of the case. As regards the possibility that the cheque is a conditional order and therefore invalid under s 3(2) of the Act, the defendant produced no evidence and raised no argument that in drawing the cheque in favour of the plaintiff, the defendant gave only tentative or conditional instructions to the drawee, DBS Bank, to pay the plaintiff the value of the cheque. The defendant’s suggestion that the cheque is not unconditional for the purposes of s 3(1) of the Act therefore has no basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On a proper view of the law, it is clear that the defendant’s real and only sustainable argument is that it effected physical delivery of the cheque to the plaintiff subject to a condition within the meaning of s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. Insofar as the defendant attempts to characterise the condition as a “contingency” that invalidated the cheque, it mistakenly relies on cases in which bills were invalidated because they contained a conditional order to the drawee to pay within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act.

</div>
</div> Given that the defendant’s order to DBS Bank was not conditional, it is not necessary to discuss those cases. I therefore turn to consider the defendant’s argument under s 21(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Without expressing a final view on the merits, and taking the defendant’s case at its highest, I accept that the initial delivery of the cheque may have been conditional. This is because cl 2 of the parties’ agreement, which I have reproduced at [10], expressly required the plaintiff to return the cheque to the defendant after the defendant had procured the SBLC. This contractual requirement to return the cheque is arguably analogous to the promise made by the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Alsager</span> ([73] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to return the bill upon the cancellation of the bond for which the bill had been transferred to him as an indemnity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Further, cl 2 of the parties’ agreement arguably evidences a clear communication by the defendant of its intention to withhold title to the bill at initial delivery. But just as it was implicit that the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Alsager</span> would obtain title to the bill upon a default on the bond, so too in the present case, it is implicit that the plaintiff would obtain title to the cheque if the defendant failed to perform its obligations under the parties’ agreement. It is not in dispute that that is what in fact happened. Therefore, the plaintiff has at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that it has title to sue on the cheque.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In this regard, I also take the view that the plaintiff has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the time within which the defendant must perform its obligations under the parties’ agreement had lapsed, such that the plaintiff had title to the cheque when it presented the cheque for payment. What this time is may be discerned from cll 2 and 3 of the parties’ agreement, which are reproduced at [10] above. The effect of cl 2 of the parties’ agreement was to stipulate that the cheque was to bear the date 15 August 2014. The effect of cl 3 was to oblige the defendant to procure the SBLC within 15 international banking days after the plaintiff had transferred to the defendant 4% of the value of the SBLC. The plaintiff made the transfer on 20 June 2014. It is common ground that the defendant did not procure the SBLC as contractually stipulated or at all. When 15 banking days had elapsed from 20 June 2014, any condition arising from cl 3 of the parties’ agreement ceased to operate. By 15 August 2014, the defendant’s delivery of the cheque to the plaintiff – even if conditional at the outset – had become completely unconditional. When the plaintiff presented the cheque on 21 November 2014 and re-presented it on 24 November 2014, therefore, it had title to the cheque and was fully entitled to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In response, the defendant submits that there is no evidence of any discussion between the parties as to what would happen to the cheque should the defendant default on its obligation under cl 3 of the agreement, and therefore the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish that it was entitled to sue on the cheque.

</div>
</div>
</div> But the law dictates that the very opposite is true. As I explained at [77] above, it is implicit in the nature of a bill of exchange that the defendant <span class="font-italic">qua</span> transferor intended that the plaintiff should be entitled to present the cheque. If it was the defendant’s intention that the plaintiff should not be entitled to present the cheque even if the defendant defaulted on its obligation under cl 3 of the parties’ agreement and even after 15 August 2014, the burden was on the defendant to make this further condition objectively clear to the plaintiff at the time it physically delivered the cheque to the plaintiff and the burden is on the defendant to establish that further condition in these proceedings. It did not do so then and cannot do so now. The court, confronted now simply with the cheque as it stands, must accept and give effect to the plaintiff’s right to sue on it. By pointing to the fact that there is no evidence of the parties’ intentions as to the consequences of the cheque in the event of a default, when it has the burden of producing that evidence, the defendant has ironically undermined its own submission that delivery was conditional and remained conditional after 15 August 2014. This results from a classic application of the cash equivalence principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For these reasons, I consider that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for its claim on the cheque. The defendant’s submissions that the cheque is invalid and that its delivery remains conditional are without merit. These submissions raise no triable issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The plaintiff, relying on <span class="font-italic">Hatton </span>(see [32] above), also briefly put forward the argument that the defendant, having secured the benefit of the €400,000 which the plaintiff transferred to it, is in any case now estopped from claiming that the cheque is invalid.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Written Submissions dated 2 August 2016, paragraph 38.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> <span class="font-italic">Hatton</span> is a case about payment in international trade. A seller drew bills of exchange on a buyer pursuant to a contract for the sale of goods. The seller’s bank discounted the bills and presented them to the buyer, who accepted them. In exchange, the bank released to the buyer the bills of lading covering the goods. The buyer then failed to pay the bank and the bank sued on the bills of exchange, seeking summary judgment for the sum owed. The buyer argued that the bills were invalid under s 3(2) of the Act as they were contingent orders to pay. The High Court rejected this argument, holding (at [12]) that the buyer, having secured the advantage of obtaining the goods by accepting the bills, could not now claim that the bills it accepted were not valid bills. The court thus dismissed the buyer’s appeal and upheld the assistant registrar’s order granting summary judgment to the bank. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Hatton</span> may be distinguished in several respects and is not of immediate assistance to the plaintiff. First, unlike the buyer in <span class="font-italic">Hatton</span>, the defendant here is not really challenging the validity of the cheque. The cheque clearly contains an unconditional order to pay. As I observed at [82] above, what the defendant is really saying is that the cheque was delivered conditionally. Second, whereas the buyer in <span class="font-italic">Hatton</span> was the drawee of the bill, the defendant in the present case is the drawer of the cheque and DBS Bank is the drawee. This relates to the third difference, which is that <span class="font-italic">Hatton</span> did not involve a cheque but a bill of exchange, and the principles on acceptance with respect to each type of bill are different. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant in the present case submits whether a <span class="font-italic">Hatton</span>-type estoppel could arise notwithstanding these differences. Since I have already decided that the plaintiff has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, I prefer to express no view on whether the defendant is estopped in any way from challenging the plaintiff’s right to sue on the cheque.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Triable issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is well-established that an application for summary judgment on a dishonoured cheque will succeed unless the defendant raises an arguable case of fraud, illegality or a total or quantified partial failure of consideration: <span class="font-italic">Marina </span><span class="font-italic">Sports</span> ([75] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [8] – [10];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rals International (HC)</span> ([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [151].

</div>
</div> It is not disputed that the effect of the addendum was to extend retrospectively, from two to seven international banking days after the conclusion of the agreement, the period within which the plaintiff was to transfer to the defendant 4% of the value of the SBLC. The plaintiff transferred the 4% to the defendant on 20 June 2014, which was seven days after the conclusion of the agreement on 13 June 2014. For that reason, according to the plaintiff, it was necessary to “regularise” this transaction by way of the addendum.

The basic principle is that a bill of exchange, like any other contract, is not enforceable unless it is supported by consideration: <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chu Chai </span>([64] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 230; <span class="font-italic">Byles</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at para 19–001. But while a party who seeks to enforce a contract generally bears the burden of establishing that it is supported by consideration, the position is reversed in the context of bills of exchange, where under s 30(1) of the Act the existence of consideration is presumed until the contrary is proved by the party resisting the action on the bill: <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chu Chai </span>at 230; <span class="font-italic">Byles</span> at para 19–003. It is the rebuttal of this presumption that is commonly referred to as the defence of failure of consideration against an action on a bill of exchange. It follows that we are concerned with the contractual sense of consideration as the exchange of benefit and detriment which combines with offer and acceptance to create an enforceable agreement: see <span class="font-italic">Fielding &amp; Platt Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Selim Najjar </span>[1969] 1 WLR 357; <span class="font-italic">Pollway</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Abdullah </span>[1974] 1 WLR 493. After all, s 27(1) of the Act provides that “valuable consideration” for a bill may be constituted by “any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract” as well as “any antecedent debt or liability”. These principles were summarised by Scott LJ in <span class="font-italic">Churchill and </span><span class="font-italic">Sim v Goddard</span> [1937] 1 KB 92 at 109 and 110:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[V]arious decisions about failure of consideration were cited to establish the well-accepted principle that if the consideration for a bill of exchange wholly fails, then as between immediate parties the contract created by the instrument is discharged and the acceptor released. These authorities also call for no discussion, as there is no doubt as to the principle.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The presence of consideration is not an essential element of a bill of exchange contract as of an ordinary contract not under seal – it is presumed by the Act, and was presumed by our Law Merchant before the Act. But as between immediate parties the defendant is entitled to prove absence of consideration moving from the plaintiff as a defence to an action on the bill, and it is in replication to this defence that it was important for the appellants to point out that the respondent's acceptance recorded the receipt of the consideration, and further that the consideration was in fact given. There can to my mind be no question in the present case that the appellants gave good consideration – i.e., “value” within the meaning of the Act. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 We are therefore not concerned with a failure of consideration, or as some commentators prefer to call it, failure of “basis”, in the sense in which it is used in the law of restitution. In that sense, the term “failure of basis” is said to denote more accurately the negation of the basis for making a payment, and therefore to constitute a ground for restitution or to be an “unjust factor” for reversing unjust enrichment: <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment</span> (Charles Mitchell <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2016) at paras 12–10 to 12–15.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Next, while total failure of consideration is a complete defence to an action brought on a bill of exchange, partial failure of consideration affords a <span class="font-italic">pro </span><span class="font-italic">tanto</span> defence provided it is for a liquidated and ascertainable amount: <span class="font-italic">Byles</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at paras 19<span class="font-italic">–</span>036 to 19<span class="font-italic">–</span>037; <span class="font-italic">Nova (Jersey) Knit Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Kammgarn Spinnerei GmbH</span> [1977] 1 WLR 713 at 720. Some earlier authorities apparently treated the claim on a bill as indivisible, so that partial failure of consideration even if liquidated could not be pleaded as a defence, but the modern law, in the way I have just stated it, is clear: <span class="font-italic">Byles</span> at para 19<span class="font-italic">–</span>037 n 114.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Finally, it would be useful to discuss a case involving a dishonoured cheque in which these principles were applied, namely, <span class="font-italic">Autobiography Ltd v Byrne </span> [2005] EWHC 213 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Autobiography</span>”), which is cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Byles</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 19<span class="font-italic">–</span>011. A wife drew a cheque on a joint account with her husband to meet a debt of a company in which they were both shareholders, and of which the husband was a director. The company then procured for the creditor a bank draft, which was paid, but the cheque was later dishonoured. The wife’s defence against the company’s claim on the cheque was that no consideration had passed from the company. Allowing the claim, the court held that the cheque was supported by consideration because it was unrealistic to suggest that no benefit had been conferred on the wife given her interest in the company. The court emphasised that consideration here had to be viewed in a commercial context, which suggested that the wife did not intend the cheque as a gift to the company. <span class="font-italic">Autobiography</span> thus illustrates that the focus is on determining whether consideration has moved from the drawer, and if the cheque has been issued in a commercial context, that should be taken into account too. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In view of these principles, I turn to consider the defendant’s two arguments. As regards its first argument, it is clear to me, firstly, that the defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Ooi</span><span class="font-italic"> Ching Ling</span> ([100] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is misconceived because that case concerns failure of consideration in the restitutionary, not contractual, sense. Thus, to the extent that the defendant’s argument is premised on restitutionary principles, I reject it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Second, given that the plaintiff did transfer €200,000 into the defendant’s bank account, it cannot be said that no consideration moved from the plaintiff in support of the cheque. If Tahir and Johari later applied those funds for their own personal benefit, that is simply irrelevant to the question whether the cheque was supported by consideration from the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Third, the defendant has not raised the argument that because €200,000 out of the €400,000 was transferred to Tahir and not to the defendant, there was a partial failure of consideration based on an ascertainable amount of €200,000, and it can therefore rely on a <span class="font-italic">pro </span><span class="font-italic">tanto </span>defence that absolves it of liability to pay half the sum in the cheque. But even if this argument were to be raised, I would reject it. It is well-established that while consideration must move from the promisee, it need not move to the promisor, as long as the promisee suffers some detriment at the promisor’s request: Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2015) at para 3<span class="font-italic">–</span>024. Here, the fact that €200,000 went to Tahir and not to the defendant does not change the fact that the plaintiff paid out a sum total of €400,000 as requested by the defendant as consideration for the cheque. I also take into account the commercial context of this case: <span class="font-italic">Autobiography </span>([105] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>); in the light of the clear terms of the agreement, it is inconceivable that the defendant issued the cheque to the plaintiff as a gift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 For these reasons, I reject the defendant’s first argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The defendant’s second argument looks less like an argument that it suffered a failure of consideration and more like an argument that it is entitled to assert an equitable set-off in the value of €200,000 should the plaintiff succeed, or a submission that any judgment for the plaintiff must be coupled with a stay of execution as to €200,000 pending the defendant’s formulation and advancement of a suitable counterclaim. The defendant raised neither possibility. In any event, the former means nothing without an actual counterclaim advanced by the defendant, and the latter was not applied for and need not be considered further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Accordingly, I find that there is no triable issue as to whether the defendant has suffered a total or quantified partial failure of consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 However, as I have found that the defendant has raised triable issues of fraud and illegality, it is nevertheless entitled to leave to defend, in one form or another.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Conditional or unconditional leave</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I now come to the form of the leave to defend which I should grant the defendant. The applicable principles were summarised in <span class="font-italic">Wee Cheng Swee Henry </span>([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [81]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The classic formulation is that conditional leave to defend is the appropriate order when the defendant has succeeded in showing a reasonable probability of a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence which ought to be tried, but that defence is shadowy. Characterising a defence as shadowy is as much a matter of impression as it is of analysis. If one tries to capture that characterisation in words, one can say that a defence is shadowy if the defendant’s evidence is barely sufficient to rise to the level of showing a reasonable probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence. Alternatively, one can say a defence is shadowy if the evidence is such that the plaintiff has very nearly succeeded in securing judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International (HC) </span>at [151], I observed that the cash equivalence principle is deeply embedded in our law, both substantive and procedural. In our procedural law, it means that a court will give summary judgment to a plaintiff suing on a bill of exchange save in exceptional circumstances. The nature of a bill of exchange as a cash equivalent implies, logically and conceptually, that a plaintiff suing on a bill of exchange will almost always come very close to securing judgment against the defendant. That formulation mirrors the language of <span class="font-italic">Wee Cheng Swee Henry</span>. I consider this implication to be a true and accurate description of the plaintiff’s case here. At this stage of the proceedings, it seems to me improbable that the defendant will succeed in showing that the plaintiff, Tahir and Johari fraudulently procured the cheque from the defendant through the instrumentality of the parties’ agreement. As a result, it is appropriate to impose a condition on the defendant’s leave. I come to this conclusion for several reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 First, the defendant has produced no contemporaneous evidence of any form of coordination or correspondence between Lam, Tahir and Johari at or around 13 June 2014 to indicate that they prepared and executed the parties’ agreement in order to defraud the defendant. Instead, the defendant relies only on events after the agreement was concluded as circumstantial evidence of the alleged fraud. In particular, as the assistant registrar observed, there is no evidence that sheds direct light on the plaintiff’s state of mind on 13 June 2014 when the agreement was concluded.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Second, not only is the evidence of fraud not contemporaneous with the parties’ agreement – as one would expect it to be if the defendant’s case on fraud were well-founded – but the evidence is also far from strong. For example, I accept that there is no immediately apparent explanation for the plaintiff’s delay in presenting the cheque. But equally, there is no evidence to show that the defendant, in November 2014, considered the plaintiff’s delay in presenting the cheque as raising a suspicion of fraudulent conduct. For example, the defendant did not react to presentation by telling the plaintiff that it was not entitled to present the cheque or by countermanding the cheque.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Third, fraud on the part of the plaintiff is not a reasonable explanation for the plaintiff’s conduct. To date, the plaintiff is the only party that has suffered any loss under the parties’ agreement. It transferred €400,000 to Tahir and the defendant. It has received absolutely nothing in return. If the plaintiff succeeds in its claim on the cheque, it will recover only the value of the sum it transferred. A fraudster is hardly likely to part with a significant sum of money only to seek its recovery a few months later. By contrast, the defendant cannot point to any value or interest it had in its possession before the agreement which it lost as a result of entering into the agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Accordingly, I also do not regard as credible the assertion contained in a handwritten note allegedly by prepared by Tahir to the effect that it was the plaintiff who defaulted on the parties’ agreement and thus failed to provide the defendant with the necessary bank coordinates.

</div>
</div> If the plaintiff had already discharged the greater obligation of transferring €400,000 to the defendant and Tahir, there is no apparent explanation for why the plaintiff would not have readily discharged the lesser and simpler obligation of providing the defendant the necessary banking coordinates to facilitate the transfer of the €10m under the agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Fourth, the defendant’s own evidence undermines its own case more than it supports it. I consider first the difficulties associated with Tahir’s email dated 22 March 2016. First, while the email suggests that Bala did not know about the parties’ agreement,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-9fc6bef9-84b6-4221-a52d-d935b27f123b" data-toggle="modal" type="button">105</button></sup>

</div>
</div> this does not assist the defendant’s case if Tahir was the managing director of the defendant at the material time and was doing business on behalf of the defendant. That latter fact is not denied by the defendant and is a fact which is consistent with the plaintiff’s case. Second, there is an inconsistency between Tahir’s suggestion in the email that he was not involved in the plaintiff’s attempt to “play” with the defendant on the one hand, and the defendant’s case that Tahir was involved in the conspiracy to defraud the defendant on the other. Third, there is a further inconsistency between Tahir’s assertion in the email that Johari knew about the transaction and Tahir’s statement in a letter dated 25 March 2014

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Van Lynn</span>, the plaintiff took an assignment of the defendant’s debt from a bank and sought summary judgment on the debt. At first instance, the defendant secured leave to defend conditional on securing the entire claim by a payment into court. The English Court of Appeal upheld the decision. It held the notice of assignment to be valid and the defendant’s defences of fraud and conspiracy between the plaintiff and the bank to be without basis and shadowy at best. Insofar as there appears to be more circumstantial evidence in the present case indicative of fraud, that evidence is riddled with holes and inconsistencies. Neither is it correct to say that any defence which is stronger than that in <span class="font-italic">Van Lynn</span> will result in unconditional leave. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Accordingly, while I accept that the defendant has made out a prospect of a defence of fraud or illegality, it is one which falls short of justifying unconditional leave to defend. While the defence is not wholly devoid of substance, the overall impression is such that some demonstration of commitment on the part of the defendant to the claimed defence is necessary: <span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [44].

As O 14 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court anticipates, however, the condition imposed typically requires the defendant to provide security for all or part of the plaintiff’s claim.

</div>
</div> It appears to me that, in light of the usual manner in our procedure by which a condition comes to be attached to leave to defend, the defendant ought to be allowed an opportunity to put evidence of his means before the court, ideally before the assistant registrar but even on appeal to a judge in chambers. As Brooke LJ said in <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Eastern Trust Ltd &amp; Another v </span><span class="font-italic">Kermanshahchi</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 198 at [68]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has always been a feature of the summary judgment procedure that the plaintiff … is unlikely to want to refer to the possibility of a conditional order being made, and the defendant is unlikely, unless pressed, to want to refer to any lack of means when asserting that its defence has a real prospect of success. The former would regard any reference to a conditional order as a sign of weakness because its desire is to persuade the court that the defendant has no real defence. The latter is unlikely to wish to parade its lack of means when contesting the merits of the claim, because this might encourage the court to look more critically into the merits of the defence it wishes to put forward in response to a claim which it knows it cannot pay. In these circumstances a court should not as a general rule make an order of the type made [by the court below] in the absence of any evidence about the defendant’s means unless it is satisfied that the defendant has been given appropriate prior notice, which may be given informally by letter (as opposed to a formal application), to the effect that if the summary judgment application fails the claimant will be seeking a conditional order along the lines set out in the letter. The defendant can then prepare a witness statement as to its means, for production at the stage of the proceedings when the court says it intends to make a conditional order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 However, the defendant bears the burden of fully and frankly disclosing its assets. It is not for the plaintiff to produce evidence of the defendant’s means or even to identify for the defendant the specific manner in which the plaintiff asserts that the defendant’s disclosure is inadequate. Having received and considered the defendant’s evidence of its means, I agree with the plaintiff that that evidence is insufficient to meet the burden on the defendant to avoid any condition whatsoever being attached to its leave to defend. I turn now to consider the parties’ arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The plaintiff advances two principal arguments why the defendant should be ordered to provide security for the full value of the plaintiff’s claim, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $678,016.94. First, the plaintiff submits that the defendant’s ledger accounts exhibited in Bala’s third affidavit show that the defendant has the means to provide the full sum as security.

</div> Second, the plaintiff submits that the further evidence adduced by the defendant is inadequate in three respects: (i) the statements of the defendant’s three bank accounts are only for the month of August 2016 when this action was commenced in February 2016, which raises a concern over whether the defendant has dissipated its assets between those two dates;

But given that even that sum would stifle the defence and the third party proceedings against Tahir and Johari, the court should fix only a “token sum” as the quantum for security.
