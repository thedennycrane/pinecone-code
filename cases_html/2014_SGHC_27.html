<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There
are two appeals and two applications before the court. The two appeals
are against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Paul Chan
(“the AR”) concerning the defendant’s commencement of third party proceedings.
The proceedings arise out of two separate but related actions brought
by Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“AT”). The first, Suit No 477 of 2012
(“S 477/2012”), is brought by AT against Linda Kao Chai-Chau (“Linda”),
who was formerly the managing director of AT from 1996 up to 2012.
Suit 477/2012 is a derivative action brought by Carolyn Fong (“Carolyn”),
a shareholder of AT. The second, Suit No 1015 of 2012 (“S 1015/2012”),
is brought by the Receivers and Managers (“RMs”) of AT. Suit 1015/2012
is brought against Linda and 15 other individuals (including corporate
individuals).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
key legal issue in this case is whether illegality precludes a claim for
indemnity or contribution against a joint tortfeasor. Addressing
this issue requires a proper understanding of the development of
the law pertaining to joint tortfeasorship and the applicability
of case authorities which I will discuss in some detail in this
judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After
hearing the parties, I am allowing the appeals for the commencement
of third party proceedings. Consequently, the two applications to
amend the third party notices are also allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Linda
was appointed as managing director of AT some time in 1996 by its
majority shareholder and then Chairman, Peter Fong (“PF”). PF passed
away on 25 April 2008. Suit 477/2012 is a claim against Linda for breach
of fiduciary duty in respect of certain transactions which mostly took
place whilst PF was still alive and Chairman of AT. After PF’s death, Carolyn
obtained leave to institute a derivative action on behalf of AT against
Linda in respect of these alleged breaches. In granting leave under section
216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”), the High Court
in Originating Summons No 505 of 2010, found that PF was the controlling
mind and will of AT at the material times (see <em>Fong
Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another</em> [2011]
3 SLR 980). The decision of the High Court to grant leave was subsequently
affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The essence of the defence raised
by Linda in S 477/2012 was that the transactions complained of were
carried out in accordance with the instructions of PF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After
S 477/2012 was commenced, Ernst &amp; Young was appointed RMs of
AT on 17 January 2012. The appointment was made pursuant to an application
by Carolyn. A consent order was subsequently granted pursuant to
an apparent agreement between Carolyn and Linda. After their appointment,
the RMs took the view that there was evidence of other diversions
made by Linda and others to the detriment of AT. These largely concern
transactions or events occurring after the death of PF. For this reason,
the RMs commenced S 1015/2012, where it was alleged that Linda and
15 others had been in a conspiracy to divert business away from
AT. A claim was also brought for breach of fiduciary duty. Linda
was, therefore, the defendant in both S 477/2012 and S 1015/2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The <em>modus operandi</em> of the alleged breaches
in the two Suits is similar, the main difference being that they
concern different transactions. Those complained of by the RMs are
mainly concerned with events occurring <em>after</em> the
death of PF. The defence raised by Linda in both actions is similar –
that she had been authorised to act as she did by PF. Different
law firms have been engaged to represent AT in the two Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Given
the multiple actions, I set down certain terms of reference for ease
of understanding. Suit 477/2012 will be referred to as “the Derivative Action”
while Suit 1015/2012 will be referred to as “the RM Action”. I refer to
both suits collectively as “the two Suits”. For the sake of clarity,
the plaintiff in S 477/2012 will be referred to as “AT (Carolyn)”,
while the plaintiff in S 1015/2012 will be referred to as “AT (RM)”.
When needed, I refer to both plaintiffs collectively as “the Plaintiffs”.
The position taken by AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) in respect of the
defence raised by Linda whilst similar is not identical, as will
appear below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural History</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
the Derivative Action, Linda applied by way of Summons No 2990 of
2013 (“SUM 2990/2013”) for leave to serve a third party notice against the
Estate of PF for an indemnity (although there is also a further application
to amend the notice to include a claim for contribution, as will be
elaborated below). AT (Carolyn) objected to the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In
the RM Action, Linda commenced third party proceedings against the
Estate of PF on 19 April 2013. On 12 June 2013, the RMs applied
by way of Summons No 2989 of 2013 (“SUM 2989/2013”) to set aside
the third party proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
AR on 19 July 2013 found for AT (RM) and granted SUM 2989/2013 to
set aside the third party notice. Naturally, he also refused to
grant Linda leave to commence third party proceedings in the claim
brought by AT (Carolyn), thereby dismissing SUM 2990/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Registrar’s
Appeal No 247 of 2013 (“RA 247/2013”) is the appeal by Linda in
the RM Action against the decision of the AR setting aside the third
party notice (I refer to this third party notice as “the Notice
(RM)”). Registrar’s Appeal No 246 of 2013 (“RA 246/2013”) is the
appeal by Linda in the Derivative Action against the AR’s decision
not to grant leave to commence third party proceedings against the
Estate of PF (I refer to this third party notice as “the Notice
(DA)”). The subject matter of the two appeals is largely similar
in nature – the setting aside or the granting of leave to commence
third party proceedings. As mentioned above, there are also two
applications to amend the third party notices – Summons No 4420 of
2013 (“SUM 4420/2013”) to amend the Notice (RM) (which has already been
served), and Summons No 4419 of 2013 (“SUM 4419/2013”) to amend the
Notice (DA) (which has yet to be served). Both amendments relate
to the addition of a claim in contribution (apart from the existing
claim in indemnity).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
two appeals (and applications) were heard before me on 2 September
2013 and 11 October 2013. At the hearing on 2 September 2013, the
matters were adjourned for the parties to prepare further submissions on
the following question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assuming that the Chairman/Director is
the controlling mind, directing will and <em>alter
ego</em> of the Company, does it follow as a matter of law
that any other director who blindly follows the instructions of
the <em>alter ego</em> director will not be
in breach of her fiduciary duty or have any liability in law?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I heard further submissions from counsel on 11 October 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
Estate of PF, which has its own legal representation, has not taken any
part in either Suit. They have not applied to set aside the third
party notices or objected to the commencement of third party proceedings.
For the sake of clarity, after these appeals were heard, AT (Carolyn)
applied for leave to hand over conduct of the Derivative Action
to the RMs. The RMs took a neutral position in this application,
and the matter came before me on 4 November 2013. At the conclusion
of that hearing, judgment was reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below and Linda’s
claim against the third party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Linda’s
defence in the two Suits was based on her assertion that all the transactions
complained of were in fact carried out pursuant to the oral instructions
and/or “understanding” of PF. On this basis, Linda applied for leave
to serve a third party notice against the Estate of PF seeking an indemnity.
In the case of the RM action, Linda actually commenced third party
proceedings against the Estate of PF in which she also sought an indemnity.
As mentioned above, in both actions, Linda also seeks a claim in contribution
from the Estate of PF pursuant to her applications to amend the
third party notices. These amendments were not before the AR in
the hearing below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At
the hearing on 19 July 2013, the AR (delivering oral judgment), found
for AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) on the ground that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is, in my view, impossible for [Linda]
to claim an indemnity or a contribution from [PF] as a matter of
law. An indemnity or contribution will only arise if the court finds
that [Linda] breached her fiduciary duties to AT. If she has so
breached her fiduciary duties, it must also mean that the requisite
knowledge to find liability must be imputed to her. This knowledge would
by itself preclude [Linda] from claiming an indemnity or contribution under
the law of agency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
central point in Linda’s case is that all the “business opportunities”
that she was alleged to have diverted were not in fact business
opportunities for AT. In each case, it is claimed that Linda, acting on
the instructions of PF, had received and disbursed funds “on behalf
of [PF’s] friends and associates as a favour to them”. In relation
to the transactions which were not made on the specific instructions
of PF, Linda’s case is that they were made pursuant to the same
“standing instructions of or understanding of” PF, who was then
the controlling mind and will of AT when the instructions were given
or when the understanding came about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On
this basis, Linda’s primary defence to the two Suits is that there was
no breach of fiduciary or director’s duties owed by her as managing director
to AT. The alleged business opportunities were not the business opportunities
of AT and there could not have been a breach or conspiracy given
that she was merely following the instructions of PF, who was then the
majority shareholder, Chairman and controlling mind and will of
AT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Linda’s
concern, however, was that the court might after the trial find that
she was still liable for breach of her director’s and fiduciary
duties even though she had believed that she was acting pursuant
to the instructions (standing or otherwise) or understanding of
PF. To put the argument at its most basic, there was a possibility
that the court might find (as a matter of law) that Linda’s duties
as a managing director were owed to AT, notwithstanding that PF
was the majority shareholder and Chairman of AT. The trial court
might not necessarily agree that this was a case where PF should
be regarded as the <em>alter ego</em> or
directing mind of AT such that his instructions were effectively
the instructions of AT. Alternatively, even if it is accepted that
PF was the <em>alter ego</em> of AT, it did
not necessarily follow that this would be sufficient to absolve
Linda of her liability for breach of her director’s and fiduciary
duties. That being so, the argument was that Linda had a good basis
for commencing third party proceedings against the Estate of PF
for an indemnity or contribution in the event that she was found liable
notwithstanding the fact that she was found to have acted on the instructions
of PF.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
procedure regarding the issuing of third party notices is found
in O 16 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
(“ROC”), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Third party
notice (O. 16, r. 1)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Where in any action a defendant –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    claims
against a person not already a party to the action any contribution
or indemnity;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    claims against such a person any relief
or remedy relating to or connected with the original subject-matter
of the action and substantially the same as some relief or remedy
claimed by the plaintiff; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    requires that any question or issue
relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the
action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and
the defendant but also as between either or both of them and a person
not already a party to the action,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, subject to paragraph (2), the defendant
may, after having entered an appearance if required to do so under
these Rules, issue a notice in Form 16 or 17, whichever is appropriate
(referred to in this Order as a third party notice), containing
a statement of the nature of the claim made against him and, as
the case may be, either of the nature and grounds of the claim made by
him or of the question or issue required to be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Where
third party proceedings have been commenced, the court possesses
the power to terminate the third party proceedings either upon a third
party’s application for directions under O 16 r 4(3) or at any time under
O 16 r 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In
the present case, it will be recalled that the Estate of PF (the intended
third party) has not applied to terminate the third party proceedings
or to object to the application for leave. The objection instead is
solely from the Plaintiffs. As explained in <em>Singapore
Civil Procedure 2013</em> (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
Maxwell Asia, 2013) (“<em>Selvam on Singapore Civil
Procedure</em>”) at para 16/4/4, if either the plaintiff or
the third party decides to object, evidence is to be adduced by
way of affidavit to support the grounds of the objection. In this
context, it is also stated at para 16/4/5 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… care should be taken that the plaintiff
is not unduly embarrassed or put to additional expense, delay or
difficulty, for he has nothing to do with the questions which have
arisen between the defendant and the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On
this basis, Linda submits that whilst the Plaintiffs are entitled
to object, this can only be on the basis that the third party proceedings
will embarrass or delay AT or are too complicated to be properly
tried within the original action or may result in the action being
unduly delayed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
central argument of AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) is that the third party
proceedings are unnecessary since the claim against the third party replicates
the core of the defence pleaded in the two Suits. To put the matter another
way, if Linda’s claim against the third party is valid, she will
not in any event be liable to the Plaintiff for breach of fiduciary
and director’s duties, or even conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In
the present appeals, the key question is whether Linda has a basis for
seeking an indemnity or contribution against the Estate of PF, which can
survive a finding of liability against her in the main actions.
This question can, for convenience, be broken into a number of (overlapping) subsidiary
questions as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
is it good law that no indemnity or contribution can be claimed
as a matter of law where the relevant acts were known to involve
illegalities? (“Issue 1”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
what is the basis of a claim for contribution or indemnity? (“Issue
2”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
irrespective of the above two questions, are the third party proceedings
for indemnity or contribution in any event redundant on the basis
of an overlap with the pleaded defence in the main actions? (“Issue
3”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     These
questions will now be examined with questions 1 and 2 being addressed
together. For convenience, the position of AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM)
will be discussed together in respect of each issue, followed by
Linda’s position, before proceeding to the next question. It goes
without saying that in discussing the issues raised and the affidavits
that have been tendered, the court acts on the assumption that the
claimed facts are established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues 1 and 2 – the basis of
the claim for indemnity or contribution and whether illegality precludes
any claim for indemnity or contribution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The
illegality relied upon in the present case is both civil and criminal in
nature: conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of director’s
duty and offences under the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
the case of the Derivative Action, the claim was brought in respect of
four business opportunities said to have been wrongfully diverted
by Linda. The claim for contribution/indemnity was made in relation
to only three of these business opportunities. The position taken
by AT (Carolyn) in respect of the pleaded defence and the third
party claim can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     AT
(Carolyn) does not deny that PF was the <em>alter
ego</em> of AT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
said, whilst PF had at the very least “ostensible authority” to
give instructions on behalf of AT, the fact is that PF did not know of
the transactions in question and/or that the transactions were unauthorised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     It
follows that the defence would fail and the claim against the Estate
of PF was redundant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
argument was also raised before the AR that an indemnity could not,
in any case, be claimed in respect of an illegal act: <em>viz</em> an offence under s 157 of the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On
the question of illegality, AT (Carolyn) submitted that the claim against
the Estate of PF was solely based on agency and not joint tortfeasorship.
In the original application for leave to commence third party proceedings
(before the AR), the Notice (DA) was limited to an indemnity and
there was no assertion that PF himself had committed any wrongdoing. The
claim for indemnity was said to have been based solely on the premise that
PF had told Linda to act as she did and, therefore, was under an obligation
to indemnify her for the consequences. Even if PF did in fact instruct
Linda to act as she did, she would still, as a matter of law, be
barred from claiming indemnity on the basis of the public policy
encapsulated in the legal maxim <em>ex turpi </em><em>causa non oritur </em><em>actio</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In
support of the AR’s decision to reject the claim for indemnity as
a matter of law, AT (Carolyn) cited the old common law authority
of <em>Burrows v Rhodes and Jameson</em> [1899]
1 QB 816 (“<em>Burrows</em>”). In that case,
Kennedy J held at 828 that it has:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… long been settled law that if any act
is manifestly unlawful, or the doer of it knows it to be unlawful,
as constituting either a civil wrong or a criminal offence, he cannot
maintain an action for contribution or for indemnity against the
liability which results to him therefrom. An express promise of indemnity
to him for the commission of such an act is void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Thus,
it was argued, even if PF had instructed Linda to act as she did and
even if there was an implied promise to indemnify Linda for the consequences,
she was still not entitled, as a matter of law, to the claim for contribution
or indemnity against the Estate of PF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In
the RM action, AT (RM) advanced similar arguments and they pointed
out that a breach of director’s duty is also a criminal offence
under s 157 of the CA, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000
or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. Other possible
offences referred to were dishonest misappropriation of property
and criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008
Rev Ed). Given the serious nature of these offences, AT (RM) submitted
that the rule in <em>Burrows</em> should
be applied. AT (RM) further asserted that even if Linda could show
that she did not know the acts were unlawful, that would not assist
her case as it was sufficient, if in the capacity of an agent, she
had knowledge of the facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As
mentioned above, in relation to the Derivative Action, there was no
claim for contribution before the AR. Subsequently on 26 August
2013, an application was made to amend the Notice (DA) so as to
state that PF, as a director of AT, had owed the same fiduciary
duties as Linda, and to add an alternative claim for contribution.
There was no pleading that Linda had been misled by PF and that
she might not have known that her conduct was unlawful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
response of Linda to the above arguments is that the right to contribution
relied on was not derived from the common law but from statute.
Section 15(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) provides
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Entitlement
to contribution</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (5), any person liable
in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover
contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same
damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Section
19(2) of the CLA also provides that a person is liable in respect
of any damage if the person who suffered the damage is entitled
to recover compensation from him in respect of that damage (whatever
the legal basis of this liability) whether for tort, breach of contract,
breach of trust or otherwise. Section 16(2) also states that the
trial judge possesses the discretion to determine whether to exempt
any person from contribution or to direct that the contribution
amounts to a complete indemnity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
question as to whether a claim for contribution (which can, in the trial
judge’s discretion, amount to an indemnity) under s 15 of the CLA
is caught by the rule referred to in <em>Burrows</em> has
been considered in a number of Singapore and English decisions.
It is to be noted that ss 15(1), 16(2), 19(2) and 19(6) are <em>in </em><em>para materia</em> with
ss 1(1), 6(1), 7(3) and 2(2) of the Civil Liability (Contribution)
Act 1978 (c 47) (UK) (“the UK Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>K and Another v P and Another</em> [1993] Ch
140 (“<em>K v P</em>”), the plaintiffs brought
an action for damages against the defendants for conspiracy to defraud.
The third defendant issued a third party notice against the accountant
of the plaintiff for contribution or indemnity on the basis that
the accountant had been negligent in failing to warn the Plaintiff of
the risks involved in the defendants’ transactions. The claim for contribution
was based on s 1(1) of the UK Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The
UK Act had replaced s 6 of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors)
Act 1935 (c 30) (UK) (“the LRA 1935”). The latter had created a
right of contribution between joint tortfeasors that was available “where
damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether
a crime or not).” On this basis, Ferris J held that the <em>ex turpi </em><em>causa</em> defence was
not available as an answer to a claim for contribution under the
UK Act. He held at p 149 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The specific purpose of that Act, as
of the Act of 1935 before it, was to enable claims for contribution
to be made as between parties who had no claim to contribution under
the general law. To permit the ex turpi causa defence to be relied
upon as an answer to such a claim would, in my view, narrow to a
substantial extent the deliberately wide wording of section 6(1)
of the Act of 1978 and would, in effect, make a claim for contribution
subject to a condition precedent which is not to be found in the
Act. Moreover, section 2(1) and (2) give the court ample power to
fix the amount of the contribution at a level, including a zero
level, which takes account of all the factors which, in relation
to common law claims, are relevant to the ex turpi causa defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In
Singapore, a similar approach was taken by Judith Prakash J in <em>Nganthavee </em><em>Teriya
(alias Gan Hui Poo) v Ang Yee Lim Lawrence and others</em> [2003]
2 SLR(R) 361 (“<em>Nganthavee</em>”). In
that case, a claim was brought by the plaintiff and BC Tan (her
husband) in separate proceedings against the directors of two Singapore
companies for misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty and conspiracy. Third party proceedings were commenced against
BC Tan for an indemnity or contribution. The third party proceedings
were objected to on a number of grounds, including the argument
of illegality. The claim for contribution was based on (the then
applicable) s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLA
1994”), which is similar to s 6 of the LRA 1935. Section 11 provides for
a right of contribution between joint and several tortfeasors whenever damage
is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime
or not). Prakash J accordingly held (at [17]) that the third party
claim against BC Tan was not precluded on the basis that BC Tan,
if liable, was liable as a party to the conspiracy. Even if the
tort was a crime, s 11 permitted a claim for contribution. That
said, the learned judge also exercised the power set out in s 11(2)
to exempt BC Tan from making contributions, as otherwise the defendants
would be able to retain part of the wrongfully acquired benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
decision of Prakash J did not concern ss 15 and 16 of the CLA. These
provisions amended and replaced s 11 of the CLA 1994 but were not applicable
since the new provisions only applied to events occurring after
1 January 1999. The learned judge was aware of the new provisions
but did not make any specific comment on them. That said, Prakash
J discussed at length the case of <em>K v P</em> in
arriving at her decision. In the circumstances, I have no doubt
that the position in Singapore today is the same as that expressed
in <em>K v P</em> – a claim for contribution
under ss 15 and 16 of the CLA is <em>not affected</em> by
any illegality (tortious or criminal) tainting the transactions
or events. A right to seek contribution is provided for in all cases
against a person who is liable in respect of the same damage – whether that
liability is joint or otherwise. Neither does it matter whether
the basis of that liability for the same damage is in tort, breach
of contract, breach of trust or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In
reaching this decision, I am reinforced in my view by the fact that in
the Parliamentary debates on the amendments to the CLA 1994, the Minister
of State for Law (Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee) observed that the
amendments were intended to bring Singapore’s law on contribution
in line with the UK Act and to address anomalies in litigation practice.
See <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
Report</em> (26 November 1998), vol 69 at cols 1694–1698 (Associate
Professor Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3 – Whether the third
party proceedings are in any case irrelevant or redundant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     AT
(Carolyn) also took the point that quite apart from the question
of illegality, the third party proceedings were in any event redundant
as they were nothing more than a reproduction of the position taken
in the defence. Cases cited in support included <em>Yemen
Salt Mining Corp v Rhodes-Vaughan Steel Ltd</em> (1976) Carswell
BC 141 (“<em>Yemen</em>”) and <em>Westcoast Transmission Co v Interprovincial Steel
&amp; Pipe Corp</em> (1985) Carswell BC 48 (“<em>Westcoast</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     
          <em>Yemen</em> concerned a suit brought by Y against
S for negligence in the manufacture of a pipe delivered within Ontario.
The pipe had been transported under the supervision of SW, who was
Y’s agent. SW had also inspected and tested the pipe. S sought to
bring third party proceedings against SW for an indemnity or contribution.
SW was said to be liable to contribute on the basis that it had
been negligent during the transportation and testing process. At
the third party directions stage, the proceedings were set aside
on the ground that the basis of the claim against the third party
was the same as the defence raised in the main action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The
case of <em>Westcoast</em> involved similar
facts, where a claim was made against the manufacturer for damages
arising out of a failed pipe. The third party, H, had been retained
to inspect the pipe during the manufacturing process. The plaintiff
initially sued both the defendant and H for breach of contract and
negligence. Subsequently, the claim by the plaintiff against the third
party was settled. At this stage, the defendant instituted third
party proceedings against H for contribution. There was no contract
between the defendant and the plaintiff. In striking out the third
party proceedings, the court, citing <em>Yemen</em>,
commented that if H had been acting as an agent of the plaintiff
(in carrying out the inspection), any fault of H would be attributable
to the plaintiff (through the doctrine of vicarious liability) in respect
of the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. That being so, any fault
by H would already be attributed to the plaintiff for the purpose
of reducing its scale of recovery against the defendant. The argument
that H might have acted outside the scope of his authority from
the plaintiff, thereby relieving the plaintiff from vicarious liability,
was not accepted. The point had never been pleaded. Indeed, the
defendant had always taken the position that H was, at all times,
acting as an agent for the plaintiff. That being so, the third party
claim was in this sense redundant as the acts of the third party
would be attributable to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     AT
(Carolyn), in its submissions, relied on the above Canadian High Court
decisions as well as the decision of Prakash J in <em>Nganthavee</em> that
was discussed earlier. It will be recalled that, in the latter case,
a claim was brought by the plaintiff and BC Tan (her husband) in
separate proceedings against the directors of two Singapore companies
for misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty
and conspiracy. Third party proceedings were commenced against BC
Tan for an indemnity or contribution on the basis that BC Tan was
a co-conspirator. Whilst Prakash J accepted that illegality was
not itself a bar to the claim for statutory contribution, the proceedings
against BC Tan as a third party was redundant. At [24], the learned
judge commented that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In any case, if he had been a co-conspirator,
since it was admitted that [the third party] was the [plaintiff’s]
agent, [the plaintiff] would not be able to succeed in her action
against the [defendants]. Once this point was brought up as a point
of defence and proved it would completely defeat the plaintiff’s claim
and there could be no issue between the [defendants] and the third party.
As [counsel for the plaintiff] submitted, because [the third party]
was the plaintiff’s agent and <em>alter ego</em> in
the matters relating to Europa, there was no separate issue to be
tried whether of indemnity or contribution or otherwise between
the [defendant] and the [the third party]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Reference
has also been made to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Yong Kheng Leong and another v Panweld Trading Pte
Ltd and another</em> [2013] 1 SLR 173 (“<em>Panweld</em>”)
(where the appeal was dismissed and the decision of the High Court
was upheld). The plaintiff, Panweld, had brought an action against
the directors for breach of fiduciary duties. The claim was based
on the assertion that the first defendant (a director) had placed
his wife on the payroll for some 17 years when she was not in fact
an employee of Panweld. The defendant director issued a third party
notice against L, another director who was also the majority shareholder
at that point in time. The basis of the claim for contribution was
that L had approved the payments. Before the High Court, Steven
Chong JC held that there was no merit in the third party action.
On appeal, Sundaresh Menon JA (as he then was) agreed and held at
[84] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the third party claim against [L] had
absolutely no merit. If [L] had agreed to the salary payments, then
[the defendant director] would not be liable in the first place.
On the other hand, if [L] had not agreed to this, then there would
be no basis for seeking any indemnity or contribution from [L].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On
the basis of these decisions, AT (Carolyn) submitted that, with reference
to the pleadings, Linda would have to prove the same facts in order
to succeed in her defence and her third party claim. However, in
the event that she succeeds in the defence, the third party claim
would be redundant. Meanwhile, if her defence fails, the third party
claim will likewise not be able to succeed. In the written submissions,
AT (Carolyn) accepts that PF did have, at the very least, ostensible
authority to act on behalf of AT – that is to give instructions
to Linda. Whether he did in fact do so was the centre piece of both
the defence and the third party claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In
the RM Action, AT (RM) took a similar stand and also submitted that
the third party proceedings were not necessary. AT (RM) further submitted
that whilst an action to strike out a third party claim is typically brought
by the third party, there is nothing which prevents the plaintiff
in the main action from taking that step. In support, AT (RM) relied
on O 18 r 19 of the ROC which provides that a court may, at any
stage of the proceedings, order a pleading to be struck out on these
grounds: (a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; (b) it
is scandalous, frivolous and/or vexatious; (c) it will prejudice,
embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; and (d) it is an
abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     AT
(RM) submits that <em>Nganthavee</em> applies
since Linda’s defence was that she did not commit any of the alleged
breaches because she was complying with the directions of PF who
was the <em>alter ego</em> (or controlling mind
and will) of AT. Instructions from PF were to be treated as the instructions
of AT. AT (RM) also asserts that if Linda’s position is that PF and
AT are not one and the same (in order to validate the third party claim),
Linda would be adopting contrary positions. For completeness, it
is noted that AT (RM) has also submitted (in their closing submissions)
that the claim, as set out in the third party notice, was inherently
improbable. To this end, why would PF, as the alleged <em>alter ego</em> and controlling mind of AT, instruct
Linda to commit acts against AT such that AT would lose almost its entire
business?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The
question, therefore, is whether the third party claim by Linda against
the Estate of PF is redundant – in other words, is there any basis upon
which Linda might fail in her defence in the main action brought
by AT and yet, on the same facts, still have grounds to succeed
in her claim for contribution from the Estate of PF? Linda’s defence
to the main actions in the two Suits is that she did not commit
any of the alleged breaches since all the impugned transactions
were carried out on the instructions or directions of PF. If that
can be established as a matter of fact, Linda submits that she will
not be liable for breach of duty on the basis that PF was the <em>alter ego</em> or controlling mind and will
of AT. If it is assumed that the facts alleged by Linda can be established,
the question of law as to whether this absolves her from any claim
by AT will have to be decided. Whilst the High Court, in granting
leave to Carolyn to commence the Derivative Action, has held that
PF was the controlling mind and will prior to his demise, this was said
in the context of the leave application. Until the evidence is heard
and the issues are properly ventilated, there is no telling whether
the trial judge will come to a similar conclusion on the evidence
placed before the court. In any case, even if PF, as the majority
shareholder and Chairman of AT, had instructed Linda to act as she
did (to the apparent detriment of AT), this will not necessarily,
as a matter of law, absolve Linda from liability vis-à-vis AT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     AT
(RM) submitted, in their closing submissions, that even if PF had directed
the conspiracy to be perpetrated (and was in breach of his own duties
owed to AT), Linda, as the managing director, owed an independent duty
to AT. To merely follow the instructions of the Chairman (and majority
shareholder) may not relieve her from that duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The
basis of the claim for contribution in the two Suits, as stated above,
is founded on s 15(1) of the CLA. To succeed, it is necessary to
show that another person (<em>ie</em>, the
third party) is liable in respect of the “same damage”. In this
case, the damage would be the losses sustained by AT as a result
of the business diversions. The claim for contribution does not
have to be based on joint tortfeasorship. Section 15(1) of the CLA
makes it clear that contribution can be sought even against another
party who is severally liable for the same damage. If Linda is found
liable in the main actions, this will be on the basis that she has
breached her director’s and fiduciary duties in carrying out the
transactions. This could be because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
trial judge finds that PF did not in fact know of or consent to the
transactions; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     even
if he did, his consent was not sufficient, as a matter of law, to
absolve Linda from performing her independent duties owed to AT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It
is in the latter case, that Linda appears to have some grounds for seeking
contribution from the Estate of PF. PF, being the Chairman and director
of AT at that point in time, would also have owed a fiduciary duty to
AT. Whether or not he was in breach or is absolved because he was
the <em>alter ego</em> of the company is
a matter that can only be determined at trial. Even though leave
was granted to commence the Derivative Action against Linda, the
possibility remains that the trial judge will find that, at the material
time(s), PF was not the <em>alter ego</em> (or
indeed the majority shareholder). The possibility remains that the
trial judge will find that PF, by directing Linda to act as she
did, was himself in breach of his fiduciary duties. If so, this
will result in a situation where two persons, the managing director
and the Chairman, are in breach of fiduciary duties such as to cause losses
to AT. It is for such an eventuality that Linda seeks to commence third
party proceedings against the Estate of PF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The
factual question remains as to whether the possibilities referred
to above are fanciful or inherently so improbable that they should
not be taken into account. As far as the question as to whether
PF was either the <em>alter ego</em> or controlling
mind and will of AT is concerned, AT (Carolyn) does accept that
PF, at least, possessed ostensible authority to direct Linda to
act. That said, Linda has submitted that AT (Carolyn) has not in
its pleadings admitted that PF was either the <em>alter
ego</em> or controlling mind of AT. On this point, it must
be noted, however, that the response of counsel for AT (Carolyn)
was that it was accepted that PF was the <em>alter
ego</em> and controlling will of AT <em>up
till his death</em> and that this was the position taken before Prakash
J in <em>Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore)
Pte Ltd and another</em> [2011] 3 SLR 980 (the application
for leave to commence derivative proceedings). In the RM action,
AT (RM) has, on the other hand, expressly denied that PF was the <em>alter ego</em> or controlling mind of AT. Linda,
in her closing submissions, pointed out that PF was not the sole
shareholder or even a major shareholder of AT since 2006. That was
when it is said PF had transferred the majority of his shares to
the Fong Foundation charitable trust. At the date of his death,
the point is made that PF only held 3.6% of the shares while the
Fong Foundation held some 51%. The rest of the shares were held
in varying amounts by 11 other persons including Carolyn who had
owned 6.2% of the shares. It will be recalled that the RM Action
was largely in respect of transactions said to have taken place <em>after</em> PF’s death. That said, the transactions
raised in the Derivative Action appear to be largely concerned with
events taking place <em>before</em> his death,
indeed before 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     If,
at trial, the court finds that at the material times (<em>ie</em>, when the transactions were carried
out), PF despite his shareholding was not to be treated as the <em>alter ego</em> or controlling mind of AT (such
that his acts can be treated as AT’s acts), it must follow that
Linda may well be in breach of her duties even if she proves that
she had acted with PF’s knowledge and consent. On the other hand,
Linda also submits that in the event PF is found to be the controlling
mind of AT, it does not follow that, as a matter of law, PF was
free to do whatever he wished with AT’s assets and business. Reference
was made to the English case of <em>In re W &amp;
M Roith Ltd</em> [1967] 1 WLR 432. That was a case where R
held more than two-thirds of the shares and was the controlling
spirit of the plaintiff company which he had founded. R directed
the company to sign a covenant to pay his wife an annual pension
after his death. The court found that the covenant was not made <em>bona fide</em> for the benefit of the company.
In reaching this conclusion, Plowman J noted that there was no evidence
of any other director explaining the reasons for the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In
any case, a question also arises as to what it means to be regarded
as the “controlling mind” or “moving spirit” or “<em>alter
ego</em>” of a company. Linda submitted that the key element
is such that the person has “singular control” and who is, in substance,
carrying out his own business through the company. For this proposition,
the High Court decision of <em>Lim Leong Huat v
Chip Hup </em><em>Hup </em><em>Kee Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R)
318 (“<em>Lim Leong Huat</em>”) was cited.
In that case, Andrew Ang J, in passing, commented at [29] that even
where a business is managed solely by one person, that one person
and the company are in law, nevertheless, separate legal entities. This
statement was made in relation to the question of whether a combination
between a director and the company could form the basis of a conspiracy.
Issues as to whether a director/shareholder is the <em>alter
ego</em> or controlling mind can arise in cases where an outsider
(such as a trade creditor) sues the company for a debt and wishes
to lift the veil of incorporation in order to establish personal
liability against the director/shareholder. It may also be relevant
in the context of determining the state of mind of a company. Indeed,
this issue also arises in the context of whether a director may
be held personally liable for the torts of the company. The question
can also arise in cases where it is the company itself which wishes
to bring a claim against a defaulting director. Such was the case
in <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> where an application
was made to join the controlling director as second defendant on
the basis that he was a co-conspirator with the company. Andrew
Ang J, at [22], cites (with approval) <em>Walter
Woon on Company Law</em> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell,
3rd Ed, 2005) at para 3.106, which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Where the person who represents the company’s
directing mind is acting in fraud of the company, his knowledge
or intention will not be imputed to the company where the company
is suing its officers in respect of breach of their duties. Thus,
where the directors of a company conspire to defraud the company,
the company is not a party to the conspiracy even if the directors
in question are its ‘brain’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For
this reason, the learned judge concluded, and with respect, rightly so,
at [23], that where the company is a victim of a conspiracy of its directors
and sues the directors in respect of breach of duties, the company does
not become a co-conspirator with its directors merely because its directors
are the conspirators. The position is different where the company and
its directors were in an established arrangement which benefited
the company to the detriment of third parties. Here, Andrew Ang
J commented at [24] that the company would no longer be the victim.
Instead, the third party is the victim of the alleged conspiracy
between the company and its directors. There was, applying <em>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture
Ltd and Others</em> [1979] Ch 250, no reason why the assets
of a limited company and/or that of its errant director, even one
who was the controlling mind of the company, should not be made
liable to answer for conspiracy. English cases taking a similar
line include <em>Attorney-General’s Reference (No
2 of 1982)</em> [1984] QB 624 which dealt with the issue of whether
a person in total control of a limited liability company (by reason of
shareholding and directorship) is capable of stealing the property
of the company. Given that AT (RM)’s position is that Linda, as
the managing director, owed an independent fiduciary duty to AT,
Linda has submitted that the court might find that even if PF gave
her instructions (as Chairman and major shareholder), that she could
not (as a matter of law) act on those instructions without breaching
her duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     AT
(Carolyn) also relied on the principle that it was trite law that
a director can avoid liability for breach of fiduciary duty by making
a full disclosure to the company: that is to say the shareholders
of the company. It was argued that following <em>Panweld</em>,
no actual shareholder resolution was needed – it would be sufficient
if all shareholders did assent to the course of action. In <em>Panweld</em>, there were only two director
shareholders of a company. The company brought an action against
the first director shareholder for placing his wife on the company’s
pay roll even though she was not an employee. The first director
shareholder applied for a third party notice against the second
director shareholder. The application was dismissed on the basis
that in the event the second director shareholder had agreed to
the payments, the first director shareholder would have obtained the
consent of all the shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In
the case of the Derivative Action, Linda, however, points out that PF
and Linda collectively only held 17.2% of the shares at the date
of PF’s death. Prior to that, in 2006, some 51% of the shares had
been transferred to the Fong Foundation charitable trust. The remaining
shares, at the date of death, were held by various family members.
This included Carolyn Fong who had owned 6.2% of the shares. It
follows that the line of cases similar to <em>Panweld</em> does
not provide much assistance on the facts of this case. In relation
to the RM Action, the transactions that were complained of occurred
largely <em>after</em> the death of PF, at
a point in time when PF’s shareholding had already been greatly
reduced. With regard to the Derivative Action, whilst the relevant
transactions had occurred mainly <em>before</em> PF’s
demise (some time before 2006), it does not appear that PF and Linda
had owned all the shares in AT at the relevant times. The first
claim, for which contribution is sought, concerns alleged diversions
of business opportunities from Chinese chemical companies. It is
asserted that the diversions took place between 2000 to the date
of the writ. The second claim, for which contribution is also sought,
is in respect of diversions from another Chinese company from around
2001. The third claim relates to acts occurring around 2002 and
2004. It has been said that all the shareholders and directors of
AT were, in general, content to acquiesce in PF’s management of
AT whilst he was alive and that if a shareholders’ meeting had been
called, they would “probably have voted in favour of Peter Fong’s proposals”.
It was also submitted that the reality of family-run companies is such
that the directors and shareholders are understandably content to acquiesce
with the founder <em>alter ego</em>, at least
whilst he is still alive and personally managing the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Whilst I have sympathy for the argument,
and whilst it is acknowledged that the alleged degree of acquiescence
may be proved at trial, it is not clear at this stage that this
will <em>inevitably</em> be the position.
Even though Linda has herself referred to PF as the controlling
mind of AT, it does not follow that all the shareholders would have
necessarily agreed with all the transactions in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I,
therefore, found that the third party notices were not redundant, although
the grounds for the third party notices shared primarily the same facts
as Linda’s defence in the two Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     For
the avoidance of doubt, in arriving at the above decision, I have noted
the submissions made by AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) concerning the delay
and expense that will arise from the third party proceedings. That said,
I am satisfied that there is a close connection between the main
action against Linda in the two Suits and her claim for contribution
from the Estate of PF. In these circumstances, I am of the view
that the third party proceedings should be allowed such that the
issues can be properly ventilated in the interest of all concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discretion of the trial court
and contribution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The
point has been mentioned above that under s 16(2) of the CLA, the
court enjoys the power in any such proceedings for contribution,
to exempt a person from liability to make contribution. For example,
if it should transpire that the result of a successful claim for
contribution is such that the defendant is unjustly enriched in
respect of the gains, the court may very well decide that this is
an appropriate case to exercise the discretion. Indeed, this was
a possibility that Linda recognised in her submissions. The point
made, however, was that this was a decision which could only be made
by the trial court after all the facts and issues had been fully
ventilated and decided upon, including the question of any benefit
received by Linda. Other factors which may have a bearing on the
exercise of this discretion after the trial might include those
touching on <em>ex turpi </em><em>causa</em>. Whilst I am sympathetic to the
argument by AT (RM) that this matter can be decided today, especially
in light of the result in <em>Nganthavee</em> where
the discretion was exercised, in my view, it will be fairer and
more appropriate for this issue to be addressed at the end of the
trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application to amend the
third party notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Given
my decision on the availability of third party proceedings in respect
of Linda’s claim for contribution, I am also granting the applications
to amend the third party notices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
appeals (RA 246/2013 and RA 247/2013) are allowed. The applications
by Linda to amend the relevant third party notices (SUM 4419/2013
and SUM 4420/2013) are also allowed. I will hear parties on costs at
a later date.</p>
