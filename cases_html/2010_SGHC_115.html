<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involves a disgruntled Plaintiff who
                    has sued her former insurance company for alleged breach of contract. The
                    Plaintiff has also sued her former lawyer for alleged collusion with the
                    insurance company. The insurance company has in turn counterclaimed against the
                    Plaintiff, based on the allegedly defamatory contents of an online web log set
                    up by the Plaintiff. All parties have applied <em>inter
                        alia</em> to strike out each others’ claims. After hearing
                    parties’ submissions, I struck out the Plaintiff’s claims and
                    dismissed her application for summary judgment against both defendants. I now
                    give the reasons for my decision.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I will deal with the applications in the same
                    order as they appear above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of factual history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff is a Singapore citizen. The 1st
                    Defendant is an insurance company incorporated in Hong Kong and registered in
                    Singapore. The 2nd Defendant is a practicing lawyer in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dispute concerning Critical Year feature with the 1st
                Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sometime in 1993, the Plaintiff purchased a
                    “Singapore Financial Guardian” life insurance policy from the 1st
                    Defendant. This policy was for an assured sum of S$200,000.00, for which the
                    Plaintiff would pay an annual premium of S$3,883.00 (“the
                    Policy”). The Plaintiff was entitled to receive dividends from the Policy
                    every year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Policy included a Critical Year feature,
                    which refers to the projected last year in which the Plaintiff would have to
                    make out-of-pocket annual premium payments. After the Critical Year point, the
                    annual premiums would be paid from the Policy's declared and accumulated
                    dividends. The Policy would effectively be self-sustaining, and the Plaintiff
                    would not need to make any further out-of-pocket payments for the annual
                    premiums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before purchasing the Policy, the Plaintiff met
                    with a representative of the 1st Defendant, one Oscar Huang
                    (“Oscar”). The Plaintiff was given a document, which she refers to
                    as an “Original Policy Quotation” and which the 1st Defendant
                    refers to as a “Policy Benefit Illustration”. The document itself
                    does not bear either title. In this judgment, I will refer to the document as an
                    “Original Policy Quotation” (“OPQ”). My adoption of
                    the Plaintiff’s terminology does not translate into an acceptance of her
                    arguments concerning this document's effect, for reasons that follow in this
                    judgment. A copy of the OPQ is enclosed as an annex to this
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The OPQ provides numerical values for items such
                    as annual premiums paid, current year dividends and cash surrender values. These
                    values are provided for a 30-year period. The OPQ expressly states
                    “CRITICAL YEAR : 16”. The OPQ also expressly states that future
                    dividends are not guaranteed, and that the interest rates reflected are not
                    guaranteed and are for illustration purposes only. The values contained in the
                    OPQ were for an insured sum of S$100,000.00, and the annual premium value stated
                    in the OPQ was S$2,091.50</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After receiving the OPQ from Oscar, the
                    Plaintiff submitted an application form to the 1st Defendant on or about
                    14 May 1993. In her application form, the Plaintiff requested for an
                    insurance policy with an assured sum of S$200,000.00. The premium payable under
                    the Policy was S$3,883.00. The Policy also stated that “(t)his policy and
                    the application for it, a copy of which is attached to and made a part of the
                    policy, constitute the entire contract”. The application form submitted
                    by the Plaintiff also contained a declaration, which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“No statement, information or agreement made or given by or to the
                        person soliciting or taking this application or by or to any other persons
                        shall be binding on the Company, unless reduced to writing, and then if
                        presented to and approved by an officer specified in the
                        policy”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff claims that her Policy would
                    have reached the Critical Year point in 2008, after which she would no longer
                    need to make any out-of-pocket annual premium payments. In 2008, the Plaintiff
                    claims that she received a letter from the 1st Defendant informing her that she
                    would need to continue making premium payments until the age of 85, instead of
                    the age of 45 as allegedly stated in the OPQ. In other words, the Plaintiff
                    would have to continue making premium payments after 2008. The Plaintiff wrote a
                    letter to the 1st Defendant saying that she no longer needed to make any
                    out-of-pocket premium payments. In support of her contention, she sent the 1st
                    Defendant a copy of the OPQ and other documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The 1st Defendant replied to the Plaintiff to
                    inform her that according to their records, she had purchased an insurance
                    policy for S$200,000.00 and that the projected Critical Year point for her
                    Policy was 15 years. These values were different from those contained in the OPQ
                    submitted by the Plaintiff, which was for a sum of S$100,000.00 and had an
                    illustrated Critical Year of 16 years. The Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant
                    continued to exchange correspondence throughout 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Between November and December 2008, the
                    Plaintiff contacted and communicated with Mr Amarjeet Singh S.C., who had
                    been appointed in 2003 by the 1st Defendants as the Independent Adjudicator for
                    claims relating to Critical Year policies. This adjudication process ultimately
                    proved futile, because the Plaintiff refused to sign the Independent
                    Adjudicator's Request for Adjudication Form. The Independent Adjudicator's
                    office therefore informed the Plaintiff that there would be no adjudication
                    meeting, and that Mr Amarjeet Singh S.C. would have no jurisdiction over
                    the matter because she refused to sign the Request for Adjudication
                Form.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff's Blog</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 13 October 2008, the Plaintiff set up
                    an online web log at the internet address
                    http://AIAInsuranceDispute.BlogSpot.Com (“the Blog”). She claimed
                    that it was to share with other affected investors her findings on her dispute
                    with the 1st Defendant concerning the Policy and its Critical Year feature. The
                    Plaintiff also claimed that she had emailed the entire contents of the blog to
                    the 1st Defendant prior to its activation. On 7 November 2008, the 1st
                    Defendant's solicitors issued a letter to the Plaintiff and demanded that she
                    de-activate the Blog. On 10 November 2008, the Plaintiff de-activated the
                    blog and informed the 1st Defendant's solicitors by email of its
                    de-activation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-payment of premiums in 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In March 2009, the Plaintiff wrote to the 1st
                    Defendant to instruct the latter to pay her policy premium for the year 2009
                    from the Policy’s dividends. The 1st Defendant in turn requested the
                    Plaintiff to sign and complete several forms. However, the Plaintiff took issue
                    with a portion of the form titled "DECLARATION AND AUTHORISATION". She deleted
                    this portion, and returned the form to the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant then
                    wrote back to the Plaintiff and informed her that her request to use her
                    dividends to pay the Policy's premiums could not be processed if she defaced the
                    prescribed forms. This issue was not resolved despite lengthy correspondence
                    between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. It appears that the Plaintiff did
                    not pay any premiums due for her Policy in 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff's dealings with Engelin Teh Practice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In February 2009, the Plaintiff engaged a law
                    firm, Engelin Teh Practice ("ETP"), with a view to sue the 1st Defendant for
                    breach of contract. After discussing the case with the Plaintiff and reviewing
                    documents provided by her, ETP informed the Plaintiff that the OPQ was not
                    sufficient. The Plaintiff has pleaded in her statement of claim that ETP
                    informed her that "the surrender value of the policy in the OPQ is based on the
                    non guaranteed interest rate of 7%. As such, and in essence, the surrender value
                    contains a non guaranteed element as well": <em>paragraph 223 of the Statement of Claim</em>. ETP informed the
                    Plaintiff that her claim would depend on whether Oscar had represented to her
                    that the interest element was guaranteed. It is not disputed that Oscar did not
                    inform the Plaintiff that the interest rate was guaranteed. The Plaintiff has
                    pleaded that it was "impossible" for Oscar to have stated that the interest rate
                    was definite: <em>paragraph 226 of the Statement of
                        Claim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     ETP also informed the Plaintiff that her
                    allegations of the 1st Defendant's misconduct could be defamatory. While ETP was
                    prepared to address the Plaintiff's claims concerning the Critical Year dispute
                    in a letter of demand against the 1st Defendant, ETP was not prepared to include
                    the Plaintiff's allegations of misconduct without clear and incontrovertible
                    evidence: <em>paragraph 238 of the Statement of
                        Claim</em>. The Plaintiff was dissatisfied with ETP's proposed
                    approach for the case. She directed ETP on 4 February 2009 to stop any
                    activities on her case, and to wait for her further instructions. The Plaintiff
                    and ETP continued to correspond until at least 19 February 2009. ETP is not
                    a party in the present case, and had stopped acting for the Plaintiff by May
                    2009 at the latest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff's dealings with the 2nd Defendant </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In May 2009, the Plaintiff engaged the 2nd
                    Defendant to act for her against the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff claims that
                    the 2nd Defendant told her that he would prepare a draft Writ of Summons before
                    29 May 2009. The Plaintiff also provided the 2nd Defendant with a "detailed
                    document" titled "Introduction of my insurance dispute with AIA", in which she
                    explained the "whole story of the dispute": <em>paragraph 331 of the Statement of Claim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 29 May 2009, the 2nd Defendant
                    informed the Plaintiff that he had been busy and would need more time to
                    complete the draft Writ of Summons. On 5 June 2009, the 2nd Defendant
                    emailed a draft Writ of Summons to the Plaintiff. The draft was a short
                    document, comprising 11 paragraphs. The draft stated that the Plaintiff and the
                    1st Defendant had come to an agreement in 1993 on the Policy, which was
                    evidenced by the OPQ, the Policy Contract Documents and correspondence between
                    the parties. The draft stated that the 1st Defendant had wrongfully repudiated
                    the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the 2nd
                    Defendant's draft. On 8 June 2009, she wrote to the 2nd Defendant stating
                    that "The way you wrote did not benefit my case, but otherwise. As such, I will
                    get someone else to do it and take my case. Let me know if you have any
                    explanation on the matter". The 2nd defendant replied the next day to say that
                    it was the Plaintiff's prerogative to do so, and requested for payment of
                    S$1,800.00 as estimated costs for drafting the writ of summons. The Plaintiff
                    refused to pay this sum to the 2nd Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The various claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 16 June 2009, the Plaintiff filed her
                    writ of summons against both defendants. The Plaintiff's claim against the 1st
                    Defendant is for liquidated damages of S$1,146,885.00, and for unliquidated
                    damages of S$800,000.00, or for such sum or sums as the Court may find due. This
                    is based on resulting losses due to premature termination, breach of contract
                    and "serious inappropriate doings and misconduct by the 1st Defendant":
                        <em>paragraph 376 of the statement of claim</em>.
                    The Plaintiff's claim against the 2nd Defendant is for unliquidated damages in
                    the sum of S$50,000, or for such sum or sums as the Court may find
                due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The 1st Defendant has counterclaimed against
                    the Plaintiff for defamation arising from the contents of her Blog. The 1st
                    Defendant has prayed for an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from publishing
                    the Blog, and for damages to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     SUM 4895, 4926 and 4952 of 2009 were heard on
                    11 November 2009. Judgment was reserved for all three applications. SUM
                    5561 was heard on 2 December 2009. After the Defendants had completed their
                    submissions and the Plaintiff was making her reply submissions, she asked for
                    the hearing to be adjourned in order to file a further affidavit in reply to the
                    2nd Defendant’s affidavit (which had been filed on 18 November 2009).
                    I refused to further adjourn the hearing, and directed the Plaintiff to complete
                    her submissions. At the end of the hearing, I directed parties to appear before
                    myself on 15 December 2009 for judgment to be delivered for all applications. I
                    also gave the Plaintiff leave to file a reply affidavit by 9 December 2009,
                    limited to the contents of the 2nd Defendant’s affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Plaintiff appealed against my order
                    granting her leave to file a reply affidavit. This appeal was heard before a
                    Judicial Commissioner in Chambers on 30 December 2009. The Judicial

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This case was fixed for hearing before me for
                    delivery of judgment on the four applications on 1 March 2010. Parties were
                    informed on that date that a written judgment would be issued, and that
                    attendance will not be necessary. I directed parties to appear for a hearing on
                    7 April 2010 for judgment to be delivered, and to hear any submissions on
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUM 4895 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This is the 1st Defendant's application for a
                    determination under O 14 r 12 on whether the OPQ has contractual
                    effect and/or is enforceable against the 1st Defendant, and the interpretation
                    of the OPQ. In this application, the 1st Defendant has also asked that the
                    Plaintiff's claim be struck out pursuant to O 14 and/or O 18
                    r 19.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Under O 14 r 12, the Court may
                    determine the construction of any document where it appears to the Court that
                    such question is suitable for determination without a full trial of the action,
                    and such determination will fully determine the entire cause or matter or any
                    claim or issue therein. The Plaintiff's case is that the terms of the OPQ alone
                    are sufficient to prove that it is a guaranteed, binding contract. The Plaintiff
                    has specifically pleaded that Oscar did not tell her that the OPQ and its
                    associated Critical Year values were guaranteed. This document is the basis of
                    the Plaintiff's entire claim against the 1st Defendant. Moreover, there are no
                    issues of fact, or of mixed fact and law, relating to the determination of the
                    OPQ's effect. I therefore find that the OPQ is suitable for determination under
                    O 14 r 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant differ in
                    their description of the document provided by Oscar for obvious reasons. The 1st
                    Defendant refers to the document as an “illustration” in order to
                    deprive it of contractual effect, while the Plaintiff refers to it as a
                    “quotation” for the converse effect. I have declined to refer to
                    the document as a mere illustration because I am of the view that such a
                    description may obscure the crucial issue, namely whether the document is
                    capable of contractual effect. I should add that calling the document a
                    “quotation” does not bestow contractual effect either. The OPQ
                    must still meet the requirements of a valid contract, in order to have
                    contractual effect. These requirements were by the Court of Appeal in <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another
                        appeal</em> [2009] SGCA 3 at [47] to [48]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>First</em>, there must be an
                        identifiable agreement, which is complete and certain. Essentially, this
                        means that negotiations between the parties must have crystallised into a
                        contractually-binding agreement in which there is no uncertainty as to the
                        terms of the contract concerned. The traditional tools of analysis centre
                        around the concepts of offer and acceptance. An "offer" has been described
                        as follows (see M P Furmston, <em>Cheshire, Fifoot and
                            Furmston's Law of Contract</em> (Oxford University Press, 15th Ed,
                        2007) ("<em>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston</em>") at
                        p 40):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An offer, capable of being converted into an agreement by acceptance,
                            must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain
                            specified terms are accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An "acceptance" has been described as follows (see Edwin
                        Peel, <em>Treitel: The Law of Contract</em> (Sweet
                        &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) ("<em>Treitel</em>") at
                        para 2015):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the
                            terms of an offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">48 An "offer" must be distinguished from an "invitation to treat". The
                            former has already been defined above (at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>). The latter, on the other hand, is simply an
                            attempt to initiate negotiations, to induce offers; hence, a response to
                            an "invitation to treat" can never result in a concluded contract.
                            Although there are decisions illustrating specific instances of
                            "invitations to treat", the distinction between an "offer" on the one
                            hand and an "invitation to treat" on the other is, at bottom, a question
                            of the <em>intention</em> of the party concerned
                                (<em>viz</em>, whether his or her intention was
                            to make "a definite promise to be bound provided that certain specified
                            terms are accepted" (an offer; and see above at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>) <em>or</em> merely attempting
                            to induce offers instead (an invitation to treat)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contractual effect of the OPQ</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having regard to the requirements for a
                    binding contract, I find that the OPQ does not have contractual effect. First,
                    the OPQ was not an offer. It is clear from its terms that it does not contain
                    any definite promise to be bound. Moreover, the OPQ is fundamentally uncertain
                    as it is replete with undefined terms, such as “CD”,
                    “CSV” and “terminal dividends”. Second, there was no
                    acceptance by the Plaintiff, even if the OPQ is assumed to be an offer. The
                    Plaintiff never sent any final and unqualified expression of asset to the terms
                    of the OPQ. Whereas the OPQ was for an insured sum of S$100,000.00 with an
                    annual premium of S$2,091.50, the Plaintiff's application to the 1st Defendant
                    for a Policy was for an insured sum of S$200,000.00 with an annual premium of
                    S$3,883.00. Even if the Plaintiff's application is taken to be an
                    “acceptance”, there was no assent to the OPQ's terms. Third, there
                    are no grounds for me to conclude that either party had any intention to be
                    bound by the terms of the OPQ. At best, the OPQ was provided by the 1st
                    Defendant to induce the Plaintiff to enter into a contract for purchase of
                    insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interpretation of whether the OPQ's values are guaranteed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The 1st Defendant has also asked for a
                    determination of the OPQ's interpretation. On this question, I find that the
                    values stated in the OPQ are not guaranteed. I further find that this is obvious
                    from the terms of the OPQ itself. As explained by the 1st Defendant's counsel
                    during oral submissions, the OPQ sets out the Critical Year feature in the
                    following manner: the Plaintiff is expected to pay S$2,091.50 in premiums every
                    year. Each year, the 1st Defendant will pay a dividend to the Plaintiff, the
                    value of which is reflected at column 3 of the OPQ. This figure is added to any
                    dividends previously paid under the policy, together with any accumulated
                    interest. This total annual figure is reflected at column 4 of the OPQ. After 16
                    years, the OPQ anticipates that the Plaintiff would no longer have to make any
                    out-of-pocket payments for the annual premium. The sum of S$2,091.50 would be
                    covered by applying that year's dividend payments (column 3) towards payment of
                    the premium, with any shortfall in the premium payment being taken from the
                    accumulated cash dividends (column 4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Critical Year feature relies on two
                    components: the amount of annual dividends paid to the Plaintiff under column 3,
                    and the size of the accumulated cash dividends under column 4. If the dividends
                    actually paid out are lower than reflected in column 3, then there will be a
                    greater reduction of the sum in column 4 in order to service the annual premium.
                    Conversely, if the dividends paid out are higher than reflected in column 3,
                    then there will be a lesser reduction of the sum in column 4. In order for the
                    projected 16-year self-sustaining point to be guaranteed, the figures reflected
                    in columns 3 and 4 of the OPQ must also be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is immediately obvious that the figures in
                    columns 3 and 4 are not guaranteed. Note (1) of the OPQ expressly states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The dividends are based on current scale. Future dividends are not
                        guaranteed.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     This shows that the values in column 3 –
                    which is titled “Current Year Dividend” – are not
                    guaranteed. This alone is sufficient for me to find that the OPQ, and its
                    16-year self-sustaining Critical Year feature, cannot be guaranteed. This
                    accordingly means that the figures in column 4 are also not guaranteed, as they
                    are based on the accumulation of the amounts reflected in column 3. Moreover,
                    the interest rate applied in column 4 is expressly stated at note (3) of the OPQ
                    as “not guaranteed”, and is “used for illustration purposes
                    only”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Plaintiff's argument on this point is that
                    the OPQ only stated that the dividends and interest rate are not guaranteed and
                    did not state anything else as not guaranteed. As such, “it is believed
                    that anything else is guaranteed”: <em>paragraph 32
                        of the statement of claim</em>. The Plaintiff argues that if the
                    values in columns 3 and 4 were not guaranteed, then the 1st Defendant would have
                    expressly said so. This was based on a comparison of the OPQ's terms with
                    subsequent documents that were used by the 1st Defendant, which clearly stated
                    that the dividend payouts were not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I agree with the Plaintiff that the OPQ is
                    less clear than the 1st Defendant’s subsequent documents. Counsel for the
                    1st Defendant explained that these new documents were used to make it
                    “even clearer” that the values were not guaranteed, and this was
                    because the 1st Defendant was a “caring company”: <em>page 14, lines 2 to 4 of the record of proceedings dated
                        11 November 2009</em>. I do not agree that the 1st Defendant's
                    case is weakened by its subsequent remedial measure of issuing clearer
                    documents, rather than continuing to rely on the OPQ. This is precisely why Rule
                    407 of the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence excludes evidence of subsequent
                    remedial measures as proof of an admission of fault in negligence and product
                    liability claims. I accept that there is no equivalent evidentiary rule in
                    Singapore, and that the present case is not a negligence or product liability
                    claim. However, I find no reason to ignore the rationale for such a rule: a
                    defendant should not find that he is prejudiced in a pending legal action,
                    simply because he chooses to improve his product or implement measures to
                    prevent future incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Plaintiff has argued that the OPQ does not
                    state what “the dividends”, “current scale” and
                    “future dividends” means in relation to its note that dividends
                    are not guaranteed. The Plaintiff has similarly argued that the OPQ has not
                    explained how the non-guaranteed interest rate would affect the figures under
                    column 4. I find these arguments to be without merit. As explained above, it is
                    apparent from the OPQ's contents that the disclaimer is relevant to the values
                    in columns 3 and 4. Even if this could have been stated with greater clarify,
                    this does not change the fact that the OPQ does not purport to guarantee any of
                    the values that form the basis of the 16-year Critical Year
                feature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Enforcement of the OPQ against the 1st Defendant </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Having found that the OPQ does not have
                    contractual effect and that the figures contained within are not guaranteed, I
                    turn to the question of whether it can nevertheless be enforced against the 1st
                    Defendant. In this respect, I find that the OPQ's terms cannot be enforced
                    against the 1st Defendant. This is because of the entire agreement clause
                    contained in the Policy contract between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant.
                    The clause states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“This policy and the application for it, a copy of which is
                        attached to and made a part of the policy, constitute the entire
                        contract.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The application form submitted by the
                    Plaintiff contained the following declaration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“No statement, information or agreement made or given by or to the
                        person soliciting or taking this application or by or to any other persons
                        shall be binding on the Company, unless reduced to writing, and then if
                        presented to and approved by an officer specified in the
                        policy.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is not disputed that the terms of the OPQ
                    are not part of the Policy or the application form that constitutes the contract
                    between both parties. It is also not disputed that the OPQ's terms had not been
                    presented to or approved by any of the 1st Defendant's specified officers. I
                    thus find that the entire agreement clause contained in the Policy precludes the
                    enforcement of the OPQ's terms against the 1st Defendant. It bears repeating
                    that the OPQ is for the insured sum of S$100,000.00, whereas the Policy issued
                    to the Plaintiff was for an insured sum of S$200,000.00. Given the significant
                    difference between the documents, I find that the OPQ was nothing more than a
                    pre-contractual representation, used by Oscar to illustrate the potential
                    benefits of purchasing insurance coverage from the 1st Defendant. In the
                    presence of an entire agreement clause, such pre-contractual representations are
                    necessarily precluded. This was noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another
                        appeal</em> [2007] SGCA 22 at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Entire agreement clauses appear as a smorgasbord of variously worded
                        provisions. <em>The effect of each clause is essentially a
                            matter of contractual interpretation and will necessarily depend upon
                            its precise wording and context</em>. Generally, such clauses are
                        conducive to certainty as they define and confine the parties' rights and
                        obligations within the four corners of the written document thereby
                        precluding any attempt to qualify or supplement the document by reference to
                        pre-contractual representations. (emphasis in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Striking out application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In summary, I find that the OPQ does not have
                    any contractual effect between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. I further
                    find that values stated in the OPQ are not guaranteed, in particular the
                    dividend values in columns 3 and 4. I find that the Plaintiff is precluded from
                    relying on the OPQ's terms against the 1st Defendant by virtue of the entire
                    agreement clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is not disputed that the OPQ is the basis
                    for the Plaintiff's entire claim against the 1st Defendant. In light of my
                    determination of the OPQ's effect, interpretation and enforceability, I find
                    that the Plaintiff has no remaining cause of action against the 1st Defendant. I
                    accordingly exercise my discretion under O 14 r 12(2) and dismiss the
                    Plaintiff's claim against the 1st Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUM 4926 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This is the 2nd Defendant's application to
                    strike out the Plaintiff's claim against him, on the basis that it discloses no
                    reasonable grounds of action under O 18 r 19(1)(a). The 2nd Defendant
                    argues both in written and oral submissions that the Plaintiff's claim against
                    him is based on the tort of conspiracy, with the sole or predominant purpose to
                    injure. The 2nd Defendant therefore relies on the case law requirements for a
                    properly pleaded case of conspiracy, and argues that the Plaintiff has failed to
                    meet these requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Plaintiff's statement of claim runs to a
                    total of 81 pages, containing 381 paragraphs. In this voluminous document, there
                    is only one sentence that indicates the nature of the Plaintiff's claim against
                    the 2nd Defendant: “In addition, the Plaintiff makes claims against the
                    2nd Defendant for unliquidated damages due to his inappropriate conduct”:
                        <em>paragraph 381 of the statement of claim</em>.
                    The Plaintiff did not plead the nature of the alleged “inappropriate
                    conduct”. The only other indication of the nature of the Plaintiff's
                    claim against the 2nd Defendant was the heading text at page 65 of the
                    Statement of Claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The 1st and 2nd Defendant were suspected to colluded (sic) on the
                        Plaintiff's case; a problematic draft of the writ of summons”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In her reply, the Plaintiff made it clearer
                    that she was alleging collusion between the 1st and 2nd Defendants. She pleaded
                    at paragraph 76 of the reply:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The Plaintiff avers that there was collusion between the 1st
                        Defendants and the 2nd Defendant”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It is trite law that in an O 18
                    r 19(1)(a) application, the Court will consider whether there is a cause of
                    action with some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are
                    considered: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em> [2007] at
                    18/19/6 and 18/19/10, see also <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v
                        Wee Chong Jin</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649. Having carefully
                    considered the Plaintiff's statement of claim, I find that there no reasonable
                    cause of action has been pleaded. I am mindful that striking is a draconian
                    measure, and that the Court will allow a plaintiff to proceed with the action
                    unless the case is wholly and completely unarguable: <em>Tan Eng
                        Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 844 at [31].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I am nevertheless satisfied that the
                    Plaintiff's case against the 2nd Defendant should be struck out as it is wholly
                    devoid of merit. The Plaintiff's case against the 2nd Defendant is properly
                    characterised as wholly and completely unarguable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First, the statement of claim does not give
                    any indication of the legal basis for the Plaintiff's claim against the 2nd
                    Defendant. The vague references to “inappropriate conduct” and
                    “suspected to colluded” fall far short of establishing any
                    purported cause of action. The presumably rhetorical questions found in the
                    reply asking “If there was no collusion, why...” also fall short
                    of establishing any cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Second, even if the Plaintiff's case is
                    elevated to the status of a coherently pleaded conspiracy claim, the facts
                    relied on by the Plaintiff do not support such a claim. As explained earlier in
                    this judgment, the statement of claim does not support any allegation of
                    collusion. In her reply, the Plaintiff justified her claim of collusion between
                    the 1st and 2nd Defendants on the following grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The 2nd Defendant intentionally provided a
                            problematic draft of the writ of summons, which was “contrary and
                            contradictory” to what the Plaintiff had told him and what was
                            contained in the <em>Introduction of my insurance dispute
                                with AIA</em> document: <em>paragraph 77
                                of the reply</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The draft writ of summons was “full of
                            mistakes and errors” and was “ambiguous and hideous
                            messy”: <em>paragraph 79 of the
                                reply</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The draft writ of summons was “written in
                            the way for the 1st Defendants to defend, defeat and strike out
                            effortlessly”: <em>paragraph 80 of the
                                reply</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The draft writ of summons did not contain any
                            content relevant to the wrongdoings and misconduct by the 1st

                            reply</em>.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is not disputed that the Plaintiff's
                    allegations of collusion are based entirely on the draft writ of summons
                    prepared by the 2nd Defendant. In making these allegations, the Plaintiff
                    appears to have lost sight of a basic fact: the draft writ of summons was
                    exactly that – a draft. It is clear from the pleaded correspondence that
                    the 2nd Defendant had no intention of filing any writ of summons without prior
                    approval of its contents by the Plaintiff. In particular, the 2nd Defendant had
                    no intention of filing the disputed draft in its current form. He specifically
                    informed the Plaintiff that the writ of summons would be issued “after we
                    have gone through a few more drafts”: <em>paragraph 363 of the statement of claim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     If the Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the
                    contents of the present or any future drafts, she could have instructed the 2nd
                    Defendant to amend the draft. It is inconceivable that the 2nd Defendant would
                    be able to file a statement of claim that would intentionally damage the
                    Plaintiff's interests under such circumstances. Moreover, I find no basis for
                    the Plaintiff's argument that the mere preparation of a draft writ of summons is
                    sufficient evidence of collusion between the 1st and 2nd
                Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For the above reasons, I find that the
                    Plaintiff has failed to prove any collusion between the 1st and
                    2nd Defendants. Additionally, the law on conspiracy by unlawful means
                    requires proof of intention to injure or damage the Plaintiff, while conspiracy
                    by lawful means requires proof of a predominant purpose to cause injury or
                    damage to the Plaintiff: <em>Quah Kay Tee v Ong and Co Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 at [45]. I accept that proof of
                    such intention or predominant purpose can be inferred from facts: <em>Recordtv Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd and
                        others</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 43; [2009] SGHC 146.
                    However, there is nothing in the draft's language that allows me to infer any
                    intention or purpose to cause injury or damage to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Even if there was potentially damaging
                    language contained in the draft, the fact remains that the Plaintiff was sent a
                    copy of the document and the 2nd Defendant intended to go through future drafts
                    with her. The Plaintiff could thus have easily prevented the inclusion of
                    potentially damaging language. The Plaintiff's allegation that the 2nd Defendant
                    intended to damage her case is based on a flawed, impractical and ultimately
                    fictional scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Plaintiff has further relied on the fact
                    that the 2nd Defendant used terms such as “agreement”,
                    “repudiation” and “repayment” in the draft:
                        <em>paragraph 369 of the statement of claim</em>.
                    The Plaintiff argues that since she did not tell the 2nd Defendant to use these
                    specific terms, they must have come from the 1st Defendant and are therefore
                    evidence of collusion. I find this argument to be fundamentally flawed. The
                    terms “agreement”, “repudiation” and
                    “repayment” are standard terms found in most contractual disputes.
                    Having gone through the wording of the draft, I find that there is nothing
                    sinister about how these terms were used, and do not support the Plaintiff's
                    allegation that their presence in the draft amounts to evidence of collusion.
                    While I accept that the Plaintiff is not expected to know that such terms are
                    standard contractual terminology, her status as a layperson does not and cannot
                    save this patently unmeritorious argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Third, the Plaintiff has no basis to claim
                    unliquidated damages in the amount of S$50,000.00 against the 2nd Defendant.
                    Neither the pleadings nor the affidavit evidence show how this figure was
                    derived. When specifically asked to explain how she had come up with the
                    $50,000.00 figure, the Plaintiff replied:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I am a layperson. I just decide to claim this amount. The Court
                        will know how much will be decided. I don't know how to decide. I put this
                        amount according to my grievance.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is obvious that the Plaintiff had no basis
                    to plead unliquidated damages of $50,000.00 against the 2nd Defendant. The
                    Plaintiff admitted during oral submissions that this $50,000.00 was arbitrary,
                    in that she had come up with the figure and had not based it on anything else
                    like a contract or receipt: <em>page 22, lines 5 to 9 of the
                        record of proceedings dated 11 November 2009</em>. Under the
                    circumstances, I am of the view that it would be an abuse of process to allow
                    the Plaintiff to maintain her claim for such damages against the 2nd Defendant.
                    This is especially in light of the fact that the Plaintiff has failed to plead
                    any reasonable cause of action against the 2nd Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I should add that during oral submissions, the
                    Plaintiff did not assert that she was relying on the tort of conspiracy in her
                    claim against the 2nd Defendant. Instead, she repeatedly stated that her claim
                    against the 2nd Defendant was based on breach of trust: <em>pages
                        18 and 20 of the notes of proceedings dated 11 November
                    2009</em>. This is a completely different cause of action from conspiracy,
                    and no elements of breach of trust have been pleaded in the Plaintiff’s
                    Statement of Claim and Reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the above reasons, I find that the
                    Plaintiff's pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action against the 2nd
                    Defendant. I therefore exercise my discretion under O 18 r 19(1)(a) to
                    strike out the Plaintiff's claim against the 2nd Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUM 4952 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     This is the 1st Defendant's application for
                    summary determination under O 14 r 12 for the natural and ordinary
                    meaning of the Plaintiff's defamatory statements pleaded in paragraph 22 of
                    the defence and counterclaim. The 1st Defendant had originally prayed for
                    judgment to be entered against the Plaintiff, in that the Plaintiff be enjoined
                    from publishing the Blog and its contents, and for damages to be assessed. The
                    1st Defendant has agreed to restrict the scope of the present application to a
                    determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the allegedly defamatory
                    statements, and will consider the prayer for injunctive relief at a later stage
                    pending the outcome of the Court's summary determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The present application therefore has a narrow
                    focus. It is concerned only with the natural and ordinary meaning of the
                    allegedly defamatory statements. The question of whether the statements were
                    true – and therefore whether the Plaintiff is able to avail herself of the
                    defence of justification – forms no part of SUM 4952/2009. That can be
                    determined at later proceedings or at trial, such as was done in <em>Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and Others v Basil Anthony
                        Herman</em> [2009] SGHC 214.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The natural and ordinary meaning of allegedly
                    defamatory words is a question that is suitable for determination under
                    O 14 r 12(1), as long as such determination would fully resolve the
                    issue as to the meaning of the words of the action: <em>Microsoft
                        Corp and others v SM Summit Holdings Ltd and another and other
                        appeals</em> [1999] SGCA 72. I find that the allegedly
                    defamatory statements in the present case are suitable for determination under
                    O 14 R 12(1), as such a determination will in fact fully resolve the
                    issue as to the meaning of the statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I find that the statements pleaded by the 1st
                    Defendant are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning. The 1st
                    Defendant has reproduced 10 statements taken from the Plaintiff’s Blog in
                    its defence and counterclaim. At paragraph 23 of the defence and
                    counterclaim, the 1st Defendant has pleaded a specific meaning for each of the
                    ten statements. I find that most of the statements bear the natural and ordinary
                    meaning pleaded by the 1st Defendant. For statements where I do not agree with
                    the 1st Defendant's pleaded meaning, I have determined such statements to bear a
                    lesser defamatory meaning. This is in line with the Court of Appeal's holding in
                        <em>Microsoft Corp and others v SM Summit Holdings Ltd and
                        another and other appeals</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 465;
                    [1999] SGCA 72 that in a defamation action, so far as the meaning of
                    the words is concerned, the only question before the judge is whether the words
                    complained of bear the defamatory meaning as pleaded or some lesser defamatory
                    meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The test for determining the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the offending words in a defamation action has been
                    comprehensively set out by the Court of Appeal in <em>Review

                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">What would the words mean to an ordinary

                            experience – the ordinary, reasonable person reads between the
                            lines;</div>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The meaning that was intended by the statement's

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The meaning must be gathered from the words
                            themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are

                            events which would reasonably be in the mind of the ordinary reasonable

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     To the above principles, I would add the High
                    Court's reminder in <em>Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua
                        Benjamin</em> [1997] SGHC 243 that the source of the words
                    matters: nuances which may be elicited from words uttered by the village idiot
                    are very different from nuances which may be elicited from the same words
                    uttered by an experienced politician or diplomat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     If the natural and ordinary meaning of the
                    words would tend to lower the claimant in the estimation of right-thinking
                    members of society generally, then such words are defamatory. This includes
                    words that convey a negative first impression to the ordinary reasonable person,
                    even if he might subsequently correct himself on that impression: <em>Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em> [1997]
                    3 SLR(R) 46; [1997] SGHC 243</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I now apply the above principles to the
                    disputed statements in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st Defendants were lying when they said that they did not keep
                the Plaintiff's PBI as “it is impossible that the [1st Defendants] does not
                keep OPQ” and that this was “so that customers have no evidence to
                argue with [the 1st Defendants]”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     This statement was an amalgamation of two
                    different portions in the Plaintiff’s blog. For clarity, I set out the
                    full context in which these portions appear, and in their same order of
                    appearance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“AIA knows very clearly what an OPQ promised to the customer. But,
                        AIA hides the OPQ of all affected policies and lied that it does not keep
                        them so that customers have no evidence to argue with AIA. Further, AIA
                        disclaims the OPQ if a customer keeps it. AIA uses every excuse not to admit
                        the OPQ if the customer keeps it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">AIA claimed that it does not keep OPQ because it was not then an industry
                        regulatory requirement to file a copy in its records at the time the policy
                        was sold. However, AIA lied because AIA keeps critical year (CY) and AIA is
                        ISO 9002 certified company. It is impossible that AIA does not keep
                        OPQ.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I accept that the natural and ordinary meaning
                    of these statements is that the 1st Defendant was fraudulent. This is obvious
                    from the Plaintiff's repeated assertion that the 1st Defendant has been telling
                    lies, in order to deprive its customers of evidence. An allegation of fraudulent
                    acts is clearly defamatory: <em>DHKW Marketing and another v
                        Nature's Farm Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 774;
                    [1998] SGHC 359.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The 1st Defendant has also pleaded that this
                    statement also means that the 1st Defendant had intentionally cheated its
                    customers. I do not accept that intentional cheating is part of the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of <u>this</u> statement. These
                    portions of the Blog state that the 1st Defendant lied to its customers, and no
                    reference is made to cheating. Lying is not synonymous with cheating. It is
                    entirely possible to lie without cheating, though it is admittedly difficult to
                    cheat without lying. I am of the view that the ordinary reasonable person is
                    able to draw a distinction between being lied to, and being cheated. I note that
                    the Blog does state that the 1st Defendant has been “using a cheating
                    process”, “there is a suspicion to mislead and cheat”,
                    “had the intention to cheat us” and “dared to lie and cheat
                    me in writing”. However, the 1st Defendant has not pleaded any of these
                    statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st Defendants “made a very big lie to affect policy
                holders that [the 1st Defendants] does not keep the OPQ of affected policies. But,
                [the 1st Defendants] actually keeps them and hides them”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I accept that the natural and ordinary meaning
                    of this statement is that the 1st Defendants were lying, and that such meaning
                    is defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">If the 1st Defendant did not keep the Plaintiff's PBI, “I do
                not know how [the 1st Defendants] could be ISO 9002 certified”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I do not accept the 1st Defendant's submission
                    that the natural and ordinary meaning of the above is that the 1st Defendants
                    were unbefitting of their ISO 9002 certification and/or had fraudulently
                    obtained the aforesaid certification. This statement gives the impression that
                    the 1st Defendants have failed to comply with ISO 9002 requirements. Thus, the
                    natural and ordinary meaning of this statement is that the 1st Defendant has not
                    met its ISO 9002 obligations. While this meaning does amount to defamation as a
                    statement that would create a negative impression in the mind of an ordinary
                    reasonable person, I am of the view that such defamatory impact is
                    minimal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st Defendants disclaims its valid business orders and were
                guilty of “serious wrongdoings” for which the Plaintiff allegedly
                found many “strong evidences and facts against [the 1st
                Defendants]”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The above statement is taken from the
                    introductory heading to the Blog. For clarity, that introduction is set out in
                    full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I spent eight months to do research on AIA Life Insurance Dispute,
                        which AIA called as critical year (CY) issue. I found many serious
                        wrongdoings of AIA. I collected strong evidences and facts against AIA,
                        which are applicable to all affected policies. Let us band together to sue
                        AIA.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I note at the outset that this introductory
                    heading does not state that the 1st Defendant “disclaims its valid
                    business orders”. I therefore do not accept the 1st Defendant's
                    submission that this statement means that the 1st Defendants repudiated their
                    contractual obligations owed to their customers. However, I accept that the
                    natural and ordinary meaning of this statement is that the 1st Defendants were
                    guilty of many serious wrongdoings, and such wrongdoings were conclusively
                    proved by the strong evidence in the Plaintiff's possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Plaintiff's reference to having
                    “strong evidences (sic) and facts against the 1st Defendant”
                    relating to the latter's “serious wrongdoings” is
                    defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st Defendants are “very creative and
                “brave” to provide information in the way it likes without considering
                the OPQ. Can AIA do so? Isn't it wrongdoing?”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I agree that the natural and ordinary meaning
                    of this statement is that the 1st Defendant was devious and bold. It is clear
                    that the words “creative” and “brave” are not used
                    in their literal, laudatory sense. The ordinary reasonable reader would read
                    between the lines and detect the sarcasm with which these terms have been used.
                    The 'sting' of sarcasm is in the reasonable inference to be drawn: <em>Bored Piling (Pte) Ltd v James Siow Lai Huat &amp; Ors</em>
                    [1996] SGHC 248. In the present case, that inference is that the 1st
                    Defendant was devious and bold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I also find that the natural and ordinary
                    meaning includes that the 1st Defendant were guilty of wrongdoing. The ordinary
                    reasonable reader would again realise that the question “Isn't it a wrong
                    doing?” is purely rhetorical, and is meant to convey the negative
                    impression that the 1st Defendant had in fact committed
                wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st Defendants “modifies” customer's critical year
                (CY) illegally with its bad intention. [The 1st Defendants] provide wrong
                explanations on OPQ, use irrelevant options to supersede OPQ, and many
                more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">I suspected that [the 1st Defendants] modified many policies' CY if
                not all</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     For both of the above statements, I find that
                    the natural and ordinary meaning is that the 1st Defendant had acted
                    fraudulently by tampering with its customers' Critical Year terms. This is
                    defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">“[i]t is surprising that [the 1st Defendants] dared to lie in
                order not to admit my OPQ. It should be very serious offence (sic) to illegally
                modify a customer's policy data, I believe”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I find that the natural and ordinary meaning
                    of this statement is that the 1st Defendant had acted fraudulently by lying, and
                    by illegally modifying its customers' policy data. This is
                defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">“Is [the 1st Defendants] trying to mislead and cheat
                us?”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I find that the ordinary reasonable reader
                    would infer from this rhetorical question that the 1st Defendant was in fact
                    attempting to mislead and cheat its customers, and had thereby acted
                    fraudulently. This is defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">People were “misled by [the 1st Defendants]”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is necessary to set out the full extract
                    from the Blog in which the above statement appears:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Some people may not know that they are affected. Some people know
                        the issue and may have accepted an unfair option from AIA. But, they may not
                        know the truth. They are misled by AIA.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I find that the natural and ordinary meaning
                    of this statement is that some customers have been misled by the 1st Defendant.
                    These customers may have accepted an unfair insurance option from the 1st
                    Defendant. I do no agree with the 1st Defendant's submission that this statement
                    conveys an impression of a “widespread practice” of pretence
                    and/or fraud. However, I do accept that the statement means that the 1st
                    Defendant has acted fraudulently by misleading its customers, and that this
                    meaning is defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff's submissions on the meaning of the disputed
                statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     During the course of oral submissions, the
                    Plaintiff did not address the natural and ordinary meaning of the disputed
                    statements. Instead, she argued that the disputed statements were not defamatory
                    because they were true: <em>page 26 of the notes of
                        proceedings dated 11 November 2009</em></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">“P:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">1st Defendant spent a lot of time to
                            elaborate the meaning of the sentence and how it is defamatory. But he
                            did not answer the allegations raised in the statements. When I tell the
                            truth, then how can it be defamatory, unless what I allege is wrong.
                            Then that is defamatory. But if what I write is all the facts, that is
                            not defamatory.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Plaintiff does not understand the
                    difference between whether the dispute statements are defamatory in their
                    natural and ordinary meaning, and whether the defence of justification applies
                    to the present case. During the hearing, I explained to the Plaintiff that the
                    truth of the allegations is not directly relevant to the present application,
                    which is concerned only with the meaning of the disputed statements. I further
                    explained to the Plaintiff that the truth of her allegations may be relevant at
                    later proceedings. I accept that the Plaintiff is acting in person, and does not
                    appear to be legally trained. However, I was unable to put any weight to her
                    oft-repeated argument that the disputed words were not defamatory simply because
                    they were true. This argument is fundamentally misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I specifically asked the Plaintiff for her
                    arguments on whether an ordinary person would conclude that the 1st Defendant
                    was a wrongdoer when reading each disputed statement. I did so in order to give
                    the Plaintiff the opportunity to address the issue of whether the statements had
                    any defamatory effect. It was necessary for me to do so because the Plaintiff
                    refused to budge from her assertion that the statements were not defamatory if
                    they were true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Plaintiff replied that she did not know
                    what an ordinary person would think when reading the disputed statements. She
                    also claimed that when writing the Blog, she never thought of how a reader would
                    think of its contents, or of how a reader would think of the 1st
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I find the Plaintiff's claim that she never
                    thought of the reader's reactions when reading the Blog to be patently false.
                    The emails sent by the Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant's general manager and
                    customer service department shows that she was acutely aware of the potential
                    reactions of the public after reading the Blog:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I tried to set up my BLOG just now so that you could read it in
                        the morning when you start the next working day …Over the weekend,
                        the full version should be ready for interested people to know the whole
                        story of AIA life insurance dispute. Next week, many Singapore and overseas
                        websites will publish them. Very soon, the dispute will be getting hot. When
                        it is hot, class action would follow if it is what you expected.”:
                        email dated 10 October 2008, 1:06 AM</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I will continue to do what I should do until I received
                        satisfactory compensation from AIA: my BLOG shall be set up, all the
                        information shall be released to the public, etc. Time is important to you
                        and me.”: email dated 10 October 2008, 9:21 PM</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Since you agree to settle the dispute through one-off
                        compensation, I will not open by BLOG to the public and will shut it down if
                        we can reach an agreement on the compensation amount by Midnight of Tuesday.
                        If not, I have no choice but open the BLOG to the public. I can be sure that
                        it will be getting hot and popular very soon once it is open. Nowadays,
                        internet, emails and SMS are very powerful tools to pass and share
                        information. In Singapore, there are NUS, NTU and 12 research institutes,
                        where your agents often go to look for potential customers. Just a few
                        emails can make all of them know the dispute. Plus broadcasting, it should
                        be soon that Singapore residents will know the dispute … I worry
                        about your agents who have spent 10 years, 20 years or more of their career
                        with AIA. They would lose what they have built up through the years if AIA
                        is in troubles.”: email dated 13 October 2008, 1:27 AM</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I understand that AIA is going to be sold. But, how to get a good
                        price if the scandal of AIA is getting popular and hot Tomorrow.”:
                        email dated 14 October 2008, 8:49 PM</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     For the above reasons, I found the Plaintiff's
                    arguments in response to the present application to be either untrue or
                    misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUM 5561 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The Plaintiff’s grounds for applying to
                    strike out the 1st Defendant’s defence and counterclaim, and the 2nd
                    Defendant’s defence, mirror her grounds for resisting the
                    Defendants’ respective striking out applications. I have already found
                    those grounds to be either misconceived or unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     One final point should be addressed in
                    relation to the Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendants have no defence
                    to her claim. The Plaintiff has repeatedly stated that the Defendants have no
                    defence because they did answer her questions or address her allegations in
                    affidavit form. This is seen in the following extracts from the
                    Plaintiff’s written submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In their Defence and Counterclaim, the 1st Defendants denied
                        and/or did not admit almost all the events that have taken place since 2003
                        and all my allegations through bare denials when they have no basis to deny
                        … In their 1st affidavit that they filed to strike out my case and my
                        claim, they left out almost all the issues, matters and causes of action
                        that I raised in this action. They did not disclose the whole story to the
                        Court. They did not answer my questions … I served the 1st Defendants
                        my 1st and 2nd affidavits and my application to strike out their Defence and
                        Counterclaim. They did not reply. They did not show cause against my
                        striking out application. They have no argument and no
                        defence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In my 1st and 2nd affidavits, I provided sufficient evidences to
                        support and prove my allegations on their wrongdoings and misconduct. After
                        I served the 1st Defendants my 1st and 2nd affidavits, they did not reply.
                        If they have good answer, they definitely would have filed their reply
                        affidavit to tell the Court. But till today, the 1st Defendants did not
                        provide any evidences or particulars to prove that my allegations on their
                        wrongdoings and misconduct are not true. Apparently, they have no arguments
                        on my allegations and no defence to my claim.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I raised many questions and allegations on his wrongdoings and
                        misconduct in my Statement of Claim. But, he did not answer. In his Defence,
                        he did not answer my questions by using the excuse that he sees neither
                        reason nor obligation to answer them … But, if he did nothing wrong
                        and did not collude with the 1st Defendants, it should be very easy for him
                        to answer my questions and allegations.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Plaintiff repeatedly made similar
                    arguments during oral submissions. I explained to her that she may have
                    misconstrued the purpose of affidavits in Court proceedings, and that affidavits
                    are a means for parties to bring evidence to the Court’s attention. I also
                    explained to the Plaintiff that legal arguments need not be reduced to affidavit
                    form, and that such arguments are brought to the Court’s attention through
                    written and oral submissions. It appears that the Plaintiff nevertheless
                    maintains her argument that the Defendants have no defence because of their
                    alleged refusal to reduce arguments into affidavit form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I find that the Plaintiff’s argument
                    that the Defendants have no defence to her claim is entirely misconceived. It is
                    premised on the Plaintiff’s failure to understand the relationship between
                    pleadings, affidavits and submissions. While I have taken account the
                    Plaintiff’s oft-repeated rejoinder that she is acting in person and is a
                    layperson, that does not bestow credibility to her entirely misconceived
                    argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     For the above reasons, I dismiss the
                    Plaintiff’s application to strike out the Defendants’ defences and
                    counterclaim in SUM 5561 of 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In summary, I have struck out the
                    Plaintiff’s claims against both Defendants. I have found that the OPQ does
                    not have contractual effect and is not enforceable against the 1st Defendant. I
                    have also found that the OPQ’s terms are not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I have determined the natural and ordinary
                    meaning of the pleaded statements taken from the Plaintiff’s Blog, and
                    have found such statements to be defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I have dismissed the Plaintiff’s
                    application to strike out both Defendants’ defences, and to strike out the
                    1st Defendant’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I will hear parties on costs.</p>
