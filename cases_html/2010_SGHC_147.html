        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, the Government of the Republic of
                    China (Taiwan), instituted the present proceedings to recover US$29.8m that it
                    paid into a bank account in Singapore that was jointly operated by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Mr Ching Chi Ju Charles
                    (“Mr Ching”), and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant, Mr Wu Shih-Tsai (“Mr Wu”). The plaintiff
                    asserted that the money in question was to be utilised to fund projects in Papua
                    New Guinea (“PNG”) if the latter established full diplomatic
                    relations with Taiwan. However, when the plaintiff asked the defendants to
                    return the US$29.8m after it became clear that diplomatic relations with PNG
                    would not be established, the defendants did not return the said sum to the
                    plaintiff. Hence, the plaintiff instituted the present proceedings against the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As judgment was entered on 17 October 2008
                    against Mr Wu, who did not enter an appearance in these proceedings, the
                    trial was only concerned with the plaintiff’s claim against Mr Ching,
                    who contended that he did not have to return any money to the plaintiff because
                    Mr Wu had withdrawn a little less than a third of the money in the account
                    and the rest of the money in the account was intended to pay him for his
                    services to Taiwan as a secret emissary to China and as an intermediary between
                    the plaintiff and PNG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 1996, the plaintiff attempted to but failed
                    to establish diplomatic relations with PNG. In mid-2006, the plaintiff sought
                    once again to establish full diplomatic relations with PNG (the “PNG
                    project”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the plaintiff, its usual practice
                    when trying to establish diplomatic relations with a country is to negotiate
                    through intermediaries. It was not disputed that the plaintiff appointed
                    Mr Ching and Mr Wu as its intermediaries in its discussions with
                    PNG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 12 August 2006, the following persons
                    attended a meeting (the “12 August 2006 meeting”) with respect to
                    the PNG project at the premises of the plaintiff’s Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs (“MOFA”):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff’s version of events is that
                    at the 12 August 2006 meeting, the PNG representatives requested that US$30m be
                    deposited into a bank account in Singapore in the joint names of Mr Ching
                    and Mr Wu pending the establishment of full diplomatic relations. The
                    plaintiff asserted that it reached an agreement with its intermediaries,
                    Mr Ching and Mr Wu, on the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Ching and Mr Wu would open a joint
                            account with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The plaintiff would transfer US$30m into the OCBC

                            first year following agreement on the terms and contents of its
                            technical assistance plan;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Any withdrawal from the OCBC account would be

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Wu and Mr Ching would return the
                            money in the OCBC account to the plaintiff when the latter requested
                            this.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 14 September 2006, the plaintiff
                    transferred a sum of US$29.8m into this account. The plaintiff explained that
                    the amount transferred to the OCBC account was less than the US$30m promised to
                    PNG because US$200,000 had already been expended on costs relating to
                    negotiations between Taiwanese and PNG officials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 10 October 2006, a delegation from PNG
                    visited Taipei and wanted Mr Huang to sign a joint communiqué on the
                    establishment of diplomatic relations. The proposed joint communiqué was worded
                    as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Huang refused to sign the proposed joint
                    communiqué. He pointed out that although the words “establishment of full
                    diplomatic relations” were used in the heading of the document, there was
                    nothing therein which suggested that such ties were imminent. Instead, the focus
                    of the communiqué was on economic ties between Taiwan and PNG. Mr Huang
                    added that the fact that PNG’s then foreign minister, Sir Michael Somare
                    (“Sir Michael”), who was also PNG’s prime minister at the
                    material time, was not a part of the PNG delegation led him to doubt whether PNG
                    had any intention to establish full diplomatic relations with
                Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 13 October 2006, Mr Huang met Sir
                    Michael. He said that as he formed the view that Sir Michael seemed to be
                    interested in receiving economic aid from Taiwan and not in the establishment of
                    diplomatic ties, he decided to stop the PNG project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendants were then asked to return the
                    money in the OCBC account to the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff, in
                    mid-October 2006, Mr Chang met Mr Ching, who told him that as the
                    discussions on the PNG mission had not been completed, it was not time to return
                    the money in the OCBC account to the plaintiff. Mr Chang said that when he
                    reported Mr Ching’s response to Mr Huang, he was told that the
                    PNG project had been abandoned and that Mr Ching should return the money.
                    Mr Chang said that he met Mr Ching again in Taipei on 24 December
                    2006 to discuss the money in the OCBC account and that the latter replied that
                    he would arrange for the return of the said money to the plaintiff after he had
                    visited his daughter in China. Mr Chang said that after Mr Ching did
                    not return the money, he went to Los Angeles seven times to meet Mr Ching
                    but he failed to meet the latter. Mr Ching admitted that he met
                    Mr Chang on 24 December 2006 but he claimed that it was merely a
                    social occasion that had nothing to do with the OCBC account. Remarkably, he did
                    not shed much light on why he could not be contacted by the plaintiffs for such
                    a long period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 18 April 2008, the plaintiff commenced
                    the present proceedings against the defendants. On 25 April 2008, the High
                    Court issued a Mareva injunction to prevent the defendants from disposing of
                    their assets in Singapore up to the value of US$29.8m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Mr Ching is entitled to any part of the money in the
                OCBC Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was common ground that the plaintiff paid
                    US$29.8m into the OCBC account. In his AEIC, Mr Ching stated as follows at
                    [7(c)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On September 14, 2006, the Taiwan Foreign Ministry used a front
                        company and wired US$29.8 million to a bank account in Singapore in the
                        joint names of Wu and me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Mr Huang, who was the plaintiff’s
                    foreign minister between January 2006 to May 2008, said that the plaintiff had
                    transferred US$29.8m to the OCBC account for the sole purpose of establishing
                    diplomatic ties with PNG and that as the attempt to establish the said ties
                    failed, the money should be returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In contrast, Mr Ching contended the
                    plaintiff had put US$29.8m into the OCBC account for a number of purposes. To
                    begin with, he claimed that US$10m in the OCBC account was intended to reward
                    him for his work as Taiwan’s secret emissary for the improvement of
                    relations with China. As for the remaining US$19.8m in the OCBC account,
                    Mr Ching pleaded in his Defence at [3c] that, upon obtaining PNG’s
                    agreement to establish an “official government-to-government
                    relationship” with the plaintiff, Mr Wu was to receive “such
                    of the US$19.8m that was spent in his efforts” while the rest of the
                    money was to be given to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Whether the plaintiff can recover the money in
                    the OCBC account thus depends on why the plaintiff transferred the US$29.8m to
                    the OCBC account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether US$10m was for Mr Ching’s role as secret
                emissary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Ching’s contention that US$10
                    million in the OCBC account belonged to him as it was intended to pay him for
                    work done by him from 1995 to 2000 as Taiwan’s secret emissary to China
                    will first be considered. He explained his role as Taiwan’s secret
                    emissary to China in his AEIC at [5(a) to 5(b)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Commencing in or about 1995, I was asked by Mr Liu Tai-Ying (a high
                        level confidante of Taiwan’s then President, Lee Teng-Hui) to serve as
                        the President’s secret go-between with high officials of PRC and to
                        avoid any misunderstandings that might increase tensions. I reported
                        directly to Mr Liu until 2000. In 2000, a new President was elected
                        – Mr Chen Shui-Bien …. I was asked by [Chiou I-Jen] (who
                        was a personal confidante of the new president, and then assumed the post of
                        the Secretary-General of the President’s Office) and [Ker Chen-Keng]
                        to continue my work as a secret emissary of the new president of
                        Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason for my being a <em>secret</em> emissary
                        was because, until recently, the political atmosphere in Taiwan vis-à-vis
                        the PRC was highly charged and extremely sensitive, and should it be known
                        that if any government official had been in contact with officials of the
                        PRC, it would be politically unacceptable and the end of that
                        official’s career. Another reason was that, recognizing the need for
                        secrecy, I was specially affirmed by PRC’s President and General
                        Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr Hu Jintao, as the
                            <em>sole</em> “window” to Taiwan in
                        order to minimize the sources of new leaks. I was told this by Mr Zhang
                        Huei, … then the Vice Director of the Chinese Communist Party Central
                        Committee’s Taiwan Work Office ….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Ching even claimed in his AEIC at
                    [5(p)] that it was “not immodest” for him to say that “much
                    conflict, perhaps even rising to the level of a military confrontation between
                    Taiwan and China” had been averted because of his role as Taiwan’s
                    secret emissary to China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The problem with Mr Ching’s case is
                    that he furnished no credible evidence to prove that he was Taiwan’s
                    secret emissary or that China’s President Hu Jintao regarded him as the
                    “sole window to Taiwan”. Furthermore, regardless of whether he was
                    a secret emissary to China, he did not prove that any part of the money
                    transferred by the plaintiff to the OCBC account was intended to pay him for his
                    role as an emissary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff submitted that
                    Mr Ching’s defence, which made numerous references to past and
                    present political figures in Taiwan and China, is sensational and inconsistent
                    with his surreptitious conduct in avoiding its officers since December 2006. It
                    pointed out that even its foreign minister at the material time, Mr Huang,
                    is unaware of Mr Ching’s alleged role as Taiwan’s secret
                    emissary to China. When cross-examined as to whether he had any evidence that
                    President Hu Jintao regarded him as the “sole window” to Taiwan,
                    Mr Ching said that this information had been passed to him by a Chinese
                    official, Mr Zhang Huei. When questioned further, he rambled on without
                    focusing on the question before he finally conceded that he had no evidence. The
                    relevant part of the proceedings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> is as follows:</p>

                    was no other evidence that suggested that the documents in question are indeed
                    the notes of Mr Ching’s meetings with top Chinese and Taiwan

                    that Mr Ching was Taiwan’s secret agent, it is noteworthy that

                    him that he was entitled to keep US$10m for his role as secret agent for Taiwan
                    did not advance his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Until January 2010, Mr Ching’s
                    position, as stated in his first AEIC filed on 18 November 2009, was that
                    Mr Chang and Mr Lee had informed him that US$10m in the OCBC account
                    was to, in his own words, compensate him for “the past ten years of
                    toiling as the Taiwan president’s secret emissary” to China. He
                    stated as follows in that AEIC at [7(c)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On September 14, 2006, the Taiwan Foreign ministry used a front
                        company and wired US$29.8 million to a bank account in Singapore in the
                        joint names and me …. <em>CHANG and LEE told me that

                            gratitude, and this PNG project came along and they used it as a way to
                            get the $10 million to me under its cover</em>. Even though I
                        humbly demurred, saying I would have done all that and more for my home
                        country, CHANG insisted, and said “what had already gone out must not
                        be returned.” I therefore accepted the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Chang testified that he was not even
                    aware of Mr Ching’s role as a secret emissary. In his AEIC at [13],
                    Mr Chang stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I understand that in this legal action, Mr Ching claims that out of
                        the said sum of money, US$10 million was intended as reward or compensation

                    of the US$30m was intended for Mr Ching’s alleged role as a secret
                    emissary. He stated in his AEIC at [8] as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The fresh revelations by Mr Ching in his
                    supplementary AEIC are rather surprising. During the trial, his counsel,
                    Mr Lawrence Lee, sought to portray Mr Chiou as a very powerful man
                    with authority to pay Mr Ching US$10m for his work as a secret emissary. If
                    this was indeed the case, Mr Ching, who had referred to his dealings with
                    Mr Chiou and Mr Ker in his first AEIC, ought to have stated in that
                    AEIC that it was Mr Chiou who had agreed to pay him US$10m for “the
                    many things” that he did for the country. Instead, in that AEIC,
                    Mr Ching had merely mentioned that Mr Chang and Mr Lee, whom he
                    described as “underlings at the Foreign Ministry”, had told him to
                    keep US$10m for himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Ching admitted that he had no written
                    evidence and no witnesses to prove that Mr Chiou had authorized the
                    diversion of US$10m, which was ostensibly intended for the PNG project, to
                    Mr Ching’s own pocket. In the absence of proper evidence, the court
                    cannot find that Mr Chiou, who is not in court to defend himself, had
                    authorized the said diversion of government funds to
                Mr Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     After taking all the circumstances into
                    account, I hold that Mr Ching failed to prove that he is entitled to keep
                    US$10m out of the US$29.8m in the OCBC account as a reward for his work as a
                    secret emissary to China.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The remaining US$19.8m</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for the remaining US$19.8m in the OCBC
                    account, Mr Ching asserted that there is nothing left in the said account
                    to refund to the plaintiff because Mr Wu had spent US$8m to US$9m in
                    furtherance of the project entrusted to him and the balance of the money was
                    intended to compensate him for his work as an intermediary between Taiwan and
                    PNG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr Ching did not furnish a consistent
                    account of what the US$19.8m was intended for. In his AEIC, Mr Ching stated
                    at [7c] that only US$9.8m was intended for payments to PNG’s
                    representatives while US$10m was intended to compensate him and Mr Wu for
                    their work as intermediaries in the PNG matter. However, according to his
                    Defence (Amendment No 3), Mr Ching claimed that it was agreed between him
                    and Mr Wu as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Wu was to receive such of the US$19.8m
                            that he spent on the PNG matter; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the balance of the money in the OCBC account
                            would be disbursed to him.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There is no evidence before the court that
                    Mr Wu had spent any money in furtherance of the project entrusted to him.
                    When re-examined by his own counsel, Mr Lawrence Lee, Mr Ching claimed
                    that his lawyers had compiled a list to show the movement of money from the OCBC
                    account but the alleged list was not produced in court. I thus find that it was
                    not proven that Mr Wu had legitimately spent the amount in question in
                    furtherance of the plaintiff’s aim to establish diplomatic ties with PNG
                    or that any money in the OCBC account had been transferred to Mr Wu’s
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I now turn to Mr Ching’s assertions
                    that the task undertaken by him was to enhance the bilateral relationship
                    between Taiwan and PNG and not to assist in establishing full diplomatic ties
                    between Taiwan and PNG and that he had earned around US$10m by fulfilling his
                    task. He stated in his AEIC at [9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">9(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Taiwan could not have realistically harboured the
                            hope that, this time, in 2006, it could “buy” PNG’s
                            diplomatic recognition for the relatively measly sum of only US$30
                            million. Instead, the assignment was just to enhance the two
                            countries’ relationship. In fact, Plaintiff’s Statement of
                            Claim says this much, the defendants were engaged “to enhance the
                            bilateral relationships between the Plaintiff and
                        PNG”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The defendants herein <em>did</em> accomplish what they were engaged to do, and vastly
                            improved the bilateral relationship between PNG and Taiwan. PNG
                            established an official trade office in Taipei, PNG appointed an
                            official representative in Taiwan, it issued a joint communiqué
                            proclaiming their improved cultural and trade relationship, and
                            high-level ministers had frequent official visits to each other‘s
                            capital, etc. This was a far cry from 1999 when the relationship was in
                            the pits, and they were not even talking to each other.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The court is in no position to determine
                    whether the sum of US$30m is a realistic amount to persuade PNG to establish
                    diplomatic ties with the plaintiff. What needs to be noted is that
                    Mr Ching’s assertion that his task was merely to enhance bilateral
                    relations between Taiwan and PNG contradicts his own pleadings. For instance, in
                    his Defence (Amendment No 3), he pleaded at [3b] that US$19.8m was to
                    establish “an official <em>government-to-government
                        relationship</em> between PNG and the Plaintiff and for the
                    Defendants’ remuneration in acting as intermediaries” (emphasis
                    added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Whether Mr Ching’s task was, as he
                    claimed, to help the plaintiff establish official government-to-government
                    relationship with PNG, or, as the plaintiff contends, to assist in the
                    establishing of full diplomatic ties with PNG, I accept the plaintiff’s
                    evidence that the US$29.8m in the OCBC account was part of the US$30m intended
                    to fund projects in PNG after full diplomatic ties had been established with PNG
                    and that no part of the money was intended to compensate either Mr Ching or
                    Mr Wu. Mr Huang’s evidence on this point was corroborated by
                    Mr Chang and Mr Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the US$29.8m</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     My findings thus far may be summarized as
                    follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Ching agreed to assist the plaintiff in
                            the PNG project;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Ching had agreed with the plaintiff that
                            the OCBC account would be opened for the purpose of receiving from the
                            latter the sum of US$29.8m, which was solely intended for the purpose of
                            the PNG project;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Ching failed to prove that the money in
                            the OCBC account was intended to pay him for his services as a secret
                            emissary to China and as an intermediary in the PNG
                        project;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Ching failed to prove that Mr Wu had
                            legitimately spent any money in the OCBC account on the PNG project;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The PNG project was called off by the plaintiff
                            after it concluded that full diplomatic ties would not be established
                            with PNG.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the light of my findings, the plaintiff is
                    entitled to the US$29.8m that it deposited into the OCBC account. This right
                    rests on principles of agency law. The plaintiff appointed Mr Ching and
                    Mr Wu as its intermediaries for the PNG project. Mr Ching did not deny
                    that he was the plaintiff’s intermediary for the said project. What he
                    contended was that he was entitled to be paid for his services. As I have found
                    that he had agreed to act as an intermediary without any payment for his
                    services, he was a gratuitous agent. In regard to the recovery by a principal of
                    money handed over by him to his agent, <em>Bowstead and Reynolds
                        on Agency</em>, 18<sup>th</sup> ed, Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 2006, explained the position at para 6-097 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">
<b>Article 51</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">COMMON LAW DUTY TO PAY OVER MONEY HELD FOR
                            PRINCIPAL</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A]n agent who holds or receives money for his principal is bound
                                to pay over or account for that money at the request of his
                                principal, notwithstanding claims by third parties, even if the
                                money has been received in respect of a void or illegal
                                transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, when the plaintiff called
                    off the PNG project and asked for the return of the US$29.8m, Mr Ching was
                    obliged as a gratuitous agent to return the money. I thus hold that the
                    plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the sum of US$29.8m. The plaintiff is also
                    entitled to the interest that has accrued in the OCBC account or would have
                    accrued had the entire sum of US$29.8m remained in the said account until the
                    date of judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff is entitled to
                costs.</p>
