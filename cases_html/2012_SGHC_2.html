<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, China Taiping Insurance
                    (Singapore) Pte. Ltd (formerly known as China Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd)
                    (“the Plaintiff”) has eight heads of claims against the defendant,
                    Mr Teoh Cheng Leong (“the Defendant”) based on two main sets
                    of documents, <em>viz</em>, (a) 47 guarantees (referred to
                    collectively as “the Guarantees”) provided by the Plaintiff to the
                    Controller of Immigration (“the Controller”) at the request of the
                    respective Companies (as defined in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) and,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the Defendant; and (b) 47
                    documents entitled “Indemnities” (referred to collectively as
                    “the Indemnities”) which were executed concurrently with the
                    Guarantees by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff’s claim totalled up to
                    $449,896.98 and comprised of eight heads of claims as follows: (i) token wages
                    ($350,423.33), (ii) bond ($500), (iii) air tickets ($41,330), (iv)meals
                    ($292.50), (v) lodging ($29,641.65), (vi) mattress ($399), (vii) transport
                    ($10.50) and (viii) administrative fees ($27,300). Counsel for the Defendant
                    confirmed twice during the trial that the Defendant does not dispute the claims
                    for (ii) the bond, (iii) air tickets, (iv) meals, (v) lodging and (vi)
                        mattress<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The core of the dispute therefore
                    centred on whether the Plaintiff was justified in claiming for (i) token wages,
                    (vii) transport and (viii) administrative fees based on the Guarantees and the
                    Indemnities. The determination of the exact legal nature of the Guarantees and
                    the Indemnities will therefore be determinative of this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On close examination of both the Guarantees and
                    the Indemnities, I found that all eight heads of the Plaintiff’s claim as
                    stated in <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> were proved. As the issues of
                    liability and damages were bifurcated by an order of court dated 20 May
                    2011, I gave interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff with damages to be
                    assessed by the Registrar with costs reserved to the Registrar hearing the
                    assessment. I now give the grounds of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The factual background is undisputed. The
                    Defendant was the director of six companies in the SME group of companies
                    (“SME Group”), <em>viz</em>, (a) SME Group
                    Pte Ltd, (b) RE &amp; RI Logistics Pte Ltd , (c) SME Dorm Pte Ltd, (d) SME
                    Logistics Pte Ltd, (e) RE &amp; RI Cleaning Services Pte Ltd and (f) SME
                    Consultancy Pte Ltd (collectively referred to as “the
                        Companies”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The key person of the SME Group
                    was the Defendant’s father-in-law, Mr Lim Chye Cheng, but he was not
                    involved in the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Companies employed, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, 182 foreign workers as work permit holders. Pursuant to
                    Regulation 21 of the Immigration Regulations (Cap 133, Regulation 1,
                    1998 Rev Ed), the Companies were required to provide security bonds for
                    these foreign workers in the form titled “Security Bond Form for Foreign
                    Workers” marked “WPCM 013” (“the Security
                        Bonds”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. The Security Bonds
                    required the Companies, as the employers of the 182 foreign workers, to place a
                    security deposit of $5,000 per foreign worker (a) to secure the foreign
                    workers’ compliance with the conditions of the Security Bond; and (b) to
                    ensure observance of further conditions imposed on the employers in the Security
                    Bond. The total security deposit for all 182 foreign workers would amount to
                    $910,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Instead of placing a cash security deposit of
                    $910,000 with the Controller, the Defendant had, as stated in the Indemnities,
                    requested the Plaintiff to provide Guarantees to the Controller whereby under
                    Clause 1 of the Guarantees, the Plaintiff was to “guarantee and undertake
                    as principal debtors to pay to [the Controller] at any time forthwith, on
                        demand”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> the security deposit originally required
                    under the Security Bond. Thus, the Companies’ requirement to furnish a
                    security deposit of $910,000 with the Controller under the Security Bond was
                    dispensed with because of the Plaintiff’s Guarantees to the Controller.
                    The Guarantees dated between 28 November 2007 and 19 December 2008
                    were for various sums ranging from $5,000 to $85,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In consideration of the Plaintiff’s
                    Guarantees, the Defendant executed concurrently (<em>ie</em>, on the same day) the Indemnities<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and severally, agree and
                        undertake to indemnify [the Plaintiff] and keep [the Plaintiff] fully and
                        completely indemnified against all claims, payments, demands, actions,
                        suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses whatsoever and
                        however which may be taken or made against [the Plaintiff] or incurred or
                        become payable by [the Plaintiff] in any way arising from or in connection
                        with [the Plaintiff’s] issue of the Bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Indemnities were similarly dated between 28 November 2007 and
                    19 December 2008. It is noted that these Indemnities (and the corresponding
                    Guarantees) have identical terms setting out their obligations and differ only
                    as to the quantum of the security deposits and the companies
                involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       During the period between February 2009 and June
                    2009, the Companies requested the Plaintiff’s assistance to repatriate the
                    182 workers to prevent the forfeiture of the entire security deposit under the
                    Security Bonds by the Controller. The Companies had breached the conditions of
                    the Security Bonds by failing in the upkeep and maintenance of the 182 foreign
                    workers (<em>ie</em>, by failing to provide lodging and
                    meals to these foreign workers), and by failing to repatriate them. Although it
                    was the Controller who was named in the Guarantees, parties agreed that it was
                    the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) who was entitled to have the
                    entire $910,000 security deposit for the 182 foreign workers forfeited. However,
                    instead of an automatic forfeiture of the whole sum, the Plaintiff was called
                    upon by MOM to assist in resolving the problems of housing, meals, transport and
                    unpaid wages for the 182 workers and in their repatriation. In order to mitigate
                    the loss, the Plaintiff agreed to cooperate with MOM to avoid the forfeiture of
                    the entire $910,000 in security deposits. The Defendant admitted that he knew
                    that the Plaintiff was carrying out direct negotiations with MOM<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. He
                    had attended one meeting with the Plaintiff and MOM where he was informed
                    “of the steps that the Plaintiff would be taking, pursuant to [its]
                    discussions with MOM”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.
                    The Defendant admitted that he did help ascertain the “token
                    wages” even if he disputed whether the “token wages”
                    reflected the true amount of unpaid wages of the workers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. He stated
                    that he helped the Plaintiff because in doing so, he would also be helping
                    himself by reducing the amount of the claims<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. The Defendant also signed on
                    some of the payment records of the foreign workers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There was an agreement between MOM and the
                    Plaintiff set out as follows in an email from Jeanette Har of MOM to the
                    Plaintiff dated 28 February 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This mail is to follow up with our discussions and your companies’
                        agreement to pay up to a maximum of $3,000 (inclusive of air-ticket) per
                        worker for the <em>insurance guarantees</em> issued by
                        your companies in respect of foreign workers hired by 14 companies. We have
                        given the detailed listing to China Insurance, and we will be doing so
                        shortly for India Insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2 During the MOM’s discussion with you, we have told you that the
                        eventual amount paid to the workers will comprise the following
                        components:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    salary arrears and overtime, and other statutory
                            claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  return of $500 of security deposit</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  an ex-gratia component (those to be
                            repatriated)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv)  air-ticket (those to be
                        repatriated)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You have also agreed that should there be incidental cost in respect of
                        the maintenance of workers from now to their repatriation or their
                        successful change of employment, your companies would be prepared to chip in
                        to help.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, pursuant to the agreement with MOM, the Plaintiff incurred
                    a total cost of $449,896.98 through the eight heads of claims as set out in
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> which it now claims should be repaid
                    by the Defendant under the Indemnities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Three witnesses gave evidence at trial,
                        <em>viz</em>, (i) Mr Foo Jong Meng, the Deputy
                    Director of Labour Relations of the MOM (“Foo”); (ii) Ms Lee
                    Ah Teng Josephine, the Claims Manager for the Plaintiff (“Lee”),
                    giving evidence for the Plaintiff; and (iii) the Defendant giving evidence for
                    himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The main premise of the Plaintiff’s
                    submission was that the Guarantees were “on-demand guarantees, <em>ie</em>. payable upon demand without requirement of proof of
                    any default on the part of the Companies or linkage to the Security
                        Bond”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. MOM was
                    therefore entitled to call upon the Security Bonds and have the Plaintiff
                    disburse the $910,000 security deposit even without a default of the Security
                    Bonds. The obligations under the Security Bonds were irrelevant to the
                    liabilities of the Plaintiff and the Defendant under the Guarantees and
                    Indemnities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the present case of a clear default of the
                    Security Bonds, MOM had informed the Plaintiff that it would call upon the
                    Security Bonds if the Plaintiff did not assist and pay for unpaid salaries,
                    housing, meals, transportation, air tickets and mattresses. Therefore, the
                    Plaintiff made the payments and incurred expenses as stated above in <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> in good faith pursuant to an agreement with MOM
                    in order to mitigate the full extent of loss under the Guarantee. The Plaintiff
                    had full discretion to compromise any claim or demand which could be taken
                    against the Plaintiff under Clause 2 of the Indemnities (“compromise
                    clause”), which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. [the Plaintiff] may at [the Plaintiff’s] <em>absolute discretion compromise</em> all claims, payments,
                        demands, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, costs and
                        expenses whatsoever and howsoever which may be taken or made against [the

                        order to <em>reduce [the Plaintiff’s] liabilities under
                            the Bond and/or [its/the Plaintiff’s] liabilities to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Furthermore, combined with Clause 1 of the
                    Indemnities which states that “any demands or claims as aforesaid shall
                    as between [the Plaintiff] and [the Defendant] be conclusive evidence that the
                    sum demanded or claimed is (are) properly due and payable”, what the
                    Plaintiff had paid under the Guarantees as stated in <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> represents the full extent of the Defendant’s
                    liabilities to the Plaintiff under the Indemnities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendant’s Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In essence, the Defendant argued that the
                    Plaintiff can only claim those heads of claim that are specifically spelled out
                    under the Security Bonds, <em>ie</em>, bond, air tickets,
                    meals, lodging and mattress. However, token wages, transport and administrative
                    fees are not covered under the conditions of the Security Bonds and therefore
                    cannot be claimed under the Indemnities. This is because the liabilities under
                    the Guarantees and Indemnities are inextricably linked and necessarily
                    circumscribed by the conditions of the Security Bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Legal Issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     There is only one main critical issue in this case – what are the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s obligations <em>vis a vis</em> each other under the Guarantees and Indemnities? The Defendant submits that the liabilities under the Guarantees and Indemnities are circumscribed by the conditions of the Security Bonds, while the Plaintiff submits that the conditions of the Security Bonds are irrelevant. The exact legal nature of the Guarantees and the Indemnities is therefore determinative of this issue. The legal analysis will be as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Main Issue 1: What are the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s
                obligations <em>vis a vis</em> each other under the Guarantees
                and Indemnities? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The parties tended to argue legalistically
                    that because a certain document is an on-demand guarantee, a guarantee or an
                    indemnity, certain obligations will naturally follow such a labelling of the
                    document. This presumes that the titling of the document as a
                    “guarantee” becomes determinative of the nature of obligations
                    within the document itself. However, that is putting the cart before the horse
                    because whether the document is an on-demand guarantee, a guarantee or an
                    indemnity depends on the <em>very nature of the
                        obligations</em> undertaken in the documents themselves. The
                    importance of the contractual construction of the documents to determine their
                    true nature was emphasised by Lord Diplock in <em>Moschi v Lep
                        Air Services Ltd</em> [1973] AC 331 at 346 and 349:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether any particular contractual promise is to be classified as a
                        guarantee so as to attract all or any of the legal consequences to which I
                        have referred <em>depends upon the words in which the parties
                            have expressed the promise. Even the use of the word
                            “guarantee” is not in itself conclusive.</em> It is
                        often used loosely in commercial dealings to mean an ordinary warranty. It
                        is sometimes used to mis-describe what is in law a contract of indemnity and
                        not of guarantee. Where the contractual promise can be correctly classified
                        as a guarantee it is open to the parties expressly to exclude or vary any of
                        their mutual rights or obligations which would otherwise result from its
                        being classified as a guarantee. <em>Every case must depend
                            upon the true construction of the actual words in which the promise is
                            expressed.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1 (a): What are the Plaintiff’s obligations under the
                Guarantees? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Plaintiff’s case is that the
                    Guarantees are on-demand guarantees, also known as demand guarantees, first
                    demand guarantees, performance guarantees or performance bonds (see Low Kee Yang
                    in <em>The Law of Guarantees in Singapore and Malaysia</em>
                    (LexisNexis 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2003) (“<em>The Law of Guarantees in Singapore and Malaysia</em>”) at
                    p 361). The nomenclature of “on-demand guarantees” or
                    “performance guarantees” may be misleading because these
                    undertakings are not in actual substance guarantees as the essential collateral
                    nature of a guarantee is not present. The undertaking in an on-demand guarantee
                    is unconditional and independent. This was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992 (“<em>American Home Assurance”</em>) at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, performance bonds <em>are not guarantees in the
                            true sense</em>, but have been described as a <em>particularly stringent form of contract of indemnity by which a primary
                            liability, wholly independent of any liability which may arise as
                            between the principal and the creditor</em>, falls upon the
                        surety. <em>The fact that the obligation to indemnify is
                            primary and independent has the effect that the principle of
                            co-extensiveness does not apply to contracts of indemnity.</em>
                        Thus an indemnity not only effectively shifts the burden of the
                        principal’s insolvency onto the surety, but also potentially
                        safeguards the creditor against the possibility that his underlying
                        transaction with the principal is void or otherwise unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Edward Owen Engineering
                        Ltd v Barclays Bank International Ltd</em> [1978] QB 159 at
                    166 (“<em>Edward Owen</em>”), an archetype of
                    a performance bond or performance guarantee was stated as follows “[w]e
                    confirm our guarantee…
                    <em>payable on demand without proof or
                    conditions</em>” [emphasis added]. Lord Denning (<em>ibid</em> at 171) compared a performance guarantee to a letter of
                    credit and stressed that the performance guarantee must be paid out <em>according to its terms</em> :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not concerned in the least with the relations between the supplier
                        and the customer; nor with the question whether the supplier has performed
                        his contracted obligation or not; nor with the question whether the supplier
                        is in default or not. The bank must pay according to its guarantee, on
                        demand, if so stipulated, without proof or conditions. The only exception is
                        when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is important also to note the English Court
                    of Appeal judgment in <em>Marubeni Hong Kong and South China Ltd
                        v Mongolian Government</em> [2005] 1 WLR 2497
                        (“<em>Marubeni</em>”), where it was held
                    that in construing a guarantee given outside the context of a banking
                    instrument, the absence of language appropriate to a performance bond or
                    something having similar legal effect created a strong presumption against the
                    parties’ intention to create a performance bond. In <em>Marubeni</em>, the material document was found to be a guarantee
                    instead of a performance bond because the wording of the obligation under the
                    material document was consistent with a secondary obligation and <em>conditional</em> upon default by the buyer. The wording (at
                        <em>Marubeni</em> at [31]-[32]) stated that
                    the obligation only arose if the “amounts payable under the agreement
                    [are] not paid <em>when the same becomes due</em>”
                    [emphasis added] and this is reinforced by the following pledge of “the
                    full and timely performance and observance by the buyer of all the terms and
                    conditions of the agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It was stressed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>American Home Assurance</em> at [49] that the terms
                    of the document need to be construed in light of the parties’ intentions,
                    especially the commercial objectives of the documents executed. As the Court of
                    Appeal stated (<em>ibid</em> at [49]), the clear commercial
                    objective of the performance bond in <em>American Home
                        Assurance</em> was to provide the respondent with “recourse to
                    a ready source of funds” in the event of unsatisfactory or
                    non-performance of the shipyard’s obligations. Therefore what was required
                    was “for a third party to issue performance bonds which would enable the
                    respondent to obtain payment <em>irrespective</em> of the
                    position between them and the shipyard” [emphasis added]. As stated
                    pithily in <em>The Law of Guarantees in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> at p 361 in the context of performance bonds,
                    “[t]he commercial intention is simple enough – to secure a third
                    party payment obligation that is as good as cash”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The terms of the Guarantees provided by the
                    Plaintiff and addressed to the Controller are set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Undoubtedly as stated in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, the commercial purpose of the Guarantees
                    was to provide the Controller or MOM with a third party payment obligation from
                    the Plaintiff that was as good as the cash that would have been held otherwise
                    by the Controller or MOM as the cash security deposit. Each of the Guarantees is
                    in reality an on-demand performance bond that is similar in nature to a
                    promissory note. Clause 1 under the Guarantee makes it clear that the Plaintiff
                    will pay the Controller the cash security deposit contracted for “on
                    demand” without any conditions, and thus the obligation to pay was not
                    contingent on the Companies (or for that matter the Visit Pass Holders) having
                    breached any of the conditions under the Security Bonds. Although the term
                    “guarantee” was used in the Guarantees, it was clear that the
                    Plaintiff was not undertaking to perform only upon the default of the Companies
                    but as a “principal debtor” with a primary liability. There was no
                    need for an actual default by the Companies under the Security Bonds. The only
                    condition was that under Clause 4 where the demand has to be made in
                    “writing” but such a condition is not truly a condition and should
                    be treated only as a procedural matter (see Court of Appeal in <em>Bocotra Construction Pte Ltd and others v
                        Attorney-general</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 262 at [24] (“<em>Bocotra</em>”)). Thus, the obligations under the Guarantees
                    were unconditional on-demand bonds that were in substance similar to the
                    performance bonds in <em>Edward Owen</em> and <em>American Home Assurance.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It should be further noted that with Clause 3
                    as stated in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>, the obligations under the
                    so called Guarantees to MOM are no longer characteristic of what is normally
                    expected of guarantees, where guarantors are usually discharged from their
                    obligations under the guarantee if the obligations of the principal guaranteed
                    by the guarantor are varied or altered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the Defendant’s submissions, he did
                    not address the legal nature of the Guarantees, <em>ie</em>, whether it was only a guarantee or an on-demand guarantee. The
                    Plaintiff noted that the Defendant did not question the meaning and intent of
                    the Guarantees to the Plaintiff. Counsel for the Defendant confirmed during the
                    re-examination of Lee that he did not cross-examine Lee on Clause 1 of the
                    Guarantees at all<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The
                    Defendant’s point simply is that the Guarantees refer to the Security
                    Bonds and therefore are circumscribed by the conditions under the Security
                    Bonds. In <em>Bocotra</em> at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>, the bank was obligated to pay the respondent
                    “forthwith on demand any sums not exceeding in… upon receipt of
                    any written notice”. The Appellants in <em>Bocotra</em>, similar to the Defendant in this case, tried to argue
                    that a separate contract qualified the right of the respondent to pay a demand
                    on the performance bond because the recital in the performance bond made
                        <em>reference</em> to a separate contract as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hereas by cl 9 of the conditions of contract, the contractor must
                        provide a bank guarantee for a sum equal to 10 per cent (10%) of the
                        contract sum, for the due performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Court of Appeal in <em>Bocotra</em> held at [22]
                    that there was no “incorporation” clause in the performance bond
                    and that the:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">logic of the appellants’ submissions is somewhat baffling, as it
                        amounts to asserting that simply because the [performance bond] referred to
                        cl 9, the terms of the entire contract were thereby incorporated
                        “by reference” into the guarantee. We are quite unable to see
                        how the passing reference to cl 9 in the recital could support the
                        appellants’ arguments that the contract itself had qualified the right
                        of the respondent to make a demand on the guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Court of Appeal’s reasoning in
                        <em>Bocotra</em> is equally apposite here. As seen in
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above, while the recital of the
                    Guarantees made references to the conditions under the Security Bonds, these
                    conditions were clearly not incorporated into the operative clauses in the
                    Guarantees to qualify the Controller’s right to make a demand on the
                    Plaintiff. I therefore found that on a construction of the Guarantees, they were
                    on-demand performance bonds and the Plaintiff’s liabilities under the
                    Guarantees were independent and not circumscribed by the conditions in the
                    Security Bonds. The full implications of this will be examined further under
                    Issue 1 (c).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1 (b): What are the Defendant’s obligations under the
                Indemnities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Plaintiff stated that the Indemnities were
                    in substance indemnities and not guarantees as claimed by the Defendant. I noted
                    that when the Defendant was cross-examined about the importance of being a
                    guarantor instead of an indemnifier under the Indemnities, he admitted that he
                    was “not able to tell”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.
                    When used in its widest sense, a contract of indemnity can include a contract of
                    guarantee – however, the distinction between the two is crucial in three
                    main aspects, <em>viz</em>, (i) the guarantor’s
                    liability is co-extensive with the principal but an indemnifier is not affected
                    even if the principal contract is void or unenforceable, (ii) the guarantee must
                    be evidenced in writing (see s 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 (c 3) (UK)
                    and s 6 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) but an
                    indemnity need not be, and (iii) a guarantor will be discharged from liability
                    in certain circumstances that an indemnifier will not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The main difference between a guarantee and
                    indemnity is that the obligation of a guarantor under a guarantee is always
                    subsidiary to the obligation of the principal debtor, who remains primarily
                    liable to the creditor. However, the contract of indemnity is “a contract
                    by one party to keep the other harmless against loss”, which is an
                    obligation of primary liability and is independent of the liability of the
                    principal debtor (see <em>Yeoman Credit Ltd v Latter</em>
                    [1961] 1 WLR 828 at 830-831). The High Court in <em>S Y
                        Technology Inc v Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 756 at [23] cited the
                    English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Argo Caribbean Group Ltd
                        v Lewis</em> [1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 289 for one significant aspect
                    with regards to an indemnity, which is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there are, therefore, three parties to a guarantee, the creditor,
                        the debtor and the guarantor, who promises to answer for “the debt,
                        default or miscarriage of another”, <em>whereas there
                            are only two parties to an indemnity and if it is a promise to indemnify
                            a debtor it is owed to the debtor only, and not because he has failed to
                            perform his obligation, but because he has performed
                        it.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is significant in construing the Indemnities because the
                    Indemnities were clearly only between two parties – the Plaintiff and the
                    Defendant. Although at the portion of the signature in the Indemnities, the
                    Defendant is stated as “Guarantor”, it is clear that the main
                    language of the obligations shows that the Defendant’s liabilities were
                    that of an indemnifier and not a guarantor. The Defendant could not reasonably
                    be construed as a guarantor because there was no principal liability which his
                    liabilities could be ancillary to. The Defendant was not guaranteeing
                    performance of a third party; the Defendant was promising to indemnify the
                    Plaintiff against any payments incurred by the Plaintiff “arising from or
                    in connection with [the Plaintiff’s] issue of the
                Bonds”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Such a primary liability to indemnify is
                    encapsulated in the main obligation of the Defendant towards the Plaintiff,
                    which is stated as follows in the Indemnities, where the Defendant together with
                    some other persons:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and severally, agree and
                        undertake to <em>indemnify [the Plaintiff] and keep [the
                            Plaintiff] fully and completely indemnified against all claims,
                            payments, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities,
                            costs and expenses whatsoever</em> and <em>however</em> which may be taken or made against [the Plaintiff]
                        or <em>incurred or become payable by [the Plaintiff] in any
                            way arising from or in connection with [the Plaintiff’s] issue of
                            the Bonds</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Indemnities were given “in
                    consideration of [the Plaintiff] agreeing at my/our request [<em>ie.</em> the Defendant’s request] and the request of [insert
                    name of one of the Companies] to issue a Security Bond No. …
                    (hereinafter called “the Bond”), in favour of the Controller of
                    Immigration (hereinafter called “the Beneficiary”) for the sums of
                    Singapore…”. Therefore, considering the commercial circumstances,
                    what is stated as “with [the Plaintiff’s] issue of the
                    Bonds” under the Indemnities must be reasonably construed to be the
                    Guarantees that the Plaintiff gave to the Controller in lieu of the cash
                    security deposits required under the Security Bonds. These Guarantees were
                    executed concurrently with the Indemnities and it was common ground between the
                    parties that the Indemnities were executed by the Defendant in consideration of
                    the Plaintiff executing the Guarantees<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.
                    This is as described in Geraldine Andrews &amp; Richard Mille<em>r</em>, <em>Law of Guarantees</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) at p 590 in which as a
                    “condition of giving a performance bond, the bank or surety company will
                    invariably require a <em>counter-indemnity</em> from the
                    person whose performance it secures.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     If that is so, and given the absolute
                    discretion conferred on the Plaintiff to compromise in good faith all claims and
                    demands as encapsulated in the compromise clause (see Clause 2 of the
                    Indemnities at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), the Plaintiff is
                    clearly entitled to be indemnified by the Defendant under the Indemnities
                    against “whatsoever” and “howsoever” amounts that
                    the Plaintiff had paid out to the Controller pursuant to the demands made by the
                    Controller under the Guarantees. The Defendant himself admitted that the
                    Plaintiff had the right to compromise before or after a call on the bond is
                        made<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. He also
                    admitted that the Plaintiff had not done anything which was wrong, unnecessary
                    or inexpedient in their efforts to reduce the total amount that could be called
                    by the Controller.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. I have found no evidence of any bad
                    faith on the part of the Plaintiff when it exercised its discretion to
                    compromise with the Controller and pay out the agreed sums to avoid having the
                    Controller call on the full amounts under the various Guarantees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1 (c): Are the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s
                obligations circumscribed by the Security Bonds? Even if so, will the
                Plaintiff’s claim still succeed under the Guarantees and
                Indemnities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Following the analysis of Issues 1(a) and
                    1(b), the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s obligations under the
                    Guarantees and Indemnities are not circumscribed by the Security Bonds. Whether
                    or not there has been a breach the conditions of the Security Bonds is
                    irrelevant to the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s obligations. As long
                    as there is a demand under the Guarantees, the Plaintiff is obliged to pay
                    whatever amount the Controller or MOM wants the Plaintiff to furnish up to a
                    maximum of $910,000; and under the Indemnities, the Defendant is liable to
                    indemnify the Plaintiff for whatsoever payment has been incurred by the
                    Plaintiff under the Guarantees. The Defendant himself rightly admitted during
                    cross-examination that he is liable to indemnify the Plaintiff even if the
                    Plaintiff exercised its right to compromise what is required to be paid under
                    the Guarantee:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So instead of paying $910,000 if [the Plaintiff]
                            can attempt to lower the sum, that would be acceptable, you have agreed
                            that they can do so?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Even if the Guarantees and Indemnities were
                    indeed circumscribed by the conditions under the Security Bonds, I would still
                    have found for the Plaintiff for all eight heads of its claim. Under the
                    Security Bond, any sum “to the extent of the sum deposited” under
                    the Security Bond can be forfeited in the event that any of the conditions of
                    the Security Bond is breached. The Controller or MOM can thus call for and
                    forfeit any amount it wants up to a maximum of $910,000. This is accepted by the
                    Counsel for the Defendant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: Part of it. They need not call $5,000 [per bond per worker], they

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: That’s the question I posed to him
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: He did say he can call any amount he wants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: He had that liberty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: And then [the Plaintiff] would have no choice but to pay it.</p>

                            whole amount of $449,000 is a part-call on the whole bond, nobody has
                            anything to say. We don’t need the trial here.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: <em>Yes. There’s one
                            practical difficulty.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: What practical difficulty?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: I asked [Foo] earlier, where does the $5,000
                        go to or whatever amount is forfeited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: He can forfeit the whole $5,000 and after that the balance can go
                        to the [consolidated] fund.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: But as far as the insurance company is concerned, it will just have
                        to pay out $449,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: Yes, except according to his evidence, the
                        full sum must go to the consolidated fund, and the only provision that has
                        been made in law, somehow, is for certain sums to be paid out of
                        consolidated fund only for one item, which is airfare. Otherwise you
                        can’t touch that money, it becomes government reserves to be invested

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: <em>Does it make any difference to the liabilities

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: No difference, right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: Yeah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: If MOM calls for the bond for – because MOM can call up to
                        $900,000, MOM call $449,000 – let’s not break the number into
                        how many bonds there were – if you don’t pay, I call $449,000,
                        full stop. Just pay. Nobody is going to say anything. <em>They are entitled to call $449,000 because you did breach the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: You may dispute about the token wage, but effectively you have
                        breached the bond on those items that the bond is very clear about. Who can
                        say anything?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the Defendant]: Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Defendant therefore conceded that if the
                    Controller had called for the forfeiture of the entire security deposit of
                    $910,000 for all 182 workers (based on the security deposit required of $5,000
                    per worker) and the Plaintiff <em>had not compromised</em>
                    but had paid out $910,000 on the Guarantees, the Defendant would nevertheless
                    still be liable to indemnify the Plaintiff for the amount paid out of $910,000.
                    However according to the Defendant, the Plaintiff in exercising its right to
                    compromise, exceeded its powers by paying for token wages, transport and
                    administrative fees that were not spelt out as conditions in the Security Bonds.
                    This reasoning of the Defendant is strange since firstly, the Plaintiff’s
                    right to compromise is at the Plaintiff’s “absolute
                    discretion” in Clause 2 of the Indemnities as long as it is exercised in
                    “good faith” and is “necessary or expedient or
                    desirable”. Secondly, the conditions of the Security Bond itself do not
                    limit the extent of forfeiture in respect of each breach – as long as
                    there is <em>one</em> breach of the conditions of the
                    Security Bond, the Controller is entitled to claim a forfeiture up to the
                        <em>full</em> amount of the security deposit. There is
                    no such restrictive clause in the Guarantees, Indemnities or Security Bonds that
                    the Controller is entitled to demand and Plaintiff is entitled to pay an amount
                    only to the extent of each breach of the conditions. As the Defendant rightfully
                    conceded above, if the Controller had just asked for a part call of $449,000
                    without breaking down its claim, the Defendant cannot even begin an action to
                    ask the Plaintiff to justify what it has paid out under the Guarantees. Quite
                    significantly, the Defendant admitted that part of the Plaintiff’s right
                    to compromise under the Indemnities included “paying for wages if it
                    resulted in [the Defendant] paying less than $910,000”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, and with
                    that, the Defendant had practically admitted the rightfulness of the
                    Plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It was highlighted at trial that the present
                    format (which was not relevant to this case) of the Security Bond required by
                    MOM, which was updated on 1 January 2010, states explicitly that it is a
                    condition of the employer to pay outstanding salaries to the workers before
                        repatriation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. As stated by Foo,
                    MOM’s position for the previous version (relevant to this case) of the
                    Security Bond before the update was that if an employer’s <em>only</em> failing was in not paying the salaries of the
                    workers, this would not be a breach of the Security Bond and would not be
                    sufficient in itself for MOM to call for a forfeiture of the security
                        deposit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. Even if it is accepted that an
                    employer’s obligation to pay the salaries of the foreign workers is not a
                    condition of the Security Bond, this however is not such a hypothetical case. It
                    is common ground that the Defendant did breach the obligations for the
                    “upkeep and maintenance” and
                        “repatriation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> of the 182 foreign workers, which were
                    conditions of the Security Bonds as set out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">i) That during their stay in Singapore, we shall be responsible for their
                            <em>upkeep and maintenance</em> and for <em>the cost of their eventual repatriation</em>, and if any
                        of them should die while in Singapore, for the cost of burial or cremation
                        or the return of the body to the country of nationality;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Therefore, if “token wages” need
                    to come within one of the conditions of the Security Bonds, I would find that
                    the payment of the “token wages” would fall under the “cost
                    of their eventual repatriation”. Foo stated that “[n]o worker
                    would agree to be repatriated if he or she is still owed
                        wages”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Thus payment of the “token
                    wages” is necessary to facilitate the eventual repatriation. Foo
                    testified very clearly that MOM would have forfeited the Security Bonds for the
                    full amount of $5,000 for each foreign worker if the Plaintiff had not agreed to
                    assist in paying the outstanding wages and repatriating the workers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. The
                    Plaintiff’s payments under the heads of “token wages” and
                    “transport” were clearly part of the package deal worked out
                    between the Plaintiff and MOM for the successful repatriation of the foreign
                    workers in order to avoid forfeiting the entire $910,000 under the Security
                    Bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Even if the primary liability of the Defendant
                    to indemnify under the Indemnities is related to the Security Bonds, as espoused
                    in the words “incurred or become payable by [the Plaintiff] in any way
                    arising from or in connection with [the Plaintiff’s] issue of <em>the Bonds</em>” (emphasis added) (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> and <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>
                    above), with the Bonds referring to the conditions of the Security Bonds instead
                    of the Plaintiff’s obligations under the Guarantees, this obligation to
                    indemnify, having regard to the ambit of the phrase “in any way arising
                    from or in connection with”, has been drafted very widely. I would
                    consider all eight heads of the Plaintiff’s claims as payments
                    “arising from or in connection with” the breach of the
                    “upkeep and maintenance” and “repatriation”
                    conditions of the Security Bonds. The head of “administrative
                    fees” clearly arose from the breach of the Security Bonds, being part of
                    the actual expenses the Plaintiff incurred to negotiate with and ensure the
                    successful repatriation of the 182 foreign workers. However, only the items of
                    “administrative fees” that constituted <em>actual</em> administrative expenses incurred should be allowed,
                        <em>eg</em>, actual overtime payments additionally paid
                    to the Plaintiff’s salaried employees to process the repatriation and the
                    various claims on unpaid wages by the 182 work permit holders on an urgent
                    basis, but not “notional administrative expenses” based on the
                    imputed time costs or hourly rates in normally processing the claims for which
                    fixed salaries have to be paid by the Plaintiff to these salaried employees
                    anyway. Even on the Defendant’s case that the Defendant’s obligation
                    to indemnify under the Indemnities is circumscribed by the conditions of the
                    Security Bonds, I would still have allowed the Plaintiff’s
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the Defendant’s evidential point that
                    the Plaintiff failed to prove its case because it failed to prove the relevant
                    Security Bonds, I found that this was irrelevant since the main analysis from
                    Issues 1(a) and 1(b) showed that the Security Bonds were immaterial to the
                    Plaintiff’s case. Also, it must be recognised that the sample of the
                    Security Bond provided in the Plaintiff’s Core Bundle of Documents is a
                    statutorily provided template; there is no suggestion that the relevant Security
                    Bonds differed from the statutory norm. Furthermore, counsel for the Defendant
                    confirmed at the start of the trial that the Defendant was not disputing the
                    authenticity of the documents in the Plaintiff’s Core Bundle, which
                    included a sample of the Security Bond, but reserved the right to cross-examine
                    on the contents of the same<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. Counsel for the Defendant did not object to the
                    use or the relevance of this sample of the Security Bond during the trial, and
                    he even used it as the basis of his cross-examination. The Defendant himself
                    referred to the same sample of the Security Bond in his affidavit and treated
                    the conditions stated therein as being identical to those in the Security Bonds
                    granted by the Companies to the Controller. In fact, MOM’s entitlement to
                    call for any sum up to the maximum of $910,000 of the security deposit under the
                    Security Bonds was accepted by both parties. It was also not disputed between
                    the parties that the Defendant had clearly breached the “upkeeping and
                    maintenance” and “repatriation” conditions of the Security
                    Bonds, which were based on the sample provided. Therefore, even if the
                    conditions of the Security Bonds were material, I would have found that the
                    Plaintiff proved its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The commercial circumstances of an insurer
                    like the Plaintiff giving a performance bond to the Controller in exchange for
                    the dispensation of the Companies’ obligation to provide cash security
                    deposits under the Security Bonds appears to be a relatively common situation in
                    Singapore. The insurer protects itself from any loss that may arise from the
                    issuing of such a performance bond to the Controller by ensuring that the
                    directors of the companies concerned concurrently execute an indemnity to
                    indemnify the insurer against the payments that the insurer will have to pay out
                    in the event the Controller calls on the performance bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Defendant admitted that he understood that
                    as a director of the Companies, he was required to execute the Indemnities to
                    the Plaintiff for the Guarantees for the Security Bonds and that he was
                    “guaranteeing the due performance of these [C]ompanies of their
                    obligations under the Security Bonds”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. He
                    “did not have any issues with this, as the business of the SME Group
                    appeared to [him], to be thriving” and he “therefore signed these
                    [Indemnities], without raising any issues or reservations”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>.
                    The Defendant may have signed the Indemnities under the belief that the
                    management of the SME Group was secure under his father-in-law and therefore
                    there was little risk of him ever having to indemnify the Plaintiff. However,
                    the Defendant cannot escape from the legal consequences of the Indemnities which
                    he had signed and it was clear from the cross-examination that he understood
                    that the obligation he personally undertook was a heavy and wide-ranging one.
                    This is a clear instance of directors of companies needing to be careful of and
                    to comprehend the full extent of their liabilities when they undertake
                    obligations as an indemnifier. This is especially so when the Defendant had
                    taken legal responsibility for the due performance of these Companies when he
                    was not involved with the management of the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Defendant’s proposed interpretation
                    of the relationship between the Guarantees, Indemnities and Security Bonds is
                    not only impractical but one that is inconsistent with the very language and
                    commercial purpose of the documents. The Defendant accepted that if the
                    Plaintiff had not made efforts to reduce the sum forfeited and instantly paid
                    out the $910,000 on the Guarantees, he would be liable to reimburse the
                    $910,000. However, in the event the Plaintiff tries to negotiate and compromise
                    the claim, the Plaintiff can only compromise the claim within the constraints of
                    the conditions specified in the Security Bonds itself. Under such a restrictive
                    interpretation, which is not supported by the documents, an insurer should
                    perhaps avoid attempting to compromise the claim and instead automatically allow
                    forfeiture of the full amount – because the risk of compromising the claim
                    outside its authority falls entirely on the Plaintiff – although it may
                    have acted in good faith to compromise the claim in a way that mutually benefits
                    both the Plaintiff and Defendant. As I found at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> and <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>, the
                    Plaintiff’s right to compromise is an absolute one and even if the right
                    to compromise is qualified by the conditions of the Security Bonds, the
                    Indemnities are drafted widely enough to subsume all eight heads of the
                    Plaintiff’s claim as stated in <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>.
                    Even if I had accepted that the Guarantees and the Indemnities were
                    circumscribed by the conditions of the Security Bonds, I found that the eight
                    heads of claim were “arising from or in connection with” the
                    breach of the “upkeep and maintenance” and
                    “repatriation” conditions of the Security Bonds and the Plaintiff
                    was entitled to be indemnified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I therefore gave interlocutory judgment for
                    the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed by the Registrar with all costs
                    reserved to the Registrar hearing the assessment.</p>
