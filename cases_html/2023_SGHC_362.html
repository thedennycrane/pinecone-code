</div>
</div> The bribery scheme was executed through a conduit company Shi Rong Technology Limited (“Shi Rong”). On 18 September 2018, Shi Rong was engaged to act as a consultant for the purposes of assisting the defendant in bidding for the Subcontract Works. They agreed that, if the defendant was successful in its bid, it would pay Shi Rong a service and consultancy fee amounting to $1,000,000 upon the defendant receiving payment from the claimant for the Subcontract Works. This service and consultancy fee was to be paid in the form of instalments amounting to 5% of each progress payment received by the defendant from the claimant. Mr Niu and Ms Chen had, through Shi Rong, transmitted to the defendant confidential information regarding the details of the Building Works project for the purposes of assisting the defendant in winning the tender for the Subcontract Works. On or about 11 December 2018, after the claimant had awarded the Subcontract Works to the defendant on 30 November 2018, Ms Chen acquired 9,000 shares of Shi Rong and became the full legal owner of Shi Rong. The defendant further entered into an agreement with Shi Rong where the defendant allegedly agreed to purchase from Shi Rong certain items, including what appeared to be construction apparatus (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, an “Overhead Crane Guiderail”), for the price of S$1,950,000. However, it was uncertain whether this construction apparatus had in fact been delivered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The claimant argued that, in return for receiving the bribes, kickbacks, and/or secret profits, Mr Niu and Ms Chen would approve payment claims submitted by the defendant without conducting any proper verification of the work done. This resulted in amounts overclaimed by the defendant (in Payment Claim Nos. 1–15) being certified in full in the claimant’s Payment Response Nos. 1–15. As no payment response was filed in response to PC 16, the claims by the defendant were accepted by the adjudicator in AA 150 almost in full. According to the claimant, this culminated in an over-certification of approximately $3m.

</div> These allegations appeared to have been put forward as an additional ground on which to set aside the ADs and ORC 3729 under s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SOPA. However, at the hearing before me on 11 August 2023, counsel for the claimant, Mr Raymond Wong (“Mr Wong”), informed me that the claimant was no longer advancing the case that the ADs and ORC 3729 should be set aside on the basis that the JEE-Sinohydro Subcontract was allegedly awarded as a result of fraud and/or corruption (by way of kickbacks, bribery and/or secret profits), but without prejudice to its right to advance this case in S 950 and/or in the Arbitration.

</div> In any event, even if Mr Niu and Ms Chen had corruptly and/or fraudulently over-certified the value of the Subcontract Works in PR 14 and PR 15, the defendant contended that this did not materially induce or affect the issuance of the ADs. In both AAs, the learned adjudicators had independently satisfied themselves that the defendant had met the requirements of establishing a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case as regards the orders that it sought.

In my view, this concession was fairly made given what must be the correct position in law. In <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span>, the Court of Appeal held that s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IAA contemplates a situation where the<span class="font-italic"> award itself</span>, rather than the <span class="font-italic">underlying contract</span> between the parties, is tainted or induced by fraud or corruption. As I mentioned at [22], s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SOPA is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IAA. Therefore, similarly, in this application, the claimant could not argue that the ADs should be set aside because the <span class="font-italic">underlying contract</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the JEE-Sinohydro Subcontract, was procured by fraud and/or corruption. The claimant was therefore correct to limit its challenge by relying on the allegation of over-certification of the payment claims as the sole basis for its setting aside application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On a related point, s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IAA is derived from s 36(3) of the Draft New Zealand Arbitration Act (“the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption”): Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <span class="font-italic">Report on Review of Arbitration Laws</span> (August 1993) (Chairman: Giam Chin Toon) at para 23. In <span class="font-italic">Ironsands</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Ltd v Toward Industries Ltd </span>[2012] NZHC 1277 (“<span class="font-italic">Ironsands</span>”), the High Court of New Zealand took judicial notice of the <span class="font-italic">Shorter Oxford Dictionary</span> (Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2002) definition of “corruption” as the “perversion of a person’s integrity in the performance of (esp. official or public) duty or work by bribery etc” (at [59]), concluding at [61] that corruption may be the result of bribery, or of threats, coercion, blackmail or other forms of undue influence. This coheres with the Court of Appeal’s observation in the context of an application to set aside an arbitration award (albeit not specifically in relation to the corruption ground) that corruption includes “illegal conduct, bribery and fraud”: <span class="font-italic">Lao Holdings NV and another v Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic </span>[2023] 1 SLR 55 (“<span class="font-italic">Lao Holdings</span>”) at [74]. In my view, <span class="font-italic">Ironsands</span> and <span class="font-italic">Lao Holdings</span> provide some helpful guidance on at least a working definition of what could constitute “corruption” for the purposes of s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SOPA. It is worth noting that neither case purported to set out an exhaustive definition; nor do I attempt to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Reverting to the application before me, it suffices to say that the allegations raised by the claimant of over-certification of the payment claims in the present case, if established, would amount to both fraudulent and corrupt conduct. To reiterate, the core of the allegation was that the payment claims presented by the defendant to the claimant were over-certified as a result of Mr Niu and Ms Chen receiving bribes, kickbacks, and/or secret profits from the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, at the same time, it cannot be gainsaid that the allegation made by the claimant of fraud and/or corruption in the over-certification of the said payment claims was an intensely factual one, and one which went to the very heart of the merits of the claims being advanced by the claimant: (a) against Mr Niu and Ms Chen <span class="font-italic">in S</span><span class="font-italic"> 950</span>; and (b) against the defendant <span class="font-italic">in the Arbitration</span>. This was not disputed by the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The law is clear that in an application to set aside an adjudication determination, the court does not review the merits of the adjudicator’s determination. That is not within the purview of the supervisory jurisdiction of the court: <span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade Solution Pte Ltd v Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 1125 (“<span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade</span>”) at [36]. In my view, to engage in the merits of the dispute <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span> is antithetical to the scope of the court’s supervisory role under the SOPA. The philosophy underpinning the SOPA lies in the pithy adage “pay now, argue later”: <span class="font-italic">Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd v Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 2 SLR 510 at [48]. To allow parties to litigate the very substance of the underlying merits of the dispute in a SOPA setting aside application would effectively mean bringing forward the “<span class="font-italic">argue later</span>” stage to the stage where the adjudication determination to “<span class="font-italic">pay now</span>” is being reviewed by the court pursuant to its supervisory jurisdiction. If the court were to engage the merits in this way, it would in effect translate to “<span class="font-italic">pay now, argue now and argue again later</span>”. In my view, that would go against the very purpose and philosophy undergirding the SOPA regime. It places the supervisory court in the invidious position of having to engage and decide on the merits of the case solely on the basis of affidavit evidence. In addition, it also subverts the parties’ choice of having the merits of the dispute decided in their agreed forum, such as <span class="font-italic">via</span> arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Therefore, when the court exercises its supervisory role in a SOPA setting aside application, the court should not engage on the merits of the dispute as a whole especially where there is a significant overlap between the ground relied upon in the setting aside application and the merits of the underlying dispute as a whole. Applying this principle to the present case, given that the allegation of fraud and/or corruption in the over-certification of payment claims is at the heart of and the very subject of the substantive dispute, which is to be resolved in S 950 or the Arbitration, I was of the view that the court should not enter the arena and engage in the disputed merits of the case in this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, I would caveat my comments and observations above. It is also clear from <span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade</span> at [35] that an adjudication determination will not be set aside because of mere allegations of fraud There must be compelling evidence of fraud before the court. In my view, that must also be the case when allegations of corruption are raised. If the evidence of fraud and/or corruption is so compelling that there is effectively <span class="font-italic">no dispute</span> on the merits to be had, then the supervisory court in finding that the making of an adjudication determination was induced by fraud and/or corruption would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be intruding into the territory of a dispute on the merits, or reviewing the merits of the adjudicator’s determination. There is, in the scenario above, effectively no dispute on the merits to begin with and therefore the court would not be subverting the SOPA regime. Thus, in a case where just on the affidavit evidence alone, the high threshold of compelling evidence of fraud and/or corruption inducing or affecting the adjudication determination is met, then the adjudication determination may be set aside (<span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade </span>at [35]). For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade</span> itself, the evidence was “incontrovertible” that the appellant had fraudulently represented that it had control over all the undelivered window panels and could have performed the contract. There was also indisputable evidence that the appellant did not in fact have control over all the undelivered window panels (at [39], [40], [43] and [44]). As such, <span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade </span>may be explained as an instance where the evidence of fraud was so strong and compelling that there was effectively no dispute on the merits of the case to be had.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In contrast, in the present case, the allegations of fraud and/or corruption in the alleged over-certification of the defendant’s payment claims levelled by the claimant against the defendant were hotly contested and, as I mentioned above, was an intensely factual dispute on the merits. The affidavit evidence on the allegations of over-certification was by no means incontrovertible. In these circumstances, I could not legitimately engage the merits of the claimant’s case, for the reasons explained above at [32]–[33] above. Further, and for the following reasons, I found that <span class="font-italic">on the evidence before me</span>, the claimant had not in any event established a compelling case of fraud and/or corruption that had induced or affected the making of the ADs such as to justify setting aside the ADs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 First, the claimant relied on the absence of any defects noted in the first 15 payment claims as one of the <span class="font-italic">indicia</span> of corruption.

The absence of any evidence of the claimant taking action against the entities/persons who, on the face of the documents, were directly responsible and involved in the certification process also diluted the strength of the evidence as to the existence of the alleged fraudulent and/or corrupt scheme, at least for the purposes of meeting the requisite threshold <span class="font-italic">in this application</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Third, the claimant relied on the fact that the defendant’s certification of the work done by the defendant’s sub-contractor Vico, in terms of the percentage of work done, were in some instances lower than what the defendant itself claimed from the claimant up the chain.

They were raised at the hearing before me and I did not have the complete picture of the numbers or the parties’ respective versions of what the amounts should be. In any event, I could not arrive at any conclusions on either side’s contentions. These were, chiefly, matters to be thrashed out in S 950 or the Arbitration. Furthermore, the point remained that there could well be innocent explanations for the alleged discrepancies highlighted by the claimant, which would need to be tested in a final hearing in the appropriate forum. Therefore, these so-called “discrepancies”, in and of themselves, did not amount to compelling evidence of fraud and/or corruption justifying the setting aside of the ADs. In this regard, I agreed with Mr See that at the end of the day, the allegations levelled by the claimant against the defendant and the defendant’s explanations would be more appropriately explored, tested, argued and resolved in the proper forum, be it S 950 or the Arbitration (as the case may be) – the latter being the forum where the “ground-clearing” has been ordered to take place pursuant to my judgment in S 950 affirming the AR’s decision to grant a case management stay (see [17] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Fourth, the claimant relied on a report of their expert, Mr See Choo Lip (the “Expert”), to support its case on over-certification.

</div> The claimant argued that the Expert’s analysis constituted compelling evidence that the payment claims were most likely issued and certified fraudulently and/or corruptly. In my view, there were a number of problems with that argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Firstly, the mere fact of over-certification (assuming that that was factually the case) was not necessarily compelling evidence that the payment claims must have been issued and/or certified fraudulently and/or corruptly. For one, it did not, for example, explain the precise role(s) of the persons alleged to be involved in the alleged fraudulent and/or corrupt scheme. I focus especially on the role(s) that Mr Niu and/or Ms Chen allegedly played in the certification/approval  process, bearing in mind they are the only natural persons against whom the claimant has commenced proceedings in respect of the alleged over-certification of the payment claims to date, as I noted above at [37].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Secondly, in my view, there were some doubts as to the correctness of the Expert’s method of quantifying the value of the works done. The Expert used the subtractive method for assessment, where he considered the balance of works not done and subtracted it from the contract price, which he derived from a “Schedule of Rates”.

The defendant argued that as such, the proper analysis should require taking the percentage of the work done and multiplying it by the assigned contract value for that particular item of work, rather than making reference to a “Schedule of Rates” which was not even provided for or referred to in the JEE-Sinohydro Subcontract.

</div>
</div> In my judgment, that was an arguable basis for the defendant to challenge the soundness of the Expert’s methodology and the accuracy of his computations. In and of itself, the Expert’s report could not (without more) amount to compelling evidence of fraud and/or corruption in the alleged over-certification of the defendant’s payment claims. Neither was the threshold crossed when the Expert’s report was considered with the rest of the affidavit evidence. Once again, I found that the claimant’s arguments here were, in substance, an invitation for the court to dive into the dispute on its merits, when those merits could only be properly resolved in the appropriate forum (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S 950 or the Arbitration) with the benefit of fuller evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thirdly and more fundamentally, even if the Expert’s report was accepted at face value and the defendant’s computations were entirely disregarded, that report was at best evidence of over-certification. It still left an important question unanswered – at what point did the quantum of over-certification reflect that it was likely to be the result of the alleged fraudulent and/or corrupt scheme coming to fruition? Let me elaborate. If, for example, the over-certification had amounted to $100,000, would that conclusion still support a finding of fraudulent and/or corrupt over-certification by Mr Niu and/or Ms Chen? What if the amount was $1m? No clear answer was given to the court by the claimant on this; indeed, in my view, this was because it was incapable of a clear answer. Viewed in this light, it was difficult to see how the Expert’s <span class="font-italic">numerical </span>conclusions, <span class="font-italic">without more</span>, justified a finding by the court of fraud and/or corruption inducing or affecting the ADs. To arrive at any conclusion on these matters (even a tentative one) would inevitably require the court to delve into the underlying merits of the case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, a further difficulty was that even if the court accepted the Expert’s report as demonstrating fraudulent and/or corrupt over-certification by Mr Niu and/or Ms Chen, the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">best case</span> was that there had been an over-certification by approximately $3m.

</div>
</div> Since the claimant was no longer running a case that the ADs should be set aside because the JEE-Sinohydro Subcontract itself was tainted by corruption (see [22] above), there was really no basis in this case to contend that fraud unravels <span class="font-italic">all</span> and that both ADs should still be set aside <span class="font-italic">in their entirety</span>. There was still, even on the claimant’s best case, approximately $6m of the total sum determined in the ADs to be due to the defendant that was not tainted by any alleged fraudulent and/or corrupt over-certification. In fact, this “untainted” sum amounting to approximately $6m would, even on the claimant’s best case, represent the value of work <span class="font-italic">legitimately</span> carried out by the defendant. I could not imagine it to be just to set aside both ADs in their <span class="font-italic">entirety</span> amounting to approximately $9m simply because (and <span class="font-italic">assuming</span>) there was fraud and/or corruption in the over-certification of the payment claims by some $3m, on the claimant’s best case.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the reasons above, I found that the claimant had not established a cogent case, let alone a compelling one, that the making of the ADs was induced or affected by fraud and/or corruption. I reiterate my view at [31] above that the allegations raised by the claimant in this application, which form the very subject of the substantive dispute in S 950 and the Arbitration, are vigorously contested; those substantive disputes are to be resolved in the appropriate forum and not in this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, I dismissed the claimant’s application to set aside the ADs and ORC 3729. In light of my decision, it was not necessary for me to consider what impact, if any, the facts pertaining to the alleged fraud and/or corruption might have had on the outcome of the ADs (had they been brought to the attention of the adjudicators) or if these were facts and matters that were known to the claimant at the material time and could or ought to have been raised by it during the adjudication proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether to grant a stay of the enforcement of the ADs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380, the Court of Appeal held at [70] that a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination may ordinarily be justified where there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency, or where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent’s favour by a court, a tribunal or some other dispute resolution body.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The claimant did not adduce any evidence or advance any convincing arguments for why either of the recognised grounds for seeking a stay of the enforcement of the ADs was met in this case. Further, the claimant’s allegation of an abuse of process by the defendant relied on the exact same allegations of fraud and/or corruption in the over-certification of the payment claims (see [23] above). As I have already explained above, no compelling evidence was adduced by the claimant of the latter allegations; that alone would be fatal to the claimant’s allegations of abuse of process. In my view, the alternative relief sought by the claimant simply could not get off the ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Finally, I also rejected the claimant’s further alternative oral application for a <span class="font-italic">partial</span> stay of the enforcement of the ADs in the sum of approximately $3m,
