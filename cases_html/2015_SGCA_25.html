<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 12 May 2011, Devendran A/L Supramaniam
                    (“the Appellant”) rode into Singapore on his motorcycle from
                    across the Singapore-Johor Causeway. He was stopped at the Singapore Customs
                    where his motorcycle was searched by customs officers. Six packets of powdery
                    substance were found concealed in the seat of his motorcycle. The substance was
                    established to contain 83.36 grammes of diamorphine. The trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) held that the Appellant failed to rebut the
                    statutory presumption that he knew the nature of the diamorphine. The Judge
                    therefore convicted the Appellant on the charge of importing a controlled drug
                    into Singapore. The Prosecution informed the court that it would not be issuing
                    a certificate of substantive assistance. As mandated under the Misuse of Drugs
                    Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”), the Judge sentenced the
                    Appellant to suffer the punishment of death. The Appellant appeals to this court
                    against both his conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Agreed facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant was about 26 years old at the time
                    of the offence. On the said date, at about 4.45am, the Appellant rode into
                    Singapore from Johor on his motorcycle bearing registration number JMV 4571.
                    When he produced his passport at the Woodlands Checkpoint, he was stopped by the
                    Screening Officer of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
                    (“ICA”). Shortly thereafter, officers from the Central Narcotics
                    Bureau (“CNB”) arrived and searched his motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The physical search and police dog search
                    yielded no results. The Appellant was then asked to push his motorcycle to the
                    ICA detention yard. There, a backscatter scan was conducted. A backscatter scan,
                    based on similar technology behind scanners in airports, is used to detect if
                    anything is concealed in the subject. The scan indicated that foreign objects
                    were concealed in the motorcycle seat. The CNB officers proceeded to dismantle
                    the motorcycle seat and found six bundles of powdery substance wrapped in
                    newspaper concealed therein. The Appellant was placed under arrest for the
                    importation of drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The six bundles were sent to the Health Sciences
                    Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. The gross weight of the substance
                    in the six bundles was 2,728.1 grammes. The substance contained 83.36 grammes of
                    diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant was, accordingly, charged under
                    s 7 of the MDA. The charge reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">YOU ARE CHARGED at the instance of the Public Prosecutor and
                        the charge against you is:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">That you, DEVENDRAN A/L SUPRAMANIAM,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on the 12th day of May 2011 at or about 5.48 a.m, at
                        Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore (“the said place”), while
                        riding a Malaysian registered motorcycle bearing registration no JMV4571,
                        did import into the said place a controlled drug specified in Class A of the
                        First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (“the said
                        Act”), to wit, six (6) packets of granular/powdery substances
                        weighing 2728.1 grams which was analysed and found to contain not less than
                        83.36 grams of diamorphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the
                        Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under
                        section 7 and punishable under section 33 of the said Act, and further upon
                        your conviction under section 7 of the said Act, you may alternatively be
                        liable to be punished under section 33B of the said Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Section 7 of the MDA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Import and export of controlled
                            drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7.</b> Except as authorised by this Act, it
                        shall be an offence for a person to import into or export from Singapore a
                        controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Controlled drugs are defined in the First
                    Schedule to the MDA. Diamorphine is listed as a Class A drug in the First
                    Schedule. The punishment for an offence under s 7 of the MDA is provided
                    for in s 33, which refers to the Second Schedule. According to the Second
                    Schedule, where importation of more than 15 grammes of diamorphine is concerned,
                    the punishment is the death penalty. However, the court has the discretion not
                    to impose the death penalty pursuant to s 33B of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Appellant claimed trial to the charge. He
                    did not contest the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence,
                        <em>ie</em> the physical carrying of the diamorphine
                    from Malaysia into Singapore. He only contested the <em>mens
                        rea</em>. He argued that he did not know that the six bundles
                    concealed in his motorcycle seat contained diamorphine. He did not call any
                    witnesses. His main case was that someone else had planted the drugs in his
                    motorcycle seat. He expounded two theories to substantiate his claim of
                    ignorance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The first is the “Alagendran
                    Theory”. The day before his arrest, on 11 May 2011, around
                    5.00–6.00pm, the Appellant lent his motorcycle to a friend named
                    Alagendran. Alagendran returned the motorcycle to the Appellant at 8.30pm, at
                    which point he informed the latter that at around 6.30pm, he had a fight with
                    someone who was armed with a parang, and that the motorcycle was damaged in the
                    process. There were cuts on the front cover near the handle bar as well as the
                    seat cushion. Because of the damage caused, he took the motorcycle and had it
                    repaired. By the time the Appellant saw the motorcycle at 8.30pm, the repairs
                    had already been done. Based on this theory, the drugs could have been concealed
                    in the seat while Alagendran had the use of the motorcycle, or while the
                    motorcycle was sent by Alagendran for repair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The second is the “Kumar
                    Theory”. On 9 May 2011, the Appellant was informed that his step-brother
                    was arrested in Kedah, Malaysia. Bail of RM2,000 was required to secure his
                    release. The Appellant managed to borrow only RM500 from his friend, Agilan. He
                    then met another friend, Suria, with whom he had previously worked at a shipyard
                    in Pasir Gudang. Suria referred the Appellant to Kumar, who was a fellow
                    colleague at the shipyard in Pasir Gudang. The three met at an eating place in
                    Ulu Tiram, Johor Bahru (“the Shop”). Kumar used his hand phone to
                    call an individual named Gobi and then passed the phone to the Appellant. It
                    bears noting that the Appellant only identified Gobi in his further statement
                    dated 16 May 2011. In his initial statement, he simply referred to his
                    counterpart in that phone conversation as “the person”. Also, the
                    Appellant claimed to have met Gobi twice before, but he was not close to
                        Gobi.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Gobi asked the Appellant for a few details
                    such as whether he had a Singapore passport, and whether he owned any property.
                    The Appellant replied that he owned the motorcycle. Gobi told the Appellant he
                    would lend him RM1,500 if he was willing to pledge the motorcycle as security.
                    The Appellant agreed, and was instructed to meet Kumar the next day, 11 May
                    2011, at 10.00pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 11 May 2011, at around 10.00pm, he rode his
                    motorcycle to the Shop to meet Kumar. There, Kumar told him that Gobi wanted to
                    see the motorcycle to check if it was stolen before granting the loan. Kumar
                    rode away with the motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Two hours later, around midnight, Kumar called
                    the Appellant and informed him that he was back at the Shop. The Appellant went
                    to the Shop to meet him. There, the Appellant took possession of his motorcycle
                    from Kumar who then instructed the Appellant to ride the motorcycle into
                    Singapore around 4.30am the next day (12 May 2011) to meet “Kumar and a
                    Chinese man” at a Caltex petrol kiosk along Kranji Road. He was then to
                    hand his motorcycle to them. His motorcycle would be returned to him at the bus
                    stop near the Caltex petrol kiosk at around noon that same day. The loan would
                    only be given to him that day after he had returned to Johor Bahru. After
                    receiving Kumar’s instructions, the Appellant rode his motorcycle home.
                    When he rode over bumps on the road, he felt the seat was harder than usual.
                    However, he did not check the seat. On this theory, the drugs could have been
                    concealed while the motorcycle was with Kumar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the morning of 12 May 2011, the Appellant
                    rode into Singapore where at Woodlands Checkpoint he was arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge convicted the Appellant and
                    sentenced him to death. The grounds for the Judge’s decision are reported
                    as <em>Public Prosecutor v Devendran A/L Supramaniam</em>
                    [2014] SGHC 140 (“the GD”). His reasons can be stated in brief as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The <em>actus
                            reus</em> of the offence was made out (the GD at
                    [26]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     To establish
                        the <em>mens rea</em> of the offence, the Prosecution
                        relied on the presumptions in ss 18 and 21 of the MDA. The first was
                        that the Appellant was presumed to have been in possession of the
                        diamorphine because it was found in his motorcycle seat, pursuant to either
                            s 18(1)(<em>a</em>) or s 21. The second,
                        following on from the first, was that the Appellant was presumed to have
                        known the nature of the diamorphine by virtue of having the diamorphine in
                        his possession (the GD at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Appellant contested the second presumption. He had to
                        prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge that the
                        bundles contained diamorphine (the GD at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Alagendran Theory was unpersuasive. This is
                        for two reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       First, the story was likely
                            an afterthought. The Appellant only mentioned the events relating to
                            Alagendran on 15 November 2011, around six months after he was arrested.
                            This was despite the fact that the events surrounding Alagendran
                            happened on 11 May 2011, one day before his arrest, and should have been
                            fresh in his mind upon arrest (the GD at
                        [30]–[31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Second, the story itself was incredible. It was
                            unexplained why the motorcycle had to be repaired with such urgency.
                            Furthermore, the Appellant never arranged to meet Alagendran in
                            Singapore, and hence it could not have been the case that Alagendran was
                            making use of the Appellant to transport the drugs. The only other
                            possible explanation, that Alagendran was trying to frame the Appellant,
                            was even more incredible. The Appellant gave no evidence indicating any
                            reason or motive on the part of Alagendran in wanting to set him up. In
                            fact, the Appellant’s evidence pointed at an amicable relationship
                            between them (the GD at [32]–[34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Kumar Theory was similarly
                        unpersuasive. This is for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_e-p3_i"></a>(i)       First, there were
                            significant omissions in the Appellant’s evidence, which caused
                            the Judge to disbelieve the theory. The Appellant did not name either
                            Kumar or Gobi in his cautioned statement, which was recorded on the day
                            of his arrest. He only referred to three different individuals,
                            “a friend of mine”, “another friend”, and
                            “a man”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On hindsight, the
                            first was Agilan, the second was Suria, and the third was likely Kumar.
                            Not only was Kumar not named, Gobi was not even referred to. In his
                            statements on 14 and 15 May 2011, the Appellant referred to “an
                            unknown character”. Only in his statement on 16 May 2011 did he
                            identify this character as Gobi. When he did so, he stated that he knew
                            the person was Gobi because when he spoke to him over the phone, Gobi
                            told the Appellant his name. The Appellant explained that he left Gobi
                            out because he did not want to implicate him in this case. This was
                            despite the fact that the Appellant had first met Gobi only ten days
                            before his arrest although he had known Kumar for four years. Also,
                            after the Appellant gave the contact details of Gobi to the CNB officer,
                            CNB located the user of the phone number and obtained his photograph.
                            The Appellant was asked to identify Gobi from a series of photographs
                            (which included the person who was the owner of that contact number) but
                            was unable to do so (the GD at [35]–[43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_e-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Second, the theory was rife
                            with suspicious circumstances. First, the Appellant simply allowed Kumar
                            to take his motorcycle, worth about RM2,500, for about two hours in the
                            night of 11 May 2011, without any assurance it would have been returned.
                            Second, the Appellant never questioned why he had to ride the motorcycle
                            into Singapore to pass it to Kumar, as opposed to simply allowing Kumar
                            to ride the motorcycle into Singapore. Third, the Appellant did not
                            check the seat of the motorcycle when he felt the unusual hardness upon
                            the motorcycle being returned to him by Kumar. This failure to check was
                            especially suspicious given that the Appellant knew he was going to ride
                            the motorcycle into Singapore, and ought to have ensured that there were
                            no contraband items or drugs hidden therein. The Appellant’s
                            reasons for not checking – that it was late, and he was more
                            concerned about his step-brother – were unpersuasive as a check
                            would not have taken much time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_f"></a>(f)     As neither theory was made out, the Appellant
                        failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_g"></a>(g)     Even if the Kumar Theory were to be
                        true, the Appellant was wilfully blind towards the presence of diamorphine
                        in the motorcycle seat. Such wilful blindness, premised on the
                        Appellant’s failure to check the motorcycle seat despite the
                        suspicious circumstances, was proven beyond reasonable doubt. As wilful
                        blindness equates to actual knowledge, this satisfies the <em>mens rea</em> of the offence (the GD at
                    [50]–[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_h"></a>(h)     The Appellant’s incriminating statements recorded on 15 and 16 May,
                        in which he evinced a desire to plead guilty and stated that he was ready to
                        face death, confirmed his guilt. Neither of these statements was recorded
                        involuntarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After the Judge convicted the Appellant on 14
                    July 2014, the Prosecution informed the court that although it took the view
                    that the Appellant was a drug courier, it would not be issuing the certificate
                    of substantive assistance (“the Certificate”) to the Appellant
                    pursuant to s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA. However,
                    if the Appellant were willing to provide any further information, the
                    Prosecution was prepared to review its position with regard to issuing the
                        Certificate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Appellant requested time to
                    consider the proposal. Further hearing was adjourned to 29 July
                2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 29 July 2014, the Prosecution maintained
                    its position that it was not issuing the Certificate to the Appellant. The Judge
                    accordingly sentenced the Appellant to suffer the punishment of
                death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On appeal, the Appellant was represented by Mr
                    Wendell Wong whose main contention was a reiteration of the case before the
                    Judge, namely, that the Appellant did not know that the packages stuffed in his
                    motorcycle seat contained diamorphine. Much of Mr Wong’s case hinged
                    on the following two points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Judge erred in finding
                        that the Appellant was wilfully blind.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Judge erred in finding that the presumptions
                        were not rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Based on Mr Wong’s own characterisation,
                    he was not running a “positive case” for the Appellant. He was
                    proffering possible counter-theories in a bid to raise a reasonable doubt on the
                    Appellant’s guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Based on the arguments raised before us, we
                    are unable to find that the Judge erred in convicting the Appellant. We will set
                    out the reasons for our holding below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Before engaging the main arguments raised by
                    Mr Wong, we need to address three preliminary issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first two preliminary issues relate to
                    matters of evidence. The third concerns the Appellant’s
                    confessions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Photographs of the motorcycle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first issue concerns the photographs which
                    were tendered in evidence. During oral submissions, there was some confusion as
                    to whether the photographs showed the motorcycle seat before the drugs were
                    removed, or after. It transpired that they were, in fact, photographs of the
                    seat after the drugs were removed. There were no photographs taken of the seat
                    before the removal of the drugs. Such photographs would have greatly assisted
                    both the Judge and this court in a case like this, where much of the
                    disagreement between the parties was as to how peculiar the seat looked (and
                    felt) when the drugs were embedded therein. However, no such photographs were
                    available to assist the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Hardness in the seat </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second issue relates to the exact time at
                    which the Appellant first felt the hardness in the motorcycle seat. As stated
                    above, the Appellant posited two theories to explain how the drugs could have
                    made their way into the seat. If it was Alagendran who placed the drugs into the
                    motorcycle seat, it should follow that the Appellant would have first felt the
                    hardness in the seat after Alagendran returned the motorcycle (at 8.30pm on 11
                    May 2011). If it was Kumar (or Gobi) who placed the drugs into the motorcycle
                    seat, it should follow that the Appellant would only have felt the hardness in
                    the seat after Kumar returned the motorcycle to him (at midnight on 11 May
                    2011).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The first time the Appellant mentioned that he
                    “felt something hard” was in a statement taken on the day soon
                    after he was arrested. The relevant portions read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Statement ended on 12.05.2011 at about 0633hrs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On this statement, it was unclear when exactly he first felt
                        the hardness in the seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In a further statement recorded on 15 May
                    2011, the Appellant stated that the first time he felt the hardness in the seat
                    was after he got the motorcycle back from Kumar on the night of 11 May 2011. The
                    relevant portion read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20. … After getting all these instructions from Kumar, he asked me
                        to leave… When I sat on my motorcycle, I did not feel any
                        different… However, when I was riding the motorcycle back to my
                        rented place, I went through some bumps and only then, I realized that the
                        seat was a little hard. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In a further statement recorded on 15 November
                    2011, however, the Appellant seemed to have changed his account. He stated that
                    the first time he felt the hardness was after Alagendran returned his
                    motorcycle. We have to observe that this statement of 15 November 2011 was the
                    first time the Appellant brought up the matter of Alagendran borrowing the
                    Appellant’s motorcycle. The relevant portions of the statement
                        read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    At about 8.30pm, Alagendran came back with my
                            motorcycle all done up. He had replaced the damaged parts. He had
                            changed the front cover near the handlebar and also the cushion of the
                            seat… Alagendran then left and then I rode my motorcycle to see
                            Kumar after that. I did not notice anything unusual about my motorcycle
                            as I was riding fast. I only felt that the seat was a little hard but
                            did not think much about it because it is a new seat that was changed by
                            Alagendran.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52.    I have known Alagendran for the past 7

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     During cross-examination, the Appellant
                    changed his position again. This can be gleaned from, first, a portion of the
                    exchange between the Appellant and the Deputy Public Prosecutor
                    (“DPP”) during cross-examination on the third day of
                        trial:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So Mr Devendran, what you are saying is that as you
                            were riding home and going through some humps, you noticed the seat was
                            harder than usual?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Only at certain parts on the humps. After that, it

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The two exchanges indicate that it was likely
                    the Appellant first felt the hardness in the seat only after Kumar returned the
                    motorcycle. Not only did he fail to clarify with the DPP that it was not at
                    midnight but around 8.30pm that he first felt the hardness in the seat, his
                    response to the Judge’s question that it was “already very
                    late” was consistent with his other version of evidence that he first
                    felt the hardness in the motorcycle seat after Kumar returned the motorcycle at
                    about midnight on 11 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     If it were at 8.30pm that he first felt the
                    hardness of the seat, he could possibly have checked it between then and
                    10.00pm, when he rode the motorcycle to meet up with Kumar. Admittedly, this
                    involves speculation on our part. Furthermore, as Mr Wong was not running a
                    positive case, it seemed anything could have been possible – it was
                    equally conceivable that Alagendran was responsible for placing half the amount
                    of the drugs in the seat and Kumar the other half. Equally conceivable, and
                    equally unlikely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It was also conceivable that the hardness had
                    nothing to do with the drugs, and that it was due simply to how the new seat was
                    made. This, however, runs contrary to the Appellant’s own statement that
                    he knew something was in the seat because of the hardness (see above at
                    [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In short, although it is likely the hardness
                    in the seat had to do with the concealed drugs, it was unclear when exactly the
                    Appellant first felt the hardness. Given that it was unclear when exactly the
                    Appellant first felt hardness in his seat, and that his own evidence seems to be
                    inconsistent, his theories are even more difficult to believe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s confessions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The third issue relates to the
                    Appellant’s confessions. As noted above (at [15]), the Judge dealt with
                    the matter of <em>mens rea</em> in three stages. First, he
                    noted that the burden was on the Appellant to rebut the presumption that he knew
                    of the drugs in the motorcycle seat. He found that the Appellant failed to do
                    so. Second, he found that the Appellant was wilfully blind. Third, he found that
                    the Appellant’s confessions “confirmed [his] decision” (the
                    GD at [62]). It is this third point which we now wish to consider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The “confessions” were made in
                    the statements recorded on 15 and 16 May 2011. The
                    “confession” contained in the statement recorded on 15 May
                    2011 reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I want the court to quickly deal with the matter and after I am
                        being hanged, to send my body back to my parents as early as possible
                        because my father is a heart patient and my father’s 2nd wife is also
                        not in good health. My family is in great difficulties and they will not be
                        in a position to come and visit me very often. As such, I do not want to
                        cause problem to my family, the officers who are involved in this case, the
                        Singapore government. I want to plead guilty to the offence as quickly as I
                        could and I also want to be punished as early as possible. I do not want to
                        be punished very late after I had already pleaded guilty because if my
                        father comes to know about this matter in the meantime, he may die of the
                        shock. For the past 14 years, I have been away from my family and have been
                        staying with them only for the past 4 months. I do not want to hear of my
                        parent’s death while I am alive. Even now while I am in the lock up
                        here, I could hear my parent’s voice crying and weeping for me. If I
                        remain in the lock up for long, I will get mad. Hence, when I appear in
                        Court on the 20th of this month, I will admit to the charge and I want to be
                        punished immediately. I request the recording officer in this matter to help
                        me do this favour. I am prepared to fall on your feet to seek this favour.
                        That’s all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>To appreciate the statement in the preceding paragraph in its
                        proper context, it should be noted that this was said when the Appellant was
                        asking the interviewer “two questions”. The first question was
                        “[i]f I admit to the charge, how quickly would I be dealt with the
                        matter, and punished by the judge?” In response, the interviewer
                        stated “[i]t depends on the court”. This led on to the second
                        “question”, which was in essence the Appellant’s
                        “confession” as transcribed and replicated
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The “confession” contained in
                    the statement recorded on 16 May 2011 reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    … One of the 2 persons, either Kumar or Gobi
                            had made use of my situation of needing a loan and put me in this
                            situation. Since I rode the motorcycle into Singapore, and the drugs
                            were taken from my motorcycle, I am to be blamed and that is the reason
                            I wish to plead guilty. By remaining in custody, I do not want to waste
                            time and cause worries to my parents as I had been living with them only
                            for the past 4 months. I have been an orphan for 14 years and after my
                            death, I do not want to go away as an orphan. Hence, I wish to plead
                            guilty early and have my punishment early. <b>In order

                            have died because both of them are sick. <b>Even though
                                if I am able to prove my innocence</b>, I would at least be
                            punished for 10 years because that drugs were found in my motorcycle. I
                            am ready to face death and the earlier the better. [emphasis added in
                            bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Although we agree with the Judge that the
                    voluntariness of these statements are beyond reproach, we have our doubts as to
                    whether these portions can truly be construed as his confessions within the
                    meaning of s 17 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), that is,
                    “[admissions]… stating or suggesting the inference that he
                    committed [the] offence”. Just because the Appellant said he wanted to
                    plead guilty does not necessarily mean he was admitting to the commission of the
                    offence. As pointed out by Mr Wong, it seemed that the Appellant’s intent
                    to “plead guilty to the offence” as stated in the
                    “confessions” was motivated more by a desire on the part of the
                    Appellant that he wished his “ordeal to be over in the quickest possible
                        way”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and to return to his parents rather
                    than by a desire to come clean. In particular, we observe that his reference to
                    “in order to prove my innocence, I cannot remain in prison for 3 or 4
                    years”, shows that he was far from admitting his guilt. For these
                    reasons, we find that the statements do not bear out a clear admission of his
                    wrongdoing and as such we do not think it is safe to rely on them in reviewing
                    the entire case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Having dealt with the three preliminary
                    issues, we propose to analyse the key points of Mr Wong’s case. To
                    recapitulate, he was not running a positive case before us. Rather, he sought to
                    raise “alternative theories” to explain how the drugs <em>could have</em> made their way into the seat of the
                    Appellant’s motorcycle. All these theories had been raised before, and
                    considered by, the Judge. As such, the burden he faced was not simply to
                    convince us of those theories, but to satisfy us that the Judge had wrongly
                    rejected them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We start with Mr Wong’s arguments
                    relating to the Alagendran Theory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Alagendran Theory</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mr Wong’s main arguments in relation to
                    the Alagendran Theory are two-fold. First, he seeks to explain away the
                    six-month delay between the time when the Appellant was arrested and when he
                    first mentioned about Alagendran (see above at [15(d)(i)]). Mr Wong’s
                    reason was that after the Appellant recorded his further statement on 17 May
                    2011, he had made repeated requests to meet the Investigating Officer but these
                    were in vain; the Investigating Officer was only able to meet him on 15 November
                    2011 to record a further statement. It was during the recording of that
                    statement on 15 November 2011 that the Appellant first brought up
                    Alagendran. The Judge concluded from this that “it had taken the accused
                    about 6 months before he decided to inform the investigation officer about
                    Alagendran” (the GD at [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We accept Mr Wong’s point that the
                    Appellant might have wanted to tell the Investigating Officer about Alagendran
                    earlier. The fact that he requested to meet the Investigating Officer between 17
                    May 2011 and 15 November 2011 was not disputed by the Prosecution. We
                    therefore accept that the six-month lapse should not be fatal to the Alagendran
                    Theory. That said, it is curious why the Appellant had not brought Alagendran up
                    between 12 and 17 May 2011. Mr Wong’s explanation that
                    “[h]e did not think that the events surrounding Alagendran would be
                        relevant”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> is hardly credible. If he were
                    innocent, why did he not state the events concerning Alagendran if that were the
                    truth? He could not have forgotten those events which happened on the day before
                    he left for Singapore. If they were not relevant at that time (between 12 and 17
                    May), how did they “become” relevant later on? If anything, this
                    supports the notion that the Alagendran Theory was simply an afterthought. Mr
                    Wong’s reply to this was that the Appellant only managed to collect his
                    thoughts in prison, and it was only then that he recalled the events surrounding
                        Alagendran.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> We find this strange indeed. Even more
                    curious is the fact that when the Appellant did eventually bring up Alagendran,
                    he introduced him as “Agilan’s younger brother”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> However, he
                    first mentioned “his friend Agilan” as early as 14 May
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Agilan
                    featured not only as his housemate but his creditor on at least two occasions
                    – he borrowed RM1,000 from him to purchase his motorcycle and, more
                    recently, RM500 to post bail for his step-brother. Why did he not mention
                    Alagendran and the fight he was involved in when the Appellant talked about
                    Agilan?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The second point raised by Mr Wong is in
                    relation to “proof” that the fight that caused the damage to the
                    motorcycle seat did in fact take place. To prove this, he relied on a text
                    message from an individual named Puspa. Mr Wong stated Puspa was
                    Alagendran’s elder sister.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The
                    relevant text messages that Mr Wong relied on were, first, a message sent from
                    the Appellant to Puspa at 9.11pm on 11 May 2011. It read, “Don’t
                    wry I tc alagu ok relax”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He also relied on what was
                    presumably the reply from Puspa at 9.15pm on the same day, which read
                    “Raja anna alagenrava partukunga anna sandaiku yellam pogatinga
                    anna”. According to Mr Wong’s translation in his written
                    submission, this was a request by Puspa for the Appellant to take care of
                    Alagendran and make sure that Alagendran would not get involved in any more
                        fights.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As is apparent, there are problems with this
                    text message exchange. First, even if we accept that the entire text exchange is
                    genuine, and that Mr Wong’s translation is accurate, it does not
                    necessarily lead to the conclusion the Appellant is seeking to establish. At
                    best, a fight may have taken place. There is no indication that the motorcycle
                    was indeed damaged in the fight. Neither is there any indication that the
                    motorcycle was sent away for repairs. Second, the identity of Puspa is far from
                    clear. Mr Wong claims Puspa was Alagendran’s sister. However, in the
                    Appellant’s statement recorded on 17 May 2011, the Appellant identified
                    Puspa as “my relative who stays in Johor Bahru”. We find that this
                    text message exchange does not assist the Appellant’s case and, if
                    anything, raises more questions than answers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In sum, the fact that the Appellant failed to
                    allude to the Alagendran events in his earlier statements does seriously
                    undermine the genuineness of that claim. It is inconceivable that anyone, if
                    innocent and placed in that situation could have missed mentioning such a
                    crucial event. In any case, the theory was not plausible given the
                    inconsistencies in the Appellant’s evidence, most pertinently on when
                    exactly he felt the hardness in the seat of the motorcycle and who Puspa was.
                    There was also the larger question of why Alagendran would have wanted to
                    “plant” the drugs in the motorcycle. Not only was their
                    relationship amicable,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> there was no indication of an overarching plot
                    that connected Alagendran and Kumar such that the transportation of the drugs
                    was connected with the “planting” of the drugs in the motorcycle
                    seat. We agree with the Judge that this theory was inherently
                    unbelievable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Kumar Theory</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Wong’s main point in relation to the
                    Kumar Theory was that the Judge placed undue weight on the Appellant’s
                    failure to mention Gobi in his cautioned statement on 12 May 2011. The
                    Appellant’s account of the events touching on Gobi was disclosed in the
                    following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the Appellant’s cautioned
                        statement recorded on 12 May 2011, the Appellant’s account left no
                        room for Gobi. He stated that he “approached a friend of mine”
                        to get some money. That friend took him to “another friend”,
                        from whom he could get more money. That other friend, in turn, took him to
                        see “a man”. His account of his interaction with the man (who
                        was eventually revealed to be Kumar) was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">The man promised me that he will help me. He further asked me
                                whether I have a motorcycle. When I said yes, he asked me to bring
                                the bike to him. He also asked me whether I had been to Singapore. I
                                told him I had ever been there. So at about 10pm yesterday, I rode
                                my bike to a coffeeshop. The man told me to come back 2 hours later.
                                So at about 12 midnight, I returned to the coffeshop.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">The man told me that I had to ride my motor into Singapore and
                                told me to wait at a bus stop just before a Caltex petrol kiosk. He
                                told me that someone would come and take my bike away. He told me to
                                leave the place and to return to the same place at about 12 in the
                                afternoon. The person who took away my bike will then return my
                                bike. I did what he told me to do. He said that he would pay me when
                                I go back to see him in the evening. He paid me the 1500

                        in the statement recorded on 14 May 2011, that the Appellant’s account
                        of events opened an avenue for Gobi to feature. In this statement, he
                        identified Kumar as well. The relevant portion of the statement
                            reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">14    … Kumar then told me that he knew
                                someone who lends money on interest and that he would talk to him
                                first. Kumar then used his handphone and called someone. I overheard
                                Kumar telling the other person that I was with him and that I have
                                come to ask for a loan on an interest basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">15    After talking to the person, Kumar handed his
                                handphone to me and asked me to talk to the person also. I took over
                                the handphone and spoke to the person who is a

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the statement recorded on 15 May 2011, the Appellant made no mention of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the
                        statement recorded on 16 May 2011, the Appellant was shown his hand phone
                        and asked to identify the person who asked him to do “this
                        job”. He identified the contact named “Vije maccan,
                        spore”, and stated that the person behind the contact went by the
                        moniker “Gobi”. The relevant portions reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">33    … I wish to state that I have heard
                                people calling this person as Gobi but I do not know whether this is
                                his actual name.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>He also provided details of Gobi’s appearance and
                            stated that he had met Gobi on two previous occasions. Crucially, the
                            Appellant stated that “when Kumar handed over the phone and asked
                            me to speak to the person who was supposed to give me the loan… I
                            knew the person is Gobi when I spoke to him because he told me his
                                name…”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> He explained that
                            he did not mention Gobi in his earlier statements because he did not
                            want to implicate him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_e"></a>(e)     During cross-examination, the Appellant was asked if he
                        was close to Gobi at all. The Appellant replied that he was not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> He was also asked why there
                        was no contact by the name of “Gobi” saved in his hand phone.
                        The Appellant replied that Gobi told him to save the number under the
                        contact named “Vije maccan”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As we see it, the Appellant was less than
                    forthright in advancing the Kumar Theory. It would be seen that he was reluctant
                    to make full disclosure at the beginning. Mr Wong attempted to explain the
                    situation by postulating that on 12 May 2011, the Appellant was in a
                    “state of panic at having been arrested for an offence he was innocent
                        of”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Even if this were the case, it is hard
                    to reconcile his initial “state of panic” with his subsequent
                    explanation that he was all along, in a presumably calculated manner, attempting
                    to shield Gobi from any possible implication (which is itself a problematic
                    excuse as he was not even certain if “Gobi” were simply a
                    moniker). Furthermore, according to the very first statement, it seems Kumar was
                    the only person that the Appellant dealt with; there was no mention of Kumar
                    calling anyone, let alone Gobi, on his hand phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     There were further complications that arose.
                    The phone number attributed to Gobi was traced and the registered owner was
                    identified. However, the Appellant was unable to single out the photograph of
                    the registered owner from a series of twelve photographs. Mr Wong argued that
                    the Judge placed “undue weight on [the Appellant’s] failure to
                    identify Gobi” from this series of photographs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> We accept Mr Wong’s contention that
                    Gobi’s number may indeed have been registered under someone else’s
                    name. However, that misses the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It bears repeating that the burden was on the
                    Appellant to prove that he did not have the <em>mens
                        rea</em>. It was in his effort to discharge this burden that he
                    attempted to construct an explanation of how the drugs could have made their way
                    into his motorcycle seat. One of the explanations he relied on was the Kumar
                    Theory, a key plank of which was “Gobi”. The Appellant’s
                    failure to identify Gobi, along with the surrounding problematic issues (his
                    questionable desire to shield Gobi from implication, the apparently inconsistent
                    reasons at attempting to explain why Gobi was not mentioned in the earlier
                    statements, and his unquestioning compliance to Gobi’s request that he
                    save his contact under a moniker) mean this key plank is of dubious origin. The
                    onus is on the Appellant to establish his explanation (in this case, the Kumar
                    Theory). Given these jarring gaps, he has failed to do so. This was what the
                    Judge concluded (the GD at [42]), and rightly so. It was not simply the
                    Appellant’s failure to identify Gobi that was critical. Rather, his
                    failure simply added on to the plethora of gaps in the Kumar Theory as to make
                    it implausible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other suspicious circumstances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the result, we find that the Judge was
                    correct in dismissing either theory as implausible. We note that there are
                    further suspicious circumstances that justify the Judge’s finding that the
                    Appellant was indeed wilfully blind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     First, the Appellant stated that on the night
                    of 11 May 2011, Kumar told him to erase his contact details from his hand phone.
                    The Appellant complied with this request.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> It is
                    curious why the Appellant would have simply agreed to delete his phone records.
                    At the very least, even if he chose to comply with the request, he should have
                    been alerted that something was amiss. Mr Wong emphasised before us that the
                    Appellant did not know how drug syndicates worked. Although he may not have
                    known about the intricacies of drug trafficking, he had been exposed to drugs in
                    the past. On the Appellant’s own account, he had consumed drugs
                        before.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> He had also been arrested and jailed for drug
                    consumption in 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> At the very least, these previous encounters
                    must have alerted him to the prevalence of drugs in the region.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Second, notwithstanding the suspicious
                    circumstances around the “loan arrangement” (notably,
                    Kumar’s borrowing the motorcycle between 10.00pm and midnight on 11 May
                    2011, the need for the Appellant to ride into Singapore and <em>then</em> pass the motorcycle to someone else, and the need to delete
                    phone records and use monikers) coupled with the Appellant’s awareness of
                    the hardness in the seat, the Appellant never once bothered to stop and check
                    the seat. His reasons were that (1) the hardness was a minor issue, as he only
                    felt it while going over humps, (2) he was in a rush, and (3) he was preoccupied
                    with thoughts about his step-brother. Mr Wong proffered a fourth reason –
                    investigating the cause of the hardness of the seat would have been
                        tedious.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The first reason can be disposed of based on
                    the Appellant’s statement on 12 May 2011 that he “knew something
                    was stuffed inside his motorcycle seat” because “he felt something
                        hard”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Even if he only felt the hardness while going
                    over humps, it was clear that he was alerted to the possibility that something
                    was hidden inside the seat and yet he chose to ignore it and embarked on a
                    journey to Singapore with the unusual instructions that he was to let someone
                    else have use of the motorcycle for some two hours after he had cleared
                    Singapore Customs. The second and third reasons lose their appeal when
                    juxtaposed with the chronology. If indeed it was Alagendran who placed the drugs
                    in the seat, and that this was when the Appellant first felt the hardness, then
                    he had some time (between 8.30pm and 10.00pm on 11 May 2011) to check the seat.
                    If it was only after midnight when he first felt the hardness, at the very least
                    he could have checked the seat when he stopped for a smoke break just before
                    crossing the Johor Customs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> As noted by the Judge, the
                    Appellant was no stranger to the stringent process of clearance at the Singapore
                    Woodlands Checkpoint, having hitherto travelled into Singapore on multiple
                    occasions (the GD at [47]). Despite this, and the series of peculiar events that
                    preceded his entry into Singapore, the Appellant chose to turn a blind
                    eye.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We note also that Mr Wong’s emphasis on
                    the tediousness of the process of checking the seat – the fourth reason
                    – may be overstated. Mr Wong relied on the process undertaken by the
                    CNB officer to dismantle the seat to evince how cumbersome the process
                        was.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> However, it took the CNB
                    officer no longer than fifteen minutes to dismantle the seat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, all the tools he used to effect the dismantling were found on the
                        motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Viewing the situation as a whole, the entire
                    arrangement relating to the “loan” transaction would have aroused
                    the suspicion of any reasonable person who was just a genuine borrower. The
                    Appellant attempted to explain away certain portions; for instance, he stated
                    that he had to come into Singapore for a job interview on the morning of 12 May
                        2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and
                    hence Kumar’s request for him to travel to Singapore did not seem so
                    outlandish, given that he had to make the trip in any case. However, and this is
                    assuming there was indeed an interview in Singapore that the Appellant was
                    headed to, the two points (Kumar’s instructions on the one hand and the
                    interview on the other) were at best tangentially related. It was not the
                    Appellant’s case, for instance, that Kumar had only asked him to ride into
                    Singapore after having found out about his interview. Taking the
                    Appellant’s case at its highest, it may have <em>coincidentally</em> been less tedious for the Appellant to adhere to
                    Kumar’s instructions. However, that did not make Kumar’s
                    instructions any less suspicious. More importantly, this explanation of the
                    Appellant’s was characteristic of his approach throughout this case
                    – he devised neat theories to seemingly patch up doubtful areas in his
                    case. However, when looked at as a whole, the inconsistencies within and between
                    theories, oft times amounting to seeming contradictions, betrayed the true
                    nature of these theories; they were simply afterthoughts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We find that there is enough on the facts to
                    give rise to suspicion. Yet, the Appellant made a deliberate decision not to
                    investigate or inquire further. He opted to be wilfully blind towards the
                    presence of diamorphine in the motorcycle seat (see <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [127]). In the
                    circumstances, there is no basis for us to disturb the finding of the Judge that
                    the Appellant has not discharged the burden, pursuant to s 18(2) of the
                    MDA, of proving that he had no <em>mens rea</em> as to the
                    existence of the drugs which was stuffed in his motorcycle seat. In any event,
                    even reviewing the evidence afresh, we do not think the Appellant has discharged
                    the burden, on a balance of probability, that he had no <em>mens
                        rea</em> as to the diamorphine found hidden in his motorcycle
                    seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the reasons above, we dismiss the
                    Appellant’s appeal against conviction. As the appeal against sentence is
                    purely consequential and no specific arguments have been raised by the Appellant
                    as to the propriety of the sentence imposed, and as we also do not see that the
                    sentence imposed is in any way improper, we would affirm the sentence and
                    dismiss the appeal against sentence.</p>
