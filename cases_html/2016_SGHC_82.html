</div> Smuggling activities undermine the integrity of Singapore’s trading system, and more importantly our efforts to reduce the consumption of harmful goods. Between 2013 and 2015, about three million packets of duty unpaid cigarettes were seized each year, a figure that is double of that in 2012. Furthermore, while the number of persons prosecuted for cigarette offences declined from 2010 to a low in 2013, there has been an unfortunate slight rebound over the past two years.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 During the appeal before me, the Prosecution contends that a custodial sentence of more than 24 months’ imprisonment should be imposed on the Respondent. In support of its position, the Prosecution makes the following points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Although the sentencing benchmark in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> related to the importation of duty unpaid cigarettes under s 128F of the Customs Act, there should be no meaningful variation in sentencing benchmarks between the offences in ss 128F and 128H since under the statutory scheme of the Customs Act, the various acts constituting the offences under both provisions are treated with equivalency. A common starting point in sentence should apply, and the sentencing benchmarks set in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> should be taken into account when sentencing the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Recent precedents for offences under s 128H of the Customs Act show a general adherence to the sentencing benchmarks in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span>, as well as the trend that the sentences imposed for s 128H offences post-<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> are generally proportional to the quantity of the duty unpaid cigarettes involved. The Prosecution tendered the following graph in its submissions to illustrate this point:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The District Judge did not give sufficient weight to the large quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes involved, as well as the enhanced role the Respondent played in collecting, delivering and unloading the said cigarettes (see [5] above), as opposed to the co-accused’s role in only unloading the cigarettes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The District Judge had erred in failing to apply the principle of parity in sentencing in the present case. The co-accused’s sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment cannot be described as erroneously harsh, and there should not be inconsistent treatment between the two cases.

The other offences in the old s 130 of the Customs Act 1995 have also been re-organised after the old s 130 was repealed: for example, the offence of storing uncustomed goods in the old s 130(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is now found in s 128I(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is significant that the penalty regime did not change significantly when the offences were re-organised. The same statutorily provided minimum and maximum fines for all specified offences apply, and for cases involving more than 2 kg of tobacco products, the regime under the old ss 130(iii) and (iv) of the Customs Act 1995 has not changed except for the fact that for first-time offenders, the sentence imposed can now be fines and/or imprisonment or both (see s 128L(4) reproduced above), instead of fines and imprisonment previously. There is still no differentiated treatment in the magnitude of penalties imposed on the different acts in the chain of “steps” that form the composite act of cigarette smuggling. Thus, the re-organisation and splitting of the offences were made for the purpose of comprehensibility, as opposed to an intention to differentiate between them substantively with separate sentencing schemes. Then Minister of State for Finance Mrs Lim Hwee Hua’s comments on the re-classification are apposite (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Reports</span> (22 January 2008) vol 84 at col 249):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Simplification</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> of penalty provisions and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">streamlining</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> the enforcement regime</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sir, I shall now move on to the second category of amendments that <span class="font-italic">simplify and streamline the current penalty provisions and the enforcement regime</span> under the Customs Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Re-classifying</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> customs offences</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The next change relates to the <span class="font-italic">re-classification of customs offences</span> by mode of commission of the offences.

In these cases, it is necessary and more appropriate to distinguish for the purpose of sentencing between the offending physical acts of smuggling on the one hand and the offender’s ownership, management, control and responsibility in the hierarchy of a smuggling syndicate on the other: the former being the offending action that triggers the corresponding provision under the Customs Act (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> loading, importing, unloading, delivering, etc. which are physical acts normally carried out by paid workers within the smuggling enterprise) and the latter being the extent or the level of control of the offender in the criminal enterprise (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the offender is the owner of the criminal enterprise enjoying the profits derived from the criminal activities and/or whether he plays a leading or active management role within the criminal enterprise), which is a separate and an exceptionally serious aggravating factor in sentencing. The District Judge seems to have slightly conflated the two considerations when she states that “not all offences under section 128 [of the Customs Act] can be placed on the same level of seriousness” (presumably referring to the whole gamut of different possible offending physical <span class="font-italic">acts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of smuggling) before discussing the <span class="font-italic">role</span> of the offender where she differentiates between leaders and underlings (see [17] of the GD). She then goes on to state that “the charge preferred against the accused (the present Respondent) encapsulated his <span class="font-italic">role</span>, which was to unload the duty unpaid cigarettes and to bring them to the unit [<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>his <span class="font-italic">act</span>]” (emphasis added) (see [19] of the GD). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 However, the culpability of two “low-level” offenders as paid workers in the syndicate could be <span class="font-italic">equally</span> minor, even if one was involved in importing at the start of the chain and the other in unloading at the end when compared to the much higher culpability of one who substantially owns or has major control of the smuggling syndicate. If one considers the various offending physical acts needed to carry out a smuggling operation, it is perhaps fortuitous that an offender, a mere paid worker within the criminal smuggling enterprise hypothetically involved in the whole chain at every step, was caught at one step, and not another. The level of culpability inherent in the different physical acts carried out by a paid worker in the smuggling chain can be regarded as largely similar. I cannot see any real or substantive distinction in the worker’s culpability for these various individual physical acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 <span class="font-italic">Ceteris paribus</span>, the type of offending act in the smuggling chain (want of any further details) should not have any serious bearing on the analysis that requires a significant differentiation to be made to the extent of the culpability of a worker employed to carry out different physical stages of the smuggling activity involving the same quantity of uncustomed goods. However, where the offender has a further involvement in owning, managing and/or controlling the smuggling enterprise, I would regard that to be a very serious aggravating factor that calls for a substantial differentiation in culpability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Thus, I am of the view that the sentencing benchmarks set in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> for the importation of duty unpaid cigarettes under s 128F of the Customs Act are relevant and applicable to the sentencing of offences of unloading (and other acts such as delivery, loading, unloading etc.) under s 128H of the Customs Act carried out by paid workers on behalf of a smuggling syndicate. A common starting point should apply, with adjustments upwards and downwards for other aggravating and mitigating factors not already implicit or captured within the reference benchmark cases, as each case must necessarily turn on its precise facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Benchmark sentences for cigarette smuggling offences</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Developing benchmark sentences and sentencing frameworks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As Yong Pung How CJ in <span class="font-italic">Abu </span><span class="font-italic">Syeed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 182 at [15] puts it:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A “benchmark” is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. … It … provides the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined. A good “benchmark” decision therefore lays down carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the “norm”, and what exceptional situations justify departure from it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 A good sentencing framework thus provides the analytical frame of reference to allow the sentencing judge to achieve a reasoned, fair and appropriate sentence in line with other like cases while having due regard to the facts of each particular case. Such guidelines also promote public confidence in sentencing, and enhance sentencing transparency and accountability in the administration of criminal justice. Broad consistency in sentencing also provides society with a clear understanding of what and how the law seeks to punish and allows for members of society to have regard to this in arranging their own affairs and making their own choices.

In particular, Menon CJ laid out benchmark sentences for the importation of duty unpaid cigarettes in the form of a graduated scheme in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Lai</span>, with the key parameter being the quantity of tobacco product involved which determines as a starting point the duration of imprisonment term to be imposed. This framework was established as a guide for the standard or archetypal offender which was defined (at [40]) as one:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) who is a first-time offender;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) who pleads guilty at the earliest opportunity; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whose role is limited to pure importation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> not an enhanced <span class="font-italic">role</span> beyond committing the <span class="font-italic">act</span> in the charge preferred).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 One approach to developing sentencing frameworks and benchmarks can be broadly described as encompassing the following steps:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) analyse the mischief targeted by the offence and the sentencing principles relevant to the offence in question;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) identify the primary factor(s) that would affect the length of the sentence, as well as other mitigating and aggravating factors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) engage in scenario analysis, and set the standard/archetypal offender;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) derive the benchmarks for the standard case and any other scenarios; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) test and calibrate the benchmarks against existing precedent cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Apart from my previous observations in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Chian Yow Joseph Brian</span> [2016] 2 SLR 335 at [42]–[46] on the development of benchmark sentences, I also further note that the framework should seek to capture the cases that make up the bulk of everyday sentencing practice, with room for departure for justice by allowing for upward and downward adjustments based on each particular case’s facts and circumstances. For practical purposes and utility, the standard case should thus be analysed and set as the <span class="font-italic">typical</span> offender and situation for the particular offence, having regard also to the observations of cases that come before the courts. Where possible, quantitative sentencing data should be employed to aid the development of the framework for greater rigour. The following principles should also be kept in mind:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sentencing guides or guideline judgments are judicial creations not meant to usurp the Legislature, and legislative intention should always be adhered to when the offence is statutorily enacted (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Chee Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Chee Eng</span>”) at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Consequently, the full sentencing range available to the judge should be considered and incorporated into the sentencing calculus. The court’s role is to ensure that the <span class="font-italic">full</span> spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence in the case at hand (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>where within the available range does the offender’s conduct fall: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Kwong Kok Hing </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at [44]), and thus give effect to the legislated maximum and/or minimum sentences.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The concept of sentencing consistency extends to consistency in both <span class="font-italic">outcome</span> and <span class="font-italic">approach</span>. However, sentencing parity and consistency are not “empty” end goals by themselves. Adhering to the principle of “like cases being treated alike” would not achieve substantive justice if the sentences in the reference cases were unjust or irrational in the first place. Thus, the “logic” of the set of reference cases has to be internally sound and coherent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In structuring the sentencing framework for coherence and logic, proportionality in sentencing to the culpability of the offender and to the seriousness of harm caused by the crime should be key considerations (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Law Aik Meng</span>”) at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Sentencing precedents that are unreasoned and unreported are of relatively little precedential value (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>at [11(d)], and also <span class="font-italic">Ong Chee Eng</span> at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Judicial discretion underpins just sentencing, and sentencing benchmarks and frameworks must be capable of being simply yet <span class="font-italic">flexibly</span> applied with due regard to the facts (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> at [12] and also <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> at [43]). These are analytical tools meant to aid, and not hamper, judicial discretion to achieve both consistency and individualised justice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Note on the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Yap Ah Lai</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">benchmarks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The present situation is not one where sentencing benchmarks are being newly calibrated <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. The Prosecution submits, and I agree, that a common starting point should apply for offences under ss 128F and 128H of the Customs Act, and that the sentencing benchmarks set in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> for the former provision for the offence of <span class="font-italic">importing</span> should be taken into account when sentencing the Respondent for his offence of <span class="font-italic">unloading</span> (see above at [13(a)]–[13(b)] and [14]–[26]). From the “twin objectives” of preventing a loss of revenue to the Government and discouraging the consumption of harmful goods as a matter of public policy and interest by raising the cost of such goods through the imposition of high excise duties on them, it was rationalised that the primary factor to be considered in sentencing for tobacco product smuggling offences would be the quantity of tobacco products that is involved (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> at [23]–[29], [35] and [57(b)]). Hence, proportionality to the harm caused by the crime is achieved by calibrating the sentence generally to the quantity of duty unpaid tobacco products involved as a starting point. Proportionality to the culpability of the offender would then be achieved by further downward and upward adjustments after taking into account other relevant mitigating and aggravating factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In line with the necessary rigour of developing a sound sentencing framework for importation cases, Menon CJ’s exercise in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> disregarded four non-importation cases (involving various acts of delivery, storage and unloading) tabled as precedents by the Prosecution, which were considered not directly relevant and where the offenders were considered by the court to have each taken a “<span class="font-italic">more active role</span> in the act of smuggling” (emphasis added) in comparison with a typical benchmark importation case “where the offender’s <span class="font-italic">sole</span> role was to <span class="font-italic">transport</span> contraband cigarettes into Singapore” (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> at [40]–[45]). The fact that those four non-importation cases were disregarded for being irrelevant comparables outside the area of focus of the benchmarking analysis does not necessarily indicate that the sentencing scheme in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> cannot apply to cases of delivery or unloading <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I have slightly retooled Graph 1, which the Prosecution tendered in its submissions:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Instead of a curve, the gradated benchmarks set in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> are now presented as red shaded areas for easier comparison with the sentences imposed in post-<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> s 128H cases represented by the blue round-shaped markers. The exact plot values and other relevant information for the s 128H sentencing precedents can be found in Annex A at the end of this judgment. For these sentencing precedents, the offenders had all pleaded guilty, were not youthful offenders, and did not play leading or active management roles within the criminal enterprise. They were either paid workers engaged by others or had acted on their own (and not part of a syndicate). Three observations from Graph 2 must be noted:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The blue markers generally fall within or very close to the red shaded areas; the recent sentencing precedents under s 128H of the Customs Act generally adhere to the sentencing benchmarks set in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The blue markers increase largely linearly in proportion to the increase in the weight of the duty unpaid cigarettes along the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis, as represented by the blue trend-line derived from the blue data points; like the sentencing framework laid down in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span>, there is a rational and fairly proportional relationship between the increase in the sentence imposed and <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">increase in the quantity of duty unpaid tobacco products involved</span> for post-<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>sentences for offences under s 128H of the Customs Act. This must be expected as dealing with a larger quantity of duty unpaid tobacco product must logically entail an increase in the degree of criminal culpability, and hence a corresponding general increase in the sentence imposed, when all other factors are held constant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Respondent’s sentence, represented by the green triangle marker, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> seems like a clear outlier against both the <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>benchmarks (the red shaded areas), as well as the post-<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>s 128H sentencing precedents (blue markers).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Major factors that influence the benchmark sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Moey</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 867 (“<span class="font-italic">Moey</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Kong</span>”), Yong CJ identified at [10] five significant factors relevant to sentencing for customs offences under s 130(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Customs Act 1995 (in relation to a case of importation of uncustomed cigars hidden in a vehicle):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the amount of duty evaded, the quantity of goods involved, repetition of the offence, whether the offender was acting on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation, and the role of the offender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> (at [28]–[32]), Menon CJ distilled these five factors into the following four factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) quantity of tobacco product involved (which would have a direct and virtually linear correlation to the amount of duty evaded);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) repetition of the offence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the offender was acting on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the role of the offender.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes involved</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As identified in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> (at [27] and [35]), the “primary factor” or “key parameter” that influences the length of sentence for a Customs Act offence involving cigarette smuggling would be the quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes (or for that matter, any other tobacco products) involved. This is the <span class="font-italic">key indicator</span> of the seriousness of the crime, and directly correlates to the mischief targeted by the specified offences under the Customs Act. As Menon CJ pointed out at [29], this has a “direct and virtually linear correlation to the amount of duty evaded”, and hence the two factors (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> amount of duty evaded and the quantity of goods involved) should be regarded together.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Repetition of the offence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Customs Act already provides for enhanced sentences for repeat Customs Act offenders dealing with duty unpaid tobacco products: see ss 128L(3), 128L(5) and 128L(5A) of the Customs Act. Thus, this factor need not be included in the particular sentencing calculus for offenders sentenced under s 128L(4) of the Customs Act for the first time. Any other relevant non-Customs Act antecedents can still be treated as an aggravating factor that adjusts the sentence upwards within the sentencing framework (see [44] below and also <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether offender acted on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 If an offender was involved in a syndicated operation, it would be an aggravating factor that justifies an enhanced sentence in the interest of general deterrence (see <span class="font-italic">Law Aik Meng</span> at [25(b)]). This would thus be an aggravating factor not present in the standard case that requires an upward adjustment. However, I am of the view that a nuanced approach has to be taken in relation to this aggravating factor to avoid over-penalising the offender who is merely a paid worker working on behalf of the syndicate and is therefore fairly low down in the management hierarchy of the criminal syndicate having no share in the profits of the smuggling enterprise nor any management control of the syndicate. Let me explain. In most cases where substantial quantities of duty unpaid cigarettes are found, syndicates would also most likely be involved. Assume a hypothetical case in which a fairly substantial amount of 200 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes is involved. If the offender “X” runs that fairly large smuggling operation all by himself and is therefore not involved in any syndicate, is he to be considered more or less culpable in comparison with (a) a person “A” who is the mastermind and the main partner of a syndicate involved in smuggling the <span class="font-italic">same</span> quantity of 200 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes; and (b) a person “B” who is a mere paid worker helping “A” with the physical loading, importation, delivery and/or subsequent unloading of the same quantity of 200 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes on behalf of the syndicate? All other things being equal, it is my view that “X” should be regarded as less culpable than “A” because “X” is not involved in a syndicate, but “X” should be regarded as much more culpable than “B” despite the fact that “B” may be involved in the syndicate, because the culpability of “X” is much elevated due to the fact of “X”’s ownership and control over a large-scale smuggling operation, though not in a syndicate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Extent of role in smuggling</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Next, the extent of the offender’s role in the smuggling enterprise has to be taken into account. The court will thus consider the level of his ownership/management control or share in profits earned from the smuggling enterprise and the extent of his participation in the physical acts that are a part of smuggling operations. As I alluded to above at [23]–[24], it is necessary to distinguish between the offending <span class="font-italic">act</span> and the actual extent of the offender’s <span class="font-italic">role</span> including whether he has overall ownership control and/or management functions in the smuggling syndicate. In cases where the extent of the offender’s involvement is encapsulated in the sole act and hence captured within the preferred charge (for example, the act of delivering under s 128H of the Customs Act), this factor would be neutral in the sentencing calculus. On the other hand, where the extent of the offender’s involvement goes <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> the charge preferred (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>his acts in the smuggling operation extended beyond the offending act of delivering captured under s 128H to also include loading and unloading, sharing in the profits, and having management control of the smuggling enterprise), the offender’s enhanced role and added physical participation in the smuggling operation would be an aggravating factor requiring an upward adjustment from the sentencing benchmark.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Impact of guilty plea</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Beyond the factors discussed in <span class="font-italic">Moey</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Kong</span> and <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span>, the sentencing framework for s 128H offences should also consider the impact of a timely plea of guilt showing genuine remorse which would merit a sentencing discount (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 at [36]). Since the standard case in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> already factors this in (see above at [29(b)]), the case where the offender <span class="font-italic">did not</span> plead guilty at the earliest opportunity or had claimed trial would attract an upward adjustment above the benchmarks.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Age of offender</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It is trite law that youthfulness is a valid ground for extending leniency, and that the primary sentencing consideration for youthful offenders will generally be rehabilitation (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Mok Ping Wuen Maurice</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 439 (“<span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Ping Wuen Maurice</span>”) at [21] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen </span><span class="font-italic">Jie Boaz </span>[2016] 1 SLR 334 at [29]–[30]). The sentencing framework being explored and laid down in this case is thus restricted to situations where the conditions <span class="font-italic">do not</span> exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable or appropriate, for example when the offender is a foreign national or when the offender is hardened and recalcitrant. Where youthfulness is a factor, a sentencing discount can be applied to the benchmark arrived at in the framework (see [55] and Table 3 below) to account for the fact that a youthful offender lacks maturity and may not have fully realised the nature and consequences of his or her criminal actions at the time of the offence. All other things being equal, it is reasonable and logical to assume that the younger the age of the offender, the greater will be the immaturity and the lack of understanding of the nature and consequences of the offender’s conduct, and hence the greater should be the discount to the benchmark sentence generally. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Other aggravating and mitigating factors such as prior non-Customs Acts antecedents or elements of personal mitigation beyond the factors listed above present in each case would also then apply as upward or downward adjustments accordingly to the sentencing benchmark arrived at in the framework set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Scenarios and the standard base case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I now proceed to analyse the two likely scenarios for situations under ss 128H (and 128F) of the Customs Act in relation to an offender dealing with duty unpaid cigarettes, and set out the respective sentencing curves for these scenarios.

Where the archetypal offender in the standard case is taken to have pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and hence demonstrated genuine remorse, the sentencing curve for the standard case should thus reflect such a discount. The magnitude of the discount given could <span class="font-italic">possibly</span> be in the range of a quarter to a third of what would have been an appropriate sentence (see <span class="font-italic">Fu Foo Tong v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [12]), but this estimate is by no means an entitlement or a strict rule. I have hence adjusted the sentencing guide for the standard case in Scenario 1 (denoted by the red dashed line) downwards to reflect this discount merely as a guide and no more, to make “room” for upward adjustments in situations falling under Scenario 1 with other aggravating factors present. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The sentencing curve for Situation 1 thus gradually tapers off at about 28 months after 500 kg on the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis.

The imprisonment term on the sentencing curve for Scenario 1 will <span class="font-italic">still increase</span> (albeit only marginally) with an increase in the quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes involved beyond 500 kg on the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis. The curve still inches up very gradually and at the extreme limits of the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis, it might well theoretically reach the statutory maximum imprisonment term of 36 months if an extremely huge quantity far in excess of 500 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes is involved. The point being made here is that where the quantity involved is so huge, it can theoretically become such an overriding consideration for sentencing that the court may justifiably not even give any discount for a remorseful plea of guilt from a first-time offender and impose the maximum punishment of 36 months. This would be consistent with the benchmark of “30–36” months’ imprisonment for “&gt; 400” kg of tobacco product in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> (see Table 2 above)<span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the other hand, the sentencing guide for Scenario 2 (marked by the black dashed line) gradually tapers off at 36 months after 500 kg on the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis due to the statutory maximum imprisonment term under s 128L(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Customs Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This sentencing framework should thus provide guidance for judges to consider the full range of imprisonment lengths (with the quantity of duty unpaid tobacco product involved as the key determinant) while deciding where in the range the conduct of a particular offender would fall.

All other factors being equal, youthfulness is a ground for extending leniency and applying a sentencing concession or discount to the benchmarks set out in either Scenario 1 or 2, both of which are premised on an offender not being a youthful offender. Here, the compassion should still be extended to the youthful offender based on the assumption that the young “don’t know any better” and may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others (<span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Ping Wuen Maurice</span> at [21]). I also note that the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) stipulates that nothing is an offence done by a child under 7 years of age, or by a child above 7 years of age and under 12 years of age who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion (see ss 82 and 83 of the Penal Code). In such cases, the discount on any benchmark sentence would essentially increase to 100% when the criminal acts of the child are deemed not to be an offence under the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 With this in mind, I set out the discount that may be applied to the benchmark sentence in Graph 3 in Table 3 below for typical Scenario 1 and 2 cases where the offender is a youthful offender who is to be sentenced to imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Table 3: Discount that may be applied for youthfulness</span></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Age of offender (at time of offence)</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Discount to benchmark sentence</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">21</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">20</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">5%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">19</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">15%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">18</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">25%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">17</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">35%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">16</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">45%</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the sentencing framework to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Reverting to the present case, the Respondent’s situation generally accords with the characteristics of an offender in Scenario 1 with the principal exception that he is a youthful offender: he is an untraced, first-time offender playing a relatively typical role in the smuggling operation as a paid worker to collect, deliver and unload duty unpaid cigarettes transported in a truck and he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. In this case, a very large quantity of 480 kg of uncustomed cigarettes was involved. With quantity as the primary factor, a benchmark sentence of around 28 months would be derived by reading off the sentencing curve for Scenario 1 on the <span class="font-italic">y</span>-axis for 480 kg on the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis (see Graph 3 above). Applying <span class="font-weight-bold">a discount of 15%</span> as the Respondent was 19 years old at the time of the offence (see Table 3 above) would then produce a benchmark sentence of about <span class="font-weight-bold">23.8 months</span>. The sentence imposed by the District Judge of <span class="font-weight-bold">15 months</span> falls well <span class="font-italic">below</span> the benchmark sentence derived of 23.8 months and in effect amounts to a huge <span class="font-weight-bold">46.4% discount</span> from the benchmark in Graph 3 for Scenario 1 merely on account of the Respondent’s youth. At 19 years old at the time of the offence, the Respondent is not exactly a very young offender to benefit from such an extensive discount from the benchmark. The District Judge was overly lenient. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Principle of sentencing parity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Prosecution argues that a proper application of the parity principle should see similar sentences meted out for both the Respondent and the co-accused.

In fact, the co-accused’s sentence of 24 months is <span class="font-italic">less</span> than what would be derived from the sentencing framework set out above, which would be about 26.6 months (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> 28 months read off the Scenario 1 curve on the <span class="font-italic">y</span>-axis at 480 kg on the <span class="font-italic">x</span>-axis, with a discount of 5% for his age at 20 years old).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 When co-offenders are involved in the same transaction with more or less the <span class="font-italic">same</span> degree of culpability after considering all the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors and are charged for the <span class="font-italic">same</span> offence, the principle of parity would generally apply. This principle was stated in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ramlee</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 95 at [7]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The parity principle has since been held to have a wider scope that this in <span class="font-italic">Lim Bee </span><span class="font-italic">Ngan Karen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1120 and<span class="font-italic"> Ng Sae </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the present case, I consider that the parity principle applies as between the Respondent and the co-accused as they are generally equally placed in terms of criminal culpability and the harm caused by their acts. In mitigation, the same personal mitigation factors were also cited (see Table 1). Thus, there ought not to be a glaring disparity in the sentences passed on the Respondent as compared to that imposed on the co-accused. The proper application of the parity principle is important in maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice: see Chan Sek Keong CJ’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“<span class="font-italic">UI</span>”) at [19]. Although I accept that the Respondent’s role was slightly greater than the co-accused as he had also collected and delivered in addition to unloading the duty unpaid tobacco at 10 Kaki Bukit Avenue 4, his slightly higher culpability would be offset by the further discount attributed to his youthfulness. The Respondent was a year younger than the co-accused at the time of the offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thus, I am of the view that the threshold for appellate intervention is met as the sentence below is manifestly inadequate (see <span class="font-italic">UI</span> at [12]–[13]).
