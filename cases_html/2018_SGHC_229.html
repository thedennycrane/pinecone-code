After mediation, their claim and counterclaim were compromised with a settlement agreement (“Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement envisaged final calculations to be effected by an independent accountant. Following an evaluation process that did not go smoothly, the appointed independent accountant issued a qualified opinion but set out a calculation according to the rubric provided by the Settlement Agreement. This calculation resulted in a sum owing from Mr Bajaj to Mr Ueda. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Mr Ueda followed on with letters asking Mr Bajaj to pay the sum calculated by the accountant, an additional sum specified by the Settlement Agreement and Mr Bajaj’s share of the accountant’s fees. These letters were ignored. Subsequently, Mr Ueda served a statutory demand on Mr Bajaj on 17 April 2018 (the “Statutory Demand”) claiming the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Mr Bajaj applied to set aside the Statutory Demand. On 13 July 2018, an Assistant Registrar dismissed Mr Bajaj’s application. On 30 July 2018, I dismissed Mr Bajaj’s appeal therefrom.

For tax and regulatory reasons, the parties conducted their business activities in Japan though TY Japan. TY Japan would provide sub-advisory services to Hachiman Cayman, the offshore fund management company. From 2009 to 2011, the parties managed the Hachiman Japan Fund from Singapore through Hachiman Singapore.

They entered into an agreement for how the assets of their business ought to be divided. Unfortunately, shortly after this agreement, there was a dispute over certain subsequent transactions and business decisions, as well as a dispute as to the precise nature and scope of their agreement. While these disputes were ongoing, Mr Bajaj resigned as a director of the TY Entities around March 2011, and also resigned as a director of the Hachiman Entities in May 2011, to enable him to take up a directorship in another fund management company.

Mr Bajaj claimed that he was overseas and did not receive Mr Akhtar’s email notification reminding the parties of the hearing. In his detailed description of the neutral evaluation process annexed to his Report, Mr Akhtar expressed doubt about the reasons provided by Mr Bajaj for his absence. The notification email was sent to Mr Bajaj’s usual email address and Mr Akhtar did not receive any notification of non-delivery. Mr Akhtar also noted that Mr Bajaj had previously agreed to the date.

Mr Bajaj also raised a new allegation: that Mr Ueda had wound up Hachiman Singapore without his consent, and may have sequestered around $150,000. Mr Bajaj used this allegation as further grounds for refusing to consent to any meeting between the parties, Mr Akhtar and the Mediator. Over the period of December 2016 to April 2017, the parties exchanged emails, but no progress was made. Mr Bajaj continued to demand the outstanding documents and allege impropriety in the winding up of Hachiman Singapore. Mr Ueda rebutted Mr Bajaj’s allegations while acknowledging that Mr Bajaj was free to present his allegations in an appropriate forum.

Mr Ueda disagreed, as he “[did] not consider that parties will realistically make any headway by returning to mediation after such extended correspondence on various issues and having explored the various approaches suggested by [Mr Akhtar] …”.

Nevertheless, Mr Akhtar requested a response from Mr Ueda on the allegation pertaining to the funds left in the accounts of the TY Entities. Mr Ueda’s reply was that any issue pertaining to the accounts of the TY Entities was entirely irrelevant to the NAV of Hachiman Cayman, since TY Cayman was neither a parent company nor a subsidiary of Hachiman Cayman. In his opinion, it was outside of the scope of Mr Akhtar’s remit. Mr Ueda reiterated his position that Mr Bajaj ought to pursue his allegations in a separate action if he wished to do so.

In <span class="font-italic">WBG Network</span>, the appellant in the court below had attempted to adduce evidence in the form of a letter containing three attachments. This was done in the context of an appeal from a summary judgment application. The letter was not produced in the form of an affidavit and instead was handed to the judge below by counsel at the hearing before the judge. The judge refused to admit the evidence (see <span class="font-italic">WBG Network </span>at [4]). The question before the Court of Appeal was whether the judge was entitled to do so. The Court of Appeal stated (at [5]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are of the opinion that, based on the improper manner the evidence was adduced, the court would have been entitled to reject the documents. Documents do not amount to evidence unless they have been properly adduced and admitted into evidence by the court. Accordingly, the person adducing the evidence must do so on oath or affirmation as well as be subject to cross-examination, if necessary, so as to ascertain the relevance or authenticity of the evidence that is sought to be admitted. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 <span class="font-italic">WBG Network</span> illustrates that the rules relating to the adducing of evidence are not premised on mere rigid adherence to technicality but are necessitated by the proper administration of justice. Where evidence is not adduced by affidavit and merely appended to written submissions or handed to the judge on the day of the hearing, it deprives the opposing counsel the opportunity to properly obtain instructions to make further comment on the evidence adduced. The opposing party, properly advised, may choose to reply by affidavit. The requirements of O 38 r 2(2) of the ROC provide further a safeguard as to the relevance and authenticity of the documents appended to an affidavit, by providing the option of cross-examining the party who affirms the affidavit. This is crucial because relevance, authenticity and reasons for late adduction are key in a decision whether to admit such evidence upon a Registrar’s Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I therefore disregarded the two annexes. Somewhat surprisingly, despite counsel for Mr Ueda’s objections, counsel for Mr Bajaj did not make any application – not even an oral one – to introduce the new evidence. Instead, the two annexes were appended to Mr Bajaj’s written submissions and referred to in the body of the submissions as if they were already in evidence within the affidavits. Such conduct ought to be discouraged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Service of notice of appeal out of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On 13 July 2018, the unsealed notice of appeal was sent by Mr Bajaj’s solicitors to Mr Ueda’s solicitors.

Order 3 r 2(5) provides that where the period of time specified is seven days or less, days other than working days “shall be excluded”.

In my view, Mr Bajaj required an extension of the time frame beyond seven days in order to correct the procedural irregularity in service. <span class="font-italic">Black’s Law Dictionary</span> (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2014) at p 8 defines “abridgment” as “the reduction or diminution of something concrete (as a treatise) or abstract (as a legal right)”. Put in context, this was the shortening of the applicable time frame provided by law. Despite his insistence that the proper application was for an abridgment of time, in the interests of justice, I nevertheless considered the application on the basis of a request for an extension of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another suit</span> [2008] 1 SLR (R) 757 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong</span>”) at [18]–[28] has confirmed that the four factors of (a) the length of the delay, (b) the reasons for the delay, (c) the chances of succeeding on appeal and, (d) the degree of prejudice, are the factors to be considered when deciding an application to extend time to serve a notice of appeal. These four factors are of equal importance and must be taken into account and balanced amongst one another having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case concerned; although, in considering the merits of appeal, the threshold is a low one (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong</span> at [19] and [28]). With regard to the factors of the length and reason for delay, the court also noted, at [21], that “it would generally be the case that an extremely short delay might be excused without the need for the court to inquire at length into the reasons for that delay”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Counsel for Mr Ueda focused his objection to the extension of time on the factor of “reason for delay”. He highlighted that counsel for Mr Bajaj was responsible for the delay in serving the notice of appeal and hence Mr Bajaj could not be granted an extension of time. He cited two cases to support his position: the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Ooi Chew Seng v Ultratech Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</span> [1997] 2 MLJ 344 (“<span class="font-italic">Ooi Chew Seng</span>”) as well as the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd (</span><span class="font-italic">trading as Stansfield School of Business) v Vithya Sri Sumathis</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 927 (“<span class="font-italic">Stansfield Business</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I did not think either case went far enough to support Mr Ueda’s position. <span class="font-italic">Ooi Chew Seng</span> merely confirms that service of an unsealed notice of appeal is invalid service (see <span class="font-italic">Ooi Chew Seng </span>at 349–350). This was not in dispute. As for <span class="font-italic">Stansfield Business</span>, while the case appears to suggest that a default on the part of the solicitors may disentitle a party from receiving an extension of time from the Court (see <span class="font-italic">Stansfield Business at </span>[33]), the Court of Appeal clarified in the later decision of <span class="font-italic">Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical Investments Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR (R) 926 (<span class="font-italic">“Nomura</span>”), that “there is no absolute rule of law which prescribes that an error on the part of a solicitor or his staff can never, under any circumstances be a sufficient ground” (at [28]). In <span class="font-italic">Nomura</span>, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the judge, who granted the extension on the basis that the delay was not prolonged, the solicitors were not tardy in pursuing the appeal, the mistake was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, the appeal was not utterly hopeless and there was no prejudice to the appellant (see <span class="font-italic">Nomura</span> at [34]–[35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the present case, there was a delay of only one day. There was also no prejudice occasioned by the mistake of Mr Bajaj’s solicitors. Mr Ueda was aware of the appeal. His solicitors received the unsealed copy of the notice of appeal on 13 July 2018 when it was filed, and solicitors for Mr Bajaj followed on to apply for a <span class="font-italic">qu</span><span class="font-italic">ia timet</span> injunction to restrain a bankruptcy application by Mr Ueda in order to prevent Mr Bajaj’s appeal from being rendered nugatory. The date for the Registrar’s Appeal was also made clear during the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing of the <span class="font-italic">quia timet</span> injunction before a duty senior judge on 17 July 2018.

</div> The issues raised in the appeal, on the low threshold envisaged by <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong</span>, merited consideration.

In this context, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohd Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 446 (“<span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span>”) has emphasised at [30] that a mere assertion of a triable issue is insufficient, :</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court must examine <span class="font-italic">all the facts</span> to ascertain whether the “genuine triable issue” test in para 144 of the Practice Directions is satisfied. The upshot of this is that the court will only set aside a statutory demand (and thereby require a creditor to initiate a civil suit if he wishes to pursue the claimed debt further) where the debtor is able to adduce evidence on affidavit that raises a triable issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In this case, Mr Bajaj argued that, as envisaged in rr 98(2)(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Rules, the debts in the Statutory Demand were substantially disputed by the plaintiff, or alternatively, that Mr Bajaj had a valid counterclaim, set-off or cross claim that exceeded the value of the demanded sums.

</div>
</div>  In the hearing before me, he relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee v Resource Credit Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 5 SLR 402 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee</span>”) to suggest that if there was a question on law before the court, the court exercising its bankruptcy jurisdiction would be compelled to set-aside the statutory demand and let the matter be decided at a court exercising civil jurisdiction at trial. Several of the issues identified above (at [51]) required the court to consider the legal effect of the words of the Settlement Agreement. Counsel for Mr Bajaj argued that because the legal effect of the words of the Settlement Agreement was disputed by parties, there was a genuine triable issue and the Statutory Demand had to be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It was not disputed that it is not the function of a bankruptcy court to conduct a full hearing of the dispute and adjudicate on the merits of the creditor’s claim (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong v ABN-AMRO Bank NV </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 31<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [3]). Nevertheless, the mere fact that a question of law has been raised by the debtor cannot and should not automatically result in the setting aside of the Statutory Demand. In <span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee</span> the court set aside a statutory demand that was served by a licensed moneylender on a borrower on the grounds that there was a substantial dispute over the debt (<span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee </span>at [72]). A key issue before the court was whether the licensed moneylender had infringed certain provisions of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”) by imposing a 10% administrative fee for every loan refinancing arrangement (<span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee </span>at [36]–[38]). This was an issue that involved the interpretation of the Act in question. Instead of immediately declaring that there was a genuine triable issue, and deferring the matter to trial, the court embarked on an examination of the applicable provisions of the Act and the applicable subsidiary legislation and even discussed the parliamentary intent behind the enactment of certain provisions (<span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee </span>at [39]–[40], [49]–[53]). It was only after the court determined the legal effect of the MLA that the court turned to examine the facts and conclude that there were triable issues. (<span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee </span>at [54]). From this reading of <span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee</span>, it is clear that even a court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction may legitimately determine questions of law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This approach is consistent with the guidance of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>where it was emphasised that the affidavits must reveal a genuine issue for trial: see above, at [49]. An issue before the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco </span>was whether it was possible for a court to grant a conditional stay of bankruptcy proceedings. The Court of Appeal held that it was appropriate to extend the analogy of a summary judgment application to the imposition of conditions for granting a stay of bankruptcy proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span> at [18]). The court at [22] highlighted that to hold otherwise would entail several difficulties:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 If a bankruptcy court were unwilling to grant a conditional stay of bankruptcy proceedings and were to dismiss outright a bankruptcy application on the strength of a shadowy case, the creditor would necessarily have to safeguard his interest in different proceedings. This would involve his filing a writ and statement of claim and making a summary judgment application, whereupon the same issues that were canvassed before the bankruptcy court would have to be rehearsed in detail. This could involve the same waste of resources that justifies the extension of summary judgment principles to the insolvency context in the first place (see [17] above). Worse still, it could unfairly prejudice the interests of the creditor as he faces the risk of the debtor using the delay to dissipate his assets. <span class="font-italic">The court should therefore be astute to avoid taking an overly formalistic approach in exercising its jurisdiction: </span><span class="font-italic">matters that a bankruptcy court can determine as well as a civil court should be resolved to the fullest extent possible at the first opportunity.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>After all, in Singapore, the bankruptcy court is the same court as the civil court, albeit exercising a different jurisdiction. [Emphasis added]     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, these concerns are equally pertinent in the context of setting aside a statutory demand. A creditor ought not to be put to unnecessary expense. If, after being made to commence a writ action, a creditor could obtain summary judgment on that writ action, he would have been put to wasted costs. The same rationale undergirds the remedy of summary judgment and the setting aside of statutory demands. If the interposition of a trial would add nothing to the information already available to the court to make a determination on a question of law, doing so would increase costs to no efficacious purpose, entail a waste of judicial resources and cause undue delay which would result in unfair prejudice to the creditor who has been kept waiting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Therefore, to the extent that there were questions of law in relation to determining the legal effect of the words of the Settlement Agreement, I dealt with these in the manner explained below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Settlement Amount under Clause 3</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I have given a detailed account of the evaluation process in the background section, because Mr Bajaj made many contentions which may be distilled as follows. First, Mr Ueda’s non-compliance with his Clause 8 disclosure obligation disallows him the fruits of his conduct, the Settlement Amount. Second, because the independent accountant’s report is qualified, the Settlement Amount is not binding on parties as envisaged in Clause 9 of the Settlement Agreement. And third, in these circumstances, the only course is to return to mediation as provided by Clause 16 of the Settlement Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Has Mr Ueda breached his obligations?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It was not disputed that the NAV of Hachiman Cayman in 2010 and 2011 were components of Table X and Y.

Mr Ueda was only obliged to take all necessary steps to procure documents for the purposes of Clause 1.

It is significant to note that both Clause 8 and the Underlying Documents Footnote were limited in scope to documents relevant for the purpose of calculating and populating Tables X and Y. Mr Akhtar was satisfied, as early as in 13 October 2015, that the documents made available were sufficient to populate Tables X and Y (see [15] above).

</div> This check was important because the request for the CNB and Kaneyama documents related to Mr Bajaj’s allegations about a loan made to TY Japan that was subsequently recorded by Tricor as returned to a Tricor trust account. There is no merit in any of Mr Bajaj’s contentions about the loan. Tricor is an independent third party against whom Mr Bajaj has made no allegations. Neither is there any merit in his allegations about missing proceeds from the liquidation of the TY entities, which was furnished as the reason for the request for the Kaneyama documents. Mr Bajaj was an equal shareholder and would receive half of those proceeds in liquidation; if not, his recourse would be with the liquidators. Mr Bajaj raised these last disclosure requests simply to stall completion of the process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ duty to cooperate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this context, it is useful to deal with the duty to cooperate reposed on parties. Mr Bajaj raised the argument that Mr Ueda had breached his implied duty to cooperate. In my view, it was Mr Bajaj who was remiss in cooperating. I deal with it here as it is relevant to how Clauses 9 and 16 should be dealt with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 <span class="font-italic">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR (R) 634 (“<span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span>”) formed the premise of Mr Bajaj’s argument on this point. There, a main contractor and a sub-contractor were in a dispute over delayed construction works and agreed to a consent order, referring all pending claims to an Independent Assessor from the construction industry who would assess the respective claims as an expert rather than an arbitrator. The Independent Assessor held a first meeting with both parties, where various timelines regarding filing of claim papers, exchange of documents, payment of fees and hearing dates were unequivocally agreed to. The main contractor complied with the timeline for filing claim papers but disregarded every other timeline. It also did not pay for its share of the Independent Assessor’s fees, which was a breach of the consent order. For the next few months, the main contractor continued to disregard a whole host of directives and attempts from the Independent Assessor to engage the main contractor, despite warnings from the Independent Assessor that an award would be issued on the basis of the evidence as submitted by the sub-contractor if the main contractor did not comply with the orders and attend the meetings/hearings as agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Independent Assessor, in his award, struck out the main contractor’s claim and defence to the sub-contractor’s counterclaim and awarded a sum of slightly over $350,000 to the sub-contractor. On an application to set the award aside, V K Rajah J (as he then was), found that the main contractor “was to all intents and purposes completely uninterested and unconcerned about the assessment procedure and/or outcome” and in “contumacious disregard” of the directions of the Independent Assessor (see <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span> at [13] and [15]). Rajah J held, at [29], that in the absence of fraud or any corrupt colouring of the Independent Assessor’s determination, there were no grounds to reopen the merits of the case, in light of the contractual bargain of the parties to have their case finally and irrevocably determined by an expert. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Rajah J, at [48]–[51], was of the view that parties must be assumed to intend the performance of a contract they agree to, and an implied duty to co-operate arose therefrom. Because the main contractor had repudiated its obligation, the subcontractor should be absolved from the consequences of the main contractor’s conduct. The wider principle at play was that a party in default under a contract cannot take advantage of its own breach to gain a benefit or evade his contractual obligations. Rajah J stated at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 In order to invoke this principle it must be shown that the contractual right or benefit that a party is asserting or claiming is a direct result of that party’s prior breach of contract. The relevant breach, the factual consequences flowing from the breach and the advantage the contract breaker is seeking to raise must be identified. The principle seeks to prevent the contract breaker from seeking an “advantage” arising from his default…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, the main contractor was not entitled to take advantage of the alleged breach of the terms of reference, which was caused by the main contractor’s failure to co-operate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I would highlight that in the present case, the duty to cooperate is express, and not merely implied. Clause 15 provides that “parties undertake to take all reasonable endeavours” to give effect to the Settlement Agreement. Mr Bajaj’s behaviour over the course of this dispute is squarely a breach of his duty to cooperate. As set out at [10]–[30] above, Mr Bajaj embarked on a course of conduct that was completely antithetical to the smooth functioning of the neutral evaluation process. He did not show up for pre-arranged hearings, was tardy and unresponsive in his replies and gave dubious excuses for his absences. It was only after the threat of an opinion being issued in his absence that he sprang into action, making spurious allegations alleging bias on the part of Mr Akhtar.

</div> Mr Akhtar’s efforts to placate Mr Bajaj resulted in the dispute dragging on until November 2016. A proposal for a meeting with the Mediator at this point was rejected by Mr Bajaj, and he insisted on the receipt of the CNB and Kaneyama Documents before proceeding further; he also raised another new allegation which had no bearing on Tables X and Y.

</div> Even then, no contact appeared to have been made with the Mediator. It appeared to me that Mr Bajaj’s actions were calculated to drag out the proceedings for as long as possible, rather than to seek a prompt resolution of the dispute pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The delay of more than two years was caused by Mr Bajaj’s disregard for agreed hearing dates, failure to answer emails, a demand for Mr Akhtar to recuse himself on grounds of bias, and then, as a last resort, a demand for documents with peripheral relevance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 If Mr Bajaj had promptly raised all his concerns at the proper time when the documents were supplied in February 2015 or at the agreed clarification date of 2 April 2015, it would have been easier to fault Mr Ueda for not doing more to provide the documents that Mr Bajaj desired. Mr Bajaj well knew that the passage of time would have had an impact on the ease of procuring the documents sought; their plan was to wind up their joint business which necessitated closure of accounts and liquidation of companies. His insistence on these documents, when he knew they were not within Mr Ueda’s power, control or possession, resulted in the qualification of Mr Akhtar’s Report.

This cannot be the case. Clause 16 must be subject to a standard of reasonableness, made express in Clause 15, which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.

</div> I deal therefore only with the assertions of fraud in this section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In my view, there was no basis for the contentions of fraud. Of relevance was the fact that all the documents relied on by counsel for Mr Bajaj in making this submission were located in the two annexes to his written submissions which, as I mention at [39], I did not admit into evidence. Counsel orally informed the court that the documents were obtained from the case statement folio tendered by Mr Ueda in early 2015. If this were so, it was inexplicable that a valid cross claim would be raised by way of annex to appellate submissions more than three years later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The court was thus left with unsubstantiated assertions made in Mr Bajaj’s affidavits. As highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span> (which I detail at [49] above), mere assertions of fraud are insufficient to establish a genuine triable issue. Indeed the evidence that was before the court indicated quite the opposite. The Report makes clear that Mr Akhtar had, in the course of his neutral evaluation, investigated the claim that the Hachiman Loan was not repaid. After reviewing the documents available at Tricor’s offices, Mr Akhtar was satisfied with the manner in which the Hachiman Loan was dealt with.

</div> Mr Bajaj stated that: “it has never been my intention to challenge the work product of Tricor … However, my position has consistently been that Tricor’s ability to generate a true and complete account of Hachiman Cayman, would be dependent on it being given access to the full set of Source Documents by [Mr Bajaj]…”.

</div> This assertion lacks premise: as the Tricor trust account was maintained by Tricor, there was no need to rely on external documents from Mr Ueda to track monies flowing into the Tricor trust account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I accordingly found that there was no genuine triable issue in relation to any of the cross claims contended. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether it was appropriate to grant a conditional setting aside of the statutory demand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Counsel for Mr Bajaj suggested that if the court was not minded to set aside the Statutory Demand, the court ought to grant a conditional setting aside of the Statutory Demand. Such a stay was granted and upheld by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>The case involved guarantors of a loan and the creditor, Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Chimbusco”). Chimbusco had issued a call on the guarantees, but the guarantors ignored the call and the subsequent statutory demands. The guarantors resisted bankruptcy proceedings on the basis of an allegation that there were oral representations that the guarantees were meant to be mere formalities and not binding on the parties. The judge below granted a conditional stay of bankruptcy proceedings as he found triable issues, albeit shadowy in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I accept that in principle, the court can grant a conditional setting aside of a statutory demand. The circumstances in the present case were, however, markedly different from that of <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span>. The High Court, with whom the Court of Appeal agreed, found that the dispute was incapable of resolution through affidavit evidence alone, given the equivocal documentary evidence, and the fact that the allegations pertained to oral representations made. I did not have the same difficulty in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Mr Ueda and Mr Bajaj signed their Settlement Agreement on 19 August 2014. Their Neutral Evaluation Agreement, concluded on 14 November 2014, specified a documents-only evaluation by an independent accountant. One would have expected the calculation to be derived from two tables to have been a simple exercise for an expert. Mr Bajaj’s conduct resulted in in a protracted process and a delayed Report, which was finally released to parties in March 2018 after Mr Ueda paid for Mr Bajaj’s share of the fees. In the same manner that he has delayed each step of the implementation of the Settlement Agreement, Mr Bajaj has continued to delay the enforcement of sums owing under it, which form the basis of the Statutory Demand he sought to set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In my judgment, there was no substantial dispute on the debts stated in the Statutory Demand nor was there a valid cross claim or counterclaim. I accordingly dismissed the Registrar’s Appeal. Costs, after hearing parties, were awarded to the defendant and fixed at $5,000 (inclusive of disbursements). </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Shaun Lee and Pravin Shanmugaraj Thevar (Bird &amp; Bird ATMD LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Jeremy Leong and Mohamed Najib (Acton Law LLC) for the defendant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
