<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font face="Univers" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>        On 20 November 2001 I

granted leave to the Liquidators ("BFS Liquidators") of Baring Futures

(Singapore) Pte Limited (in Liquidation) ("BFS") to convene a creditors’

meeting to agree, with or without modification, a scheme of arrangement as detailed in the

document described as "Proposals in Relation to A Scheme of Arrangement Under Section

210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50)" which is hereinafter referred to as "the

Singapore Scheme". This was one of the predecessor steps which the BFS Liquidators,

as required, had taken as they intended to make as soon as practicable interim dividend

payments to certain creditors of BFS after having satisfied themselves that they had in

place the provisions of funding (which I shall in a moment describe in greater detail)

sufficient to pay for and, in addition, meet any adverse costs orders, whether on the

standard or indemnity basis, which may be incurred by or made against BFS in its trimmed

down action ("Auditors action") against Deloitte &amp; Touche Singapore

("D&amp;T Singapore"). The Auditors action is shortly to continue before Justice

Evans-Lombe in London, UK. It was envisaged that if the proposed Singapore Scheme was

approved in all material respects at the creditors’ meeting I would resume hearing on

the eve of the New Legal Year 2002 to sanction the Singapore Scheme. 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 A meeting of creditors of BFS was duly convened on 6 December 2001. A

representative of D&amp;T Singapore attended the meeting. He informed the chairman and

those present that D&amp;T intended to appeal against the BFS Liquidators’ rejection

of D&amp;T Singapore’s indemnity costs claim as well as their contribution claims

against BFS which they had asserted against BFS in the Auditors action. The extent of the

indemnity costs of D&amp;T was stated to be S$42,459,135.57. The amount was the value

which was attributed to D&amp;T Singapore’s vote. D&amp;T Singapore’s

contribution claim was regarded as not a provable debt in liquidation because BFS’s

contribution claim, an unliquidated claim in tort, was not specified in D&amp;T

Singapore’s first Proof of Debt. However, there was an indication in the first Proof

of Debt that the total debt due was approximately S$3.86 billion. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The Singapore Scheme was duly approved by a majority in number

representing three-fourths in value of the creditors present and voting either in person

or by proxy. D&amp;T Singapore’s proxy voted but on a without prejudice basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 On 7 December 2001 D&amp;T Singapore filed the second Proof of Debt.

In an annexure to the prescribed Proof of Debt Form, they stated that they were appointed

auditors of BFS in or about October 1986 and remained as auditors of BSF until about July

1994. In particular, they were the auditors of BFS’s financial statements for the

financial year ended 30 September 1992 and for the 15 month period ended 31 December 1993.

They further asserted that, among other terms, under their appointment, the terms of which

incorporated the Articles of Association of BFS, they are entitled to an indemnity out of

the assets of BFS against all losses or liabilities which they may have incurred in the

execution of the duties of their office as auditors.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 Article 110 provides as follows: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Every Director or other officer of the Company shall be entitled

  to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all losses or liabilities

  (including any such liability as is mentioned in the Act), which he may sustain or incur

  in or about the execution of the duties of his office or otherwise in relation thereto,

  and no such Director or other officer shall be liable for any loss, damage or misfortune

  which may happen to or be incurred by the Company in the execution of the duties of his

  office or in relation thereto. But this Article shall only have effect in so far as its

  provisions are not avoided by the Act." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 D&amp;T Singapore submitted that any such contractual claim for costs

will also be a claim in respect of which they are entitled to be paid in full, in priority

to other creditors and in priority to costs and expenses incurred in the liquidation

(other than those incurred in getting in, maintaining and realizing the assets).

Alternatively, they claim priority as an expense of the liquidation in priority to other

creditors. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 As the BFS Liqudators joined issues with these submissions, I also

had before me two motions filed under the winding up petition. Under one motion, D&amp;T

Singapore are seeking an order that the decisions of the BFS Liquidators in rejecting the

two Proofs of Debts filed in November and December last year be reversed and the further

order that they be admitted in full. As noted earlier, D&amp;T Singapore relied on the

contractual indemnity under Article 110 and they asserted that the liabilities they

incurred were in respect of costs of defending proceedings brought by Baring PLC

("PLC") and Bishopscourt (BS) Limited ("BSL") in the High Court of

England, Chancery Division and by the Singapore Public Accountancy Board

("PAB"). D&amp;T Singapore observed that judgment was given in their favour in

both cases, although the BFS Liquidators contended that, in the absence of full disclosure

of the PAB proceedings, it must be inferred that on the totality of the evidence there was

evidence that the PAB had found D&amp;T Singapore negligent, though not grossly negligent,

which was probably the reason why they were found not guilty of any professional

negligence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 I return to the Singapore Scheme for which sanction is sought from

me. BFS Liquidators had also sued Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Singapore for damages for

negligence. That action was settled. The settlement arrived at by all interested parties

contemplated making an interim distribution to the creditors of BFS, PLC and BSL mainly

from the payment of 65 million by Coopers &amp; Lybrand firms and from the existing

assets of BFS, PLC and BSL. To continue to fund the litigation against D&amp;T Singapore

the creditors have agreed to put in place 2 escrow accounts from which monies can be drawn

by BFS, PLC and BSL. They are described as the Litigation Escrow Account and the Costs

Escrow Account. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 For D&amp;T Singapore, counsel postulated to me for consideration

this scenario. If the trial judge in the Auditors action in London exercises his

discretion to award D&amp;T Singapore its costs against BFS on the standard basis, and on

the assumption that Singapore courts finally determine that D&amp;T Singapore as auditors

are entitled to an indemnity under Article 110, counsel pointed out that the difference

between the costs as awarded by the trial judge in the Auditors action and the full amount

of costs they will have incurred would be "in excess of 5 million". I was told

that this figure is based on the assumptions that standard basis costs will be recovered

at the rate of 75% of the gross costs and that under the indemnity D&amp;T Singapore will

recover 90% of its gross costs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 It should be noted that there were canvassed before me conflicting

submissions of both parties in relation to the contractual claim of D&amp;T Singapore

under Article 110. The BFS Liquidators adopted a root and branch counter-attack. They

asserted, in the first place, that Article 110 was not even incorporated into the contract

of engagement between D&amp;T Singapore and BFS. Secondly, as a matter of strict

construction, they contended that Article 110 did not entitle D&amp;T Singapore to an

indemnity in respect of its costs of the Auditors Action or the PAB proceedings. The

principal submissions were (i) that those costs were not "losses or liabilities

sustained or incurred in or about the execution of (their) duties to the company or

otherwise in relation thereto"; and (ii) that it was on the evidence never intended

by the parties that Article 110 would provide an indemnity for such costs. In support of

the first named principal submission, they relied on the dicta of Rix J. (as he then was)

in <i>Rowland &amp; Ors v Gulfpac Limited</i> [1999] Lloyd’s Rep. Bank 86, at 93col.

1 where he stated: "But costs incurred as an expense, …., or in England as part

of the directors’ own English proceedings, are costs incurred in defending or

prosecuting actions and are not, it seems to me, costs incurred or sustained in or about

the execution of a director’s duties to Gulpac or otherwise in relation

thereto." On the other hand, counsel for D&amp;T Singapore, especially in their

supplemental submissions, countered with some force that the words were clear and apt to

confer an indemnity for D&amp;T Singapore costs if they successfully defend against the

claims for negligence, which is in line with the indemnity permitted under section 172(2)

of the Companies Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 In relation to the treatment of the contractual claim of D&amp;T

Singapore as a matter of priority in the distribution out of the assets of the company,

counsel for D&amp;T Singapore asserted that the contractual claim would fall within the

principle of the estate costs rule as set out in <i>In re Pacific Coast Syndicate, Ltd</i>

[1913] 2 Ch 26 which was recently followed without discussion by the House of Lords in <i>Norglen

v Reeds Raines Prudential</i> [1999] 2 AC 1, per Lord Hoffmann at p.20. Alternatively, and

in any event, they submitted that the contractual claim would rank as an expense of the

liquidation. They pointed to the "critical feature" of the claim which was that

the Auditors action was commenced by the BFS Liquidators after BFS was in liquidation.

They relied on the reasoning of Nicholls LJ (as he then was) in <i>Re Atlantic Computer

Systems plc</i> [1992] Ch 505 at p 522 where he reasoned that in a case where a debt had

been incurred for the benefit of the insolvent estate "it is just and equitable that

the burden of the debt should be borne by those for whose benefit they insolvent estate is

being administered."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 For the reasons which follow shortly, I have decided in the exercise

of my discretion to defer determination of the indemnity and the super-priority or,

alternatively, the expense claims of D&amp;T Singapore until three events have come to

past: viz, (1) BFS’s claims against D&amp;T have been settled, or where a final

non-appealable judgment on D&amp;T Singapore’s liability has been entered; (2) actual

liability of BFS to D&amp;T Singapore in respect of the costs of the BFS action has been

finally determined; AND (3) the Costs Escrow Account of 26 million has been exhausted

and proven insufficient to meet the actual costs claims (whether decided on a standard or

indemnity basis) of D&amp;T Singapore. In the circumstances of this case, I feel

uncomfortable exercising my discretion and granting reliefs where there are a number of

contingencies and where the taxed costs may be significantly below the funding already in

place. The appeals of D&amp;T Singapore against the rejection of their two Proofs of Debt

are also in consequence deferred for determination until after the abovementioned issues

in relation to the alleged indemnity has been made. They are inextricably intertwined.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 The first of these reasons has to do with an analysis of the

figures. The following conclusions seem to me justified. If the settlement is implemented,

the amount of provision for D&amp;T Singapore’s costs is 26 million. As at 5

November 2001, D&amp;T Singapore’s alleged estimated costs until end of trial are

approximately 28.5 million and interest. As of that date, they would have spent 22

million and they are incurring costs at the rate of 1 million a month. At this present

burn rate, D&amp;T Singapore will only hit 26 million at the end of February 2002. As of

today, I am confident that until the end of February 2002 BFS still has sufficient cover

to continue litigation against D&amp;T Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 The Vice-Chancellor Sir Andrew Morrit, Head of the Chancery Division

of the Royal Courts of Justice had recently overruled D&amp;T’s objections and

allowed interim distribution. The reason was, inter alia, the amount of costs claimed by

D&amp;T Singapore will probably be taxed down anyway. The Vice-Chancellor described the

costs of the litigation estimated by D&amp;T Singapore as of "quite astonishing

size’ and the London Liquidators of PLC and BSL had provided "compelling

criticism of the amount of [D&amp;T Singapore’s] costs and strong reasons for

believing that the amount claimed will not be recovered to anything like that extent on a

detailed assessment.". I also respectfully adopt the other material reasons of the

Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 I accordingly sanction the Singapore Scheme as approved by the

requisite majority in value of the creditors. With the implementation of the settlement,

the estate will be allowed to be capitalized so that the BFS Liquidators have access to

the Costs and Litigation Escrow Accounts and can continue litigation until the point is

reached where the liquidators are of the view that there would be insufficient funding to

cover D&amp;T Singapore’s costs and therefore have to consider terminating the BFS

action against D&amp;T Singapore and paying them the inevitable costs award or when BFS

gets further funding from its creditors before continuing the said action. Last but not

least, and as the Vice-Chancellor had pointed out in his judgment, D&amp;T Singapore have

alternative routes to secure or provide for its costs even if the scheme is approved. I

have no reason to doubt that such alternative routes are available if the costs estimates

of D&amp;T Singapore are shown to be meritorious in London.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 Near the end of the hearing on 7 January 2002, counsel for the BFS

Liquidators informed of the matters set out in the submissions and applied pursuant to

section 272(1)(d) of the Companies Act for sanction of the 7 netting off Deeds on

contribution liability and costs incurred in relation to the contributing proceedings. I

have considered the draft order which I now approve. Counsel for both parties are directed

to settle the draft orders in accordance with my rulings herein and submit them to me for

approval as soon as practicable.</p>
