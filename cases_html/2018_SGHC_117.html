</div> To effect the plan, the Accused would approach V to ask her why she claimed to be the “Teck Whye <span class="font-italic">dajie</span>” (big sister of Teck Whye). Fu would then step in and pretend to protect V from the Accused. The Accused agreed to help Fu carry out his plan. Hence, Fu brought V to meet the Accused at the Yew Tee NTUC Foodfare, but when they arrived, the Accused noticed that V was “giving [Fu] attitude” and “staring” at Fu. Fu then told the Accused that he wanted to speak to V alone, and Fu and V left the Accused at the Yew Tee NTUC Foodfare. About half an hour later, Fu returned with V to meet the Accused at the Yew Tee NTUC Foodfare. The Accused did not know where Fu had gone, but later that day, Fu sent him Photo P20 and two other photographs of Fu and V taken on the same occasion as Photo P20 (as found in the photo collage). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>The Accused admitted that he had prepared the photo collage and in July 2014 asked Popo to upload it, as he wanted to shame Fu who had implicated him in a rioting case.

Where no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration (see <span class="font-italic">AOF v P</span><span class="font-italic">P</span> [2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]). A complainant’s testimony would be considered unusually convincing if the testimony “when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused”. The “relevant considerations in determining whether a witness is unusually convincing are his or her demeanour and the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’ testimony” (<span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v </span><span class="font-italic">PP and other appeals</span> [2016] 5 SLR 636 (“<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>”) at [28], citing <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v</span> <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton</span><span class="font-italic"> Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton</span>”) at [39] and <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [115]). The requirement that the complainant’s evidence should be “unusually convincing” does not change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but it sets the threshold for preferring the complainant’s testimony over the accused’s evidence where there is no other evidence and it boils down to one person’s word against another’s (<span class="font-italic">XP v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [31] and [34]). Where the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story (<span class="font-italic">Haliffie </span>at [30], citing <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>The approach to corroborative evidence is a “liberal” one. To determine whether a piece of evidence can amount to corroboration, the court looks at “the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate” (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton </span>at [43]). But such “liberal corroboration” is nevertheless subject to certain “inherent conceptual constraints” (<span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [175]). Under s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), former statements may corroborate later testimony as to the same fact but this is only if the former statements were made “at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>At the outset and from the parties’ submissions, there was no dispute by the Defence over the elements of the offences constituting each of the charges. The Accused’s defence was one of bare denial – Zona slapped V on the 1st occasion and he did not rape her; he never met V on the 2nd and 3rd Occasions; and he never went with V and Fu to a block of HDB flats on the 4th Occasion. Hence the incidents which are the subject-matter of the 2nd to 11th charges could not have taken place. As for the 12th charge, the Accused admitted to circulating Photo P19 to Fu.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">1st Occasion (1st charge)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>In relation to the 1st Occasion, V stated that whilst at Lot 2 around November or December 2013, the Accused confronted her to settle a conflict between her and XW. When he was alone with V at the staircase landing outside KBox, he pinned her down and raped her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>I found that the Prosecution had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the 1st charge. A reasonable doubt had been raised, as V’s evidence was not unusually convincing and there were some external inconsistencies. First, V stated that the confrontation (and the rape) occurred when she and the Accused were alone. However, there was evidence to suggest that this might not have been the case. Fu testified that Zona had informed him that she had been present at the confrontation and had slapped V.

</div> The point here is not whether Zona had indeed been there and slapped V, but that Fu recounted that Zona had told him as such. Second, V did not inform anyone about this incident until after Photo P20 was circulated in July 2014. In fact, before V made the Second Report, she did not even inform Fu of this incident, despite having informed him of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Occasions.

</div> I accept that a rape victim may be hesitant to make a report, and V explained that she did not want to be thought of as “loose” and that it was embarrassing, but this did not explain why she was forthcoming with Fu about the other three Occasions but not the 1st Occasion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>In the final analysis, whether the 1st Occasion occurred was based on V’s sole and uncorroborated account. Whilst there might be cogent reasons why V did not inform anyone about the 1st Occasion until after she made the Second Report, the lack of contemporaneous or early reporting of the 1st Occasion, coupled with the absence of supporting evidence, reduced the strength of her testimony. As such, I found it unsafe to prefer V’s account over the Accused’s account and to convict the Accused on the 1st charge.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">2nd Occasion (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th charges)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>As for the 2nd Occasion, V stated that Ng and Kim had approached her at Lot 1 to smoke and they proceeded to Lot 2.

He then forced her to perform oral sex on him before he raped her and took Photo P19. The Accused’s defence was that he was never alone with V on any occasion anywhere,

Even if Darius could not categorically confirm who had taken the photo, the fact remained that if anyone had sent the photo to the Accused (as he claimed), it would have appeared in his hand phone as a received item.

Mr Choh (in Fu’s cross-examination) asserted that the Accused had shown Fu Photo P19 when they were playing LAN games, and the Accused had admitted that he shown Photo P19 to Fu and sent the photo to Fu.

</div> In my judgment, this was inconclusive and no reliable inferences could be drawn from a comparison of Photo P19 with the photographs taken of the staircase beside KBox (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, exhibit P17). The colour of the background wall as seen in Photo P19 was not a reliable indication of the true colour of that wall, and nothing helpful could be deduced from it. A perusal of Photo P19 would show that the background colour had various shades and was “grainy” – this could be due to the quality of the photograph image.

The forensic examination of the Accused’s hand phone pointed to him having taken Photo P19, and this was corroborated by Fu’s and Ng’s accounts that he had told them the same. Fu also stated that the Accused had informed him that he had threatened and raped V on the occasion he had taken Photo P19, and Ng had also testified that the Accused had boasted to him about having sex with V. Having found that Photo P19 was taken by the Accused, I had no reason to doubt V’s account that it was so taken after she was raped by him, and it was clear that Photo P19 was taken without V’s consent. Hence, on the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th charges had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3rd Occasion (6th and 7th charges)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>Coming to the 3rd Occasion, V’s evidence was that Victoria had arranged to meet up with her and subsequently they met the Accused, Fu, Ng and Tan.

</div> As for Victoria, no evidence was tendered as to when she appeared in court for her own case. In any event, I found the witnesses’ inconsistencies as to the dates of the 3rd and 4th Occasions to be immaterial. It should be borne in mind that where a witness gives evidence on a matter after a significant lapse of time, “[a]dequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection” (see <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Singh Kalpanath</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 158 at [54] and [60]). In the present case, the 3rd and 4th Occasions occurred some three years before the conditioned statements were recorded and some four years before the commencement of trial and it was reasonable to expect that the witnesses’ memories of the incidents may fade over time. In Victoria’s case, she was not even slated as a witness in this trial, and the decision to call her was only made after V testified in court that Victoria was with her on the 3rd Occasion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>That said, whether the 3rd Occasion preceded the 4th Occasion did not materially affect and was not detrimental to the Prosecution’s case. It was clear from the witnesses’ evidence that they were all referring to the same occasion. Ultimately the Accused’s defence was that he had never gone with V to any block of flats and the 3rd Occasion was a “fake”. The issue thus, was whether the 3rd Occasion happened at all, regardless of whether it was in late 2013 or early 2014.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Findings on the 6th charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>I was satisfied that V was telling the truth regarding the 3rd Occasion.

I should add, for completeness, that it is not a requirement that Tan and Ng must actually have felt threatened as a matter of fact (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton</span> at [63]). Nevertheless, in this case Tan had stated (and which I believed) that he was afraid when the Accused pointed the knife at him.

When Fu tried to discourage the Accused from wanting to have sex with V, the Accused punched and kicked him, and took a brick, with which he threatened to smash Fu’s and V’s faces.

</div> V then agreed to have sex with the Accused and, after he raped her, he made Fu and V pose in a compromising position so that he could take photographs of them as leverage. On the other hand, the Accused claimed that when Fu and V arrived at the Yew Tee NTUC Foodfare to meet him, V was “giving [Fu] attitude” whereupon Fu wanted to speak to V alone. Thereafter Fu and V left the Yew Tee NTUC Foodfare, whilst the Accused stayed behind. The Accused stated that he did not accompany Fu and V to any block of flats, and claimed that Fu had taken Photo P20 with a self-timer on his phone and sent the photo to him.

</div> In other words, the 25 January 2014 meeting was Fu’s idea and planned at his initiation. However, in cross-examination, the Accused admitted that he had called V to meet her, and this was regardless of Fu’s purported “plan” – the hand phone messages between the Accused and Fu on that day (“Whatsapp messages”) corroborated this (see [74] below).

</div> I disbelieved him and found his explanation inherently inconsistent. First, the Accused claimed that the word “fuck” meant “beat” and that he had intended to meet V to beat or scold her – however, when he was reminded of his earlier evidence that he never touched girls because of gang rules, he changed his position and stated that he only intended to meet V to scold her.

I found that the Whatsapp messages showed that Fu was testing the waters for the Accused’s reaction to Fu pretending to be V’s boyfriend. This was dismissed by the Accused who relayed the following messages to Fu: (a) Fu was in no position to speak up for V; (b) what the Accused intended to do to V, Fu should not get in the way; (c) V was no more than a “fk buddy”; and (d) even if V was Fu’s girlfriend, the Accused “[would not] give a fk”.

It was unbelievable that V would give Fu “attitude”, after she had sought Fu’s help to protect her from the Accused and Fu had accompanied her to meet him.

Pertinently, whilst the forensic examination of the Accused’s hand phone revealed that he had <span class="font-italic">sent</span> Photo P20 to Fu’s hand phone, no such photograph of P20 (or the two other photographs of Fu and V together as found in the photo collage) was found in the Whatsapp <span class="font-italic">received </span>items on the Accused’s hand phone.

I thus accepted V’s evidence that he had raped her, after he had beaten up Fu and threatened both Fu and V with a brick. I also found that Photo P20 (and the two other photographs of Fu and V together,  as found in the photo collage) was taken by the Accused when he forced Fu and V to pose in a compromising position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>I turn to deal with the matters raised by defence counsel. First, Mr Choh suggested that the photographs in the photo collage showed Fu “smiling” when he was posing with V; Fu disagreed that this was the case. Having examined the photographs, I was not able to come to any such conclusion, as it was unclear what Fu’s facial expression was. In fact, it was even possible to infer, in the photograph that showed Fu walking away from V, that Fu had a look of disgust on his face. In any event, Mr Choh’s assertion that Fu had admitted that he was laughing in the photographs

</div> Hence, at best, this point was neutral. If Mr Choh’s point was to show that Fu was lying about the Accused <span class="font-italic">being present</span> with Fu and V at the block of HDB flats when the photograph was taken (since the Accused’s defence was that he was never there), the supporting evidence showed otherwise. This included the forensic evidence of the Accused’s hand phone and the Whatsapp messages (at [74] – [76] and [78]). I add that it did not make sense<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>for V to implicate the Accused, rather than Fu, if Fu were the one who had instigated V to pose with him in the indecent manner for the photographs to be taken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>Second, Mr Choh submitted that it did not make sense for V to agree to meet the Accused that day despite having been purportedly raped by him on three previous occasions. In my judgment, whilst a reasonable response might be to avoid one’s perpetrator completely having been previously abused, V’s actions had to be viewed in the light of her age (she was only 13 years old then) and her history of abuse at home and at the Accused’s hands. It was also not the case that she had readily met the Accused on her own on the 4th Occasion. She had first confided in Fu, who had already known of the Accused’s previous abuse of her. She was assured by Fu that he would accompany her to see the Accused to persuade him to stop abusing her, by Fu pretending to be her boyfriend.

I found that the above hand phone messages were insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the Prosecution’s case. It was also possible, looking at the messages, that Fu had responded with displeasure after the Accused sent Photo P20. Moreover, the fact that Fu confronted the Accused about breaking his promise to delete Photo P20 did not necessarily imply that the Accused had not previously threatened Fu with a brick or hit him. At best, this point was neutral. The Accused was Fu’s gang leader and he had a fearsome reputation even among his gang members; thus Fu was cautious in his response to the Accused. Mr Choh also submitted that Fu’s claim, that the Accused had promised to delete Photo P20 after he had taken it, made no sense. However, I accepted Fu’s explanation that the Accused had told him that he had intended to use the photograph as leverage against V but not Fu and hence he had reassured Fu that he would delete the photograph.

</div>
</div>
</div> Crucially, V did not frequent Lot 1, Lot 2 or anywhere else with the intention of being with the Accused alone and on all the occasions that she met him, their meetings were not at her initiation. For instance, the 3rd Occasion was arranged by others, and V did not expect to see the Accused. The 4th Occasion was initiated by the Accused, and V met him after Fu agreed to accompany her, thinking that Fu would speak up for her to ask the Accused not to bother her anymore. In fact, at the time the Accused called V to meet him on the 4th Occasion, V was reluctant to do so and hence called Fu for help.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>I pause to add that V’s behaviour of continuing to meet the Accused given that she was a victim of his repeated sexual abuse might seem strange. However, as Aedit Abdullah J stated in his oral grounds in <span class="font-italic">PP v Roger Yue Jr</span> (CC 75 of 2017), which I agree with, “while the average adult may be expected to react in a particular way and would have been expected to resist or to report or complain about an assault as soon as possible, a juvenile could not be expected to always react similarly. The thinking process, assumptions and viewpoint of a juvenile victim may lead to a course of action that may appear unreasonable or improbable.” Moreover, different victims react and cope differently with assault and trauma, and a victim may even rationalise his or her own reaction. For instance, even when V had suspected what might happen to her on the 3rd Occasion, she continued to follow the Accused as she felt that she had no choice and felt resigned to the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>This ties in to the next point, that V had not made any formal complaint to the police until shortly after the photo collage was circulated in July 2014, despite having been raped on various occasions since end 2013. I accepted that V did not do so for fear of being judged and viewed as “loose”, and did not find her conduct to be out of the ordinary. It is not unusual for victims of sexual abuse not to report such traumatic experience until much later or at all, as it is embarrassing and distressing, and for fear of repercussions and being stigmatised. I reiterate V’s circumstances at the material time: she was only 13 years old and the Accused was much older; she knew that the Accused was a notorious gang leader who resorted to violence (as he himself admitted); and she came from a broken home where she had experienced physical abuse. It was not that V was not traumatised by the incidents – she testified that she coped by cutting herself.

</div> Again, I did not find this unusual. The Accused had deliberately, in the photo collage, added a picture of V’s face prominently, so that she could be easily recognised as the person posing in the compromising position with Fu. The Accused admitted that but for that picture, V would not have been identifiable in the photo collage.

In my judgment, this did not affect V’s overall credibility or veracity. As V explained, it was very sudden and unexpected when she discovered the photo collage on social media. Her friends started querying her on the photo collage and at that time, she was “very stressed” and felt that she had to explain her situation.

</div> When she made the First Report, she was reluctant to reveal all that the Accused had done, especially in the presence of her mother and others who had accompanied her to the police station. Hence, she did not reveal the full extent of what the Accused had done in the First Report, as her main focus then was to report on the cyber-bullying by the Accused and to explain the photo collage. V’s conduct was reasonable and not unusual given the situation that she was in then. Likewise, although there were some discrepancies in the First Report, such as the month of the 4th Occasion (stated as March 2014), these did not affect the overall credibility and veracity of V’s testimony. The First Report was made in a hurry and V did not have time to reflect on the details then; even in court she could only recall that the 4th Occasion happened sometime in early 2014 but not the actual month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>V subsequently lodged the Second Report after Fu contacted her regarding the circulated photo collage and wanted to have their names cleared.

</div> By then, V had time to think through the matter and decided to report on the rape incidents. I did not find that when Fu accompanied V to make the Second Report, there was any intention between them to fabricate allegations against the Accused. By then, V had made the First Report (without Fu knowing until after it was made) recounting details of the 4th Occasion (albeit omitting the rape incident). In fact, Fu stated that V was hesitant to make the Second Report but he persuaded her to do so as he felt that the contents of the First Report (recounted to him by V) were incomplete.

In both reports, V had recounted three occasions of rape by the Accused, namely two occasions at Lot 2 (or referred to as the building near Lot 1) and one occasion at the staircase of a block of HDB flats at Yew Tee. Although V’s accounts to Dr Rajeswari and Dr Pathy were incomplete, for instance V had only mentioned one occasion at Yew Tee instead of two, I found that this did not affect V’s credibility or veracity. Both Dr Rajeswari and Dr Pathy were not investigating the case and it was not their purpose to elicit from V exactly what had happened. Dr Pathy’s role was limited to assessing whether V was fit to testify in court and whether she had any psychiatric or psychological issues that needed to be addressed, and Dr Rajeswari’s role was to conduct a medical examination of V.

If she wanted to go further, she could have fabricated one incident of rape rather than complicate matters for herself by reporting multiple incidents. There was also no evidence to suggest that V and Fu colluded. At the time the First Report was lodged, V had not even discussed the matter with Fu, who did not know that she had lodged the report until after the fact.

In this case, in addition to the fact that V was below 14 years old and did not consent to the acts on the three occasions, there were other various offence-specific factors. First, there was pre-meditation and planning. On the 2nd Occasion, the Accused made sure that V was alone with him at the Lot 2 staircase by asking Fu to look after Zona whilst the Accused carried out his plan. He was also armed with a spanner with which he used to threaten V to ensure that she would comply with his directions. As for the 3rd Occasion, Fu, Tan and Ng had all stated that they were with the Accused when the Accused decided to call V to meet him. Fu stated that the Accused had informed him that he wanted to lure V out for sex and Ng stated that the Accused had asked Fu, Tan and him whether they also wanted to have sex with her. It was clear that the Accused had used Victoria to lure V out to meet him. On the 4th Occasion, the Whatsapp messages revealed that the Accused had planned to meet V on 25 January 2014 to have sex with her; in fact, on this occasion, the Accused had contacted V directly to meet her alone. Second, the Accused had threatened to use, and had used, violence. On the 2nd Occasion, he hit the wall near V’s face with a spanner; on the 4th Occasion, he pulled V’s hair and took a brick and threatened to smash her face if she did not have sex with him. In my view this was use of violence over and above the force necessary to commit the rape. Third, I found that there was deliberate infliction of special trauma on V by further degradation of her. On the 2nd Occasion, the Accused had forced her to fellate him and to remove her clothes to photograph her. On the 4th Occasion, the Accused forced her to pose with Fu in a compromising position and took photographs of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">108 </span>However, I was unable to agree with the Prosecution that there was severe harm caused to V. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [44(h)], the Court of Appeal acknowledged that every act of rape invariably inflicts immeasurable harm on a victim. However, it is where there are “especially serious physical or mental effects on the victim such as pregnancy, the transmission of a serious disease, or a psychiatric illness” that this is a serious aggravating factor. There should be a relatively severe state of psychological or physical harm for the court to consider it an additional offence-specific aggravating factor.  In this case, there was no evidence that V had contracted a sexually-transmitted disease from the Accused nor had been made pregnant. Although she had resorted to cutting herself, she had been doing so since being abused by her father, and there was no evidence as to the severity of this self-infliction of harm, nor the length of it, that was caused by the Accused’s abuses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">109 </span>The court should also have regard to the “offender-specific” factors (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [62]). In this case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s conduct at trial demonstrated a lack of remorse on his part. He had disparaged V’s character by referring to her as a “joke” and a “slut” and alleged that she slept with a number of persons. There were also no mitigating factors in his favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">110 </span>Although I agreed with the Prosecution that this case fell within the higher end of Band 2 and warranted a sentence on the higher end of that Band, I imposed a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment for each of the 3rd, 6th and 10th charges, taking into account the totality principle. I also imposed the mandatory minimum 12 strokes of the cane for each of the charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sexual assault by penetration under s 376(4)(b) Penal Code (2nd charge)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">111 </span>The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span><span class="font-italic">v PP</span> [2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>”) at [159] has set out three sentencing bands for the offence of sexual penetration of the vagina using a finger. The Prosecution submitted that the present case fell within Band 2 of the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment) as there were various offence-specific factors, but that there should be an uplift for acts of forced fellatio given the more intrusive and degrading nature of the act. As such, the Prosecution submitted for a term of 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">112 </span>The Defence submitted for a term of 8 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, citing <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v BLV</span> [2017] SGHC 154 (“<span class="font-italic">PP v BLV</span>”), which concerned a series of sexual offences perpetrated against the accused’s daughter when she was between 11 and 13 years old. There, the accused was convicted on 10 charges, including two charges of fellatio and was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the fellatio charges. The Defence submitted that the sentence in <span class="font-italic">PP v BLV</span> represented the “glass ceiling” which sentences for s 376(1) offences should not exceed. Furthermore, in that case there was the aggravating factor of abuse of trust between a father and child that was absent here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">113 </span>In <span class="font-italic">PP v BLV</span> at [146], Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) was of the view that whilst a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment was ordinarily warranted for offences under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code, a lower sentence of 10 years was imposed in light of the totality principle. Aedit Abdullah JC also stated at [142] that “the analogy between aggravated sexual assault by penetration and aggravated rape had been drawn by both Parliament and the Courts”. I agreed with the Prosecution that an act of forced fellatio is more intrusive and degrading than sexual penetration of a vagina using a finger. In my view, given the aggravating factors (mentioned earlier in relation to the statutory rape charges), I imposed a term of 11 years’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sexual exploitation of child under s 7(a) CYPA (4th and 11th charges)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">114 </span>In <span class="font-italic">AQW v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> [2015] 4 SLR 150 at [13] (“<span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">QW v PP</span>”), Menon CJ stated that the objective of s 7 of the CYPA is the protection of vulnerable minors from sexual exploitation, and that the minor’s vulnerability and the degree to which the accused has exploited the minor constitute the key considerations in sentencing. Generally, six to eight months of imprisonment would be appropriate where: (a) the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor involved touching of naked genitalia; (b) the minor was 14 years old or above, and did not appear to be particularly vulnerable; (c) the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act; and (d) there was no element of abuse of trust (<span class="font-italic">AQW v PP</span> at [50]). The Prosecution relied on the cases of <span class="font-italic">APA v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> (MA 451/2010, unreported) (appeal from <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v APA</span> [2010] SGDC 544) (“<span class="font-italic">APA v PP</span>”), <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v AZN</span> [2012] SGDC 155 (“<span class="font-italic">PP v AZN</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Sim Wei Liang Benjamin v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>(CCA 25/2015, unreported) (appeal from <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sim Wei Liang Benjamin</span> [2015] SGHC 240) (“<span class="font-italic">Benjamin Sim</span>”) and some other cases, where the offender was charged under s 7(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CYPA for procuring or requesting obscene acts. In those cases the sentence imposed ranged from six to 11 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">115 </span>The Prosecution submitted a sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment for the 4th charge and at least 8 months’ imprisonment for the 11th charge. The difference in the sentences submitted was because Photo P20, the subject of the latter charge, was less obscene in a nature. The Prosecution submitted that the present case was closer to <span class="font-italic">APA</span><span class="font-italic"> v PP </span>and <span class="font-italic">PP v A</span><span class="font-italic">ZN</span> than <span class="font-italic">Benjamin Sim</span>, where the victim had willingly provided a nude photograph to the accused. The Defence submitted that no more than one month’s imprisonment should be imposed on each charge in light of the totality principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">116 </span>In the present case, the offences <span class="font-italic">per se</span> did not involve the touching of any genitalia or abuse of trust. However, V was below 14 years old at that time and, unlike in <span class="font-italic">AQW v PP</span> (where there was no suggestion of any threat or coercion), what V did (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to strip naked for Photo P19 and to pose for Photo P20) had been preceded by threats and use of force. Both offences were also committed immediately after V was raped and was meant to cause V significant humiliation and fear. As such, a sentence higher than the starting point of six months stated in <span class="font-italic">AQW v PP</span> was warranted, and following from the cases cited by the Prosecution, I imposed a term of 10 months’ imprisonment on the 4th charge and 8 months’ imprisonment on the 11th charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Criminal intimidation under s 506 Penal Code (5th, 7th and 9th charges)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">117 </span>In submitting for a sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment each for on the 5th and 9th charges and three months’ imprisonment on the 7th charge, the Prosecution relied on the cases of <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Low Jin Long</span> (CC 33/2014, unreported) (“<span class="font-italic">Low Jin Long</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Lwee Kwi Ling Mary v Quek Chin Huat</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 145, <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Shaikh Salman Bin Anwar Baladaram</span> [2013] SGDC 424 and <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Roman</span> [2015] SGMC 8, where sentences of between two to six months’ imprisonment were imposed. The Defence submitted for a sentence of no more than two months’ imprisonment <span class="font-italic">per</span> charge and relied on <span class="font-italic">Chua Siew Lin v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 497 (“<span class="font-italic">Ch</span><span class="font-italic">ua Siew Lin</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">118 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Ch</span><span class="font-italic">ua Siew Lin</span>, the accused had placed a knife at the neck of her domestic helper. Yong Pung How CJ recognised that the district judge had found that the accused had threatened the domestic helper in a moment of frustration, the threat was not prolonged and the accused had not seriously intended to carry out the threat. In my judgment, the present case (in particular the 5th and 9th charges) was more akin to <span class="font-italic">Low Jin Long</span>, where the threat to cause injury was with intent to put V in significant fear to compel her to perform various acts subsequent to the intimidation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, fellatio, sex, stripping naked and posing for Photos P19 and P20 in the present case). The threats by the Accused were also accompanied by the use of a spanner and a brick respectively. As for the 7th charge, the Accused intended to put fear into Tan and Ng so that they would not report the rape which they had witnessed. Hence I imposed a term of six months’ imprisonment each for the 5th and 9th charges, and a lower term of four months’ imprisonment for the 7th charge as no physical harm was caused to Tan and Ng.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 Penal Code (8th charge)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">119 </span>The Prosecution submitted for a term of at least two months’ imprisonment for the 8th charge, given the Accused’s propensity for violence. He had been sentenced to 24 months of split probation in August 2013 for an offence of rioting with a deadly weapon under s 148 of the Penal Code committed on 23 December 2012. Whilst on probation, he committed additional violence-related offences, and these charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing in the present case. The Defence however submitted for a term of no more than two weeks’ imprisonment given that whatever injuries the Accused had inflicted on Fu were not severe and there were no weapons used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Low Jin Long</span>, the accused pleaded guilty to seven charges, including rape, and consented to have eight charges taken into consideration for sentencing. He had hit the victim on the head with his fist, for which he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. In the present case, I accepted that there was no evidence of any serious injuries suffered by Fu and no weapon was used when the Accused attacked Fu. Nevertheless, regard must be had to the Accused’ propensity for violence. The Accused had committed various offences of using criminal force whilst on probation and committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt even after the 4th Occasion. These formed the charges which he had admitted to, and they were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. As such, I sentenced the Accused to two months’ imprisonment for the 8th charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Circulating obscene object to young person under s 293 Penal Code (12th charge)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span>The Prosecution submitted for a term of three months’ imprisonment for the 12th charge. Although this charge only referred to circulation of Photo P20 to Fu, the Accused had also exhibited the photograph to other gang members, and all these surrounding circumstances had to be taken into account. The Prosecution cited the unreported decision of <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Zulkiflie bin Rahmat</span> (Magistrate’s Arrest Case No 900759 of 2017 and others) (“<span class="font-italic">Zulkiflie</span>”) in which the accused had pleaded guilty to three counts under s 293 of the Penal Code with 13 similar charges taken into consideration. The court imposed a term of between two to three months’ imprisonment for each of the three charges. On the other hand, the Defence submitted that the present offence was one-off and the Accused had circulated Photo P20 only to Fu. As such, a short term of two weeks’ imprisonment was adequate. In my judgment, a term of one month’s imprisonment was appropriate, given that there was only one occasion here, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Zulkiflie</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">122 </span>In conclusion, I imposed the following sentences for the 2nd to 12th charges:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Charge</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offence</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence imposed</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">2nd charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sexual assault by penetration – s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) p/u s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">3rd charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Statutory rape – s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) p/u s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">4th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sexual exploitation of a child – s 7(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) CYPA</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">10 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">5th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Criminal intimidation – s 506 (1st limb) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">6 months’ imprisonment </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">6th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Statutory rape – s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) p/u s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">7th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Criminal intimidation – s 506 (1st limb) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">4 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">8th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Voluntarily causing hurt – s 323 Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">2 months’ imprisonment </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">9th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Criminal intimidation – s 506 (1st limb) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">6 months’ imprisonment </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">10th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Statutory rape – s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) p/u s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">11th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sexual exploitation of a child – s 7(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) CYPA</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">8 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">12th charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Circulating obscene object to young person – s 293 Penal Code</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">1 month’s imprisonment </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">123 </span>I ordered the sentences for the 6th charge and 10th charge to run consecutively.
