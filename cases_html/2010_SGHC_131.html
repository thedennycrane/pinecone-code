<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused, Astro Bin Jakaria, is charged as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">That you, ASTRO BIN JAKARIA,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Between the 19<sup>th</sup> day of June 2008, at about
                        8.26pm, and the 21<sup>st</sup> day of June 2008, at about
                        6.15pm, at Block 508 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 #09-2602, Singapore, did commit
                        murder by causing the death of one Abdul Khalid Bin Othman, male, 61 years
                        old, to wit, by strangling the said Abdul Khalid Bin Othman with a ligature,
                        and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 302 of
                        the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   The relationship between the Deceased and the
                Accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused, Astro Bin Jakaria (FIN No
                    G8098952R) (“the Accused”), is an East Malaysian who first came to
                    Singapore on August 2007. He first met the deceased, Abdul Khalid Bin Othman
                    (NRIC No S2148066E) (“the Deceased”), sometime in September 2007
                    while working as a cleaner for Sengent Company. The Accused referred to the
                    Deceased as “Kak Mie” and knew that the Deceased was a
                    transvestite. In the course of the following one month, their relationship
                    developed rapidly and they became closer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In October 2007, due to poor job performance,
                    Sengent Company terminated the Accused’s employment. The Accused requested
                    for the Deceased’s assistance as he no longer had a place to stay. This
                    led to the Deceased inviting the Accused to stay with him at his flat.
                    Thereafter, the Accused resided at the Deceased’s flat until he left for
                    Malaysia on 6 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Accused returned to Singapore on several
                    occasions and on each visit, he stayed at the Deceased’s flat until his
                    return to Malaysia. The Accused’s passport (D4) showed that he had entered
                    Singapore on 14<sup> </sup>December 2007 and exited on
                    19 December 2007. He re-entered Singapore on 24 December 2007 and left
                    on 29 December 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 9 January 2008, the Accused again
                    returned to Singapore and visited the Deceased at his flat. The Deceased
                    recommended a factory job in Tampines which was taken up by the Accused.
                    Afterwhich, the Accused stayed at the company’s accommodation until he
                    left Singapore on 24 February 2008. This was the only period of time the
                    Accused was employed in Singapore after his termination by Sengent
                    Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       For the duration of each stay in Singapore, the
                    Accused had never contributed to the rent of the Deceased’s flat. In other
                    words, the Deceased provided free lodging to the Accused whenever the latter was
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It was evident that the Deceased was deeply
                    caring towards the Accused. Apart from providing him with shelter, the
                    Deceased’s generosity extended to buying him new clothes, cooking him
                    meals and giving him money when he was short of it (and this was usually the
                    case given the Accused’s unemployment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Deceased lived in a one bedroom HDB flat.
                    His flatmates, one Taher Bin Ahmad and one Kak Timah, slept in the living
                    room/hall of the flat. The Accused slept in the Deceased’s bedroom and
                    shared the same bed with the Deceased during his stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was the Accused’s evidence that from
                    the first night he started sharing the bed with the Deceased, the latter would
                    touch and caress him to arouse his sexual desires. The Accused, prior to
                    19 June 2008, had always warded off his sexual advances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Events leading up to the scuffle between the Deceased and
                the Accused on 19 June 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Accused returned to Singapore again on
                    Sunday 15 June 2008 and stayed at the Deceased’s flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At about 6 pm on 19 June 2008, the
                    Accused met the Deceased at the latter’s workplace at the SMRT Clubhouse.
                    The Accused was told to wait until the Deceased was done with work. While
                    waiting in the store room, the Accused drank one whole bottle of Royal Stout and
                    one third of a bottle of Carlsberg.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At about 8.26 pm, the Deceased and the
                    Accused left for the Deceased’s flat. They reached the flat at about 9
                    p.m., after which, the Deceased gave the Accused $20 to buy some drinks. The
                    Accused then proceeded to a nearby coffee shop and bought a bottle of Carlsberg
                    (P234) and a bottle of Guinness Stout (P235).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Accused returned to the flat at about
                    9.05 pm to 9.10 pm. When he reached the flat, he saw the Deceased clad
                    in a red towel and was applying lotion to his thighs and hands. The Accused then
                    placed the drinks he purchased aside and sat on the bed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Deceased got up and sat next to the
                    Accused. He started to caress the Accused’s hands and thighs and attempted
                    to touch his penis. The Accused pushed the Deceased’s hand away and told
                    him ‘<em>Nanti’</em>, which means
                    ‘wait’ in Malay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Accused then requested for a bottle opener
                    and a glass on two separate occasions. The Deceased obliged and went back and
                    forth twice to get the requested items from the kitchen. After opening and
                    pouring his drink into the glass, the Accused placed the glass on the floor and
                    then removed his T-shirt as he felt warm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Deceased left the room again and brought
                    back a bottle of Drambuie (a type of whisky liquor) (P236). The Accused declined
                    the Deceased’s offer to have the liquor as it was too strong for him. The
                    Deceased then took a sip of the said liquor and sat beside the Accused. The
                    Accused drank the whole bottle of Guinness Stout (P235).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Accused then put on a concert CD into the
                    VCD player. The Deceased, within a few minutes, changed the concert CD to a
                    “blue” VCD which showed man-on-man pornography and proceeded to
                    fondle the Accused. He removed the Accused’s jeans, pulled down his boxers
                    and started performing fellatio on the Accused. All the while, the Accused lay
                    on his back and imagined that it was a woman who was performing fellatio on him.
                    He became sexually aroused and sustained an erection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Deceased then stopped. The Accused then
                    realised that the Deceased was sitting next to him. When the Accused asked
                    “Why?”, the Deceased propositioned to him and said, “Come
                    play my backside”. The Accused flatly declined, saying, “I
                    don’t want, I’m not used to this” and pulled up his boxers.
                    He then went to take his pair of jeans that was hung behind the bedroom
                    door.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Deceased tried to cajole the Accused. He
                    also mentioned that he had given the Accused what he wanted and provided him
                    with lodging. As he started caressing the Accused, the Accused pushed him and he
                    fell backwards into the cupboard and let out a scream. As the Deceased tried to
                    stand up, the Accused saw the Deceased gripping something in his hand and was
                    looking angrily at him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Accused then punched the Deceased’s
                    face. The Deceased fell again and covered his face with his hand while mumbling
                    something and trying to stand up. The Accused pounced on him again and gripped
                    the Deceased from the back of his neck. The Deceased’s head was positioned
                    under the Accused’s right armpit and the Deceased was then pushed onto the
                    bed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Accused went up on to the bed, held the
                    Deceased’s right shoulder, crossed over the Deceased’s body and
                    positioned himself to the right side of the Deceased. He gripped the
                    Deceased’s neck using his left arm and punched the Deceased again. His
                    grip was released as the Deceased was struggling. The Deceased then used his
                    right elbow to strike the Accused’s chest region while struggling at the
                    same time. The Accused fell backwards and tried to grab hold of the Deceased.
                    The Deceased scratched the Accused’s left cheek, left arm and left
                    hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Accused then punched the Deceased’s
                    chest. The Deceased fell backwards onto the mattress. He tried to sit up and the
                    Accused pushed the Deceased again causing him to fall on the floor beside the
                    bed with one foot on the bed. The Deceased groaned in pain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     During the course of the scuffle, the Deceased
                    let out a shriek which alerted his neighbours, one Madam Sua Joo Eng (PW13) and
                    one Madam Sarah Binte Aman (PW21). The Deceased’s denture was also
                    dislodged from his mouth at some point of the scuffle. The Accused, in his
                    attempt to prevent the Deceased from calling the police, grabbed a long-sleeved
                    brown striped T-shirt and tied up the Deceased. The details of how this was done
                    and how it caused the Deceased’s death will be dealt with
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c)   Sequence of events after the Deceased was tied up by the
                Accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     After tying up and immobilising the Deceased,
                    the Accused removed the Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) from his wrist,
                    took his own jacket (P243), and placed it into a black sling bag (P242). He then
                    gathered the clutter of clothes that had been strewn on the floor in the course
                    of the scuffle and hurriedly placed them into the wardrobe. While doing so, the
                    Accused found a gold chain (P162) belonging to the Deceased and took it. He also
                    appropriated the Deceased’s handphone (P146).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As the Accused exited the bedroom, he switched
                    off the lights and locked the bedroom door by pressing the lock and shutting the
                    door behind him. He later hailed a cab and went to Geylang. There, he checked
                    into Hotel 12 Pte Ltd under the name of one Lawrence Anak Nyuak and stayed there
                    from 19<sup> </sup>June 2008 until the time of his arrest.
                    All the while, the Accused had his passport in his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(d)   Events leading up to the discovery of Deceased’s
                body</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     After being told by the Deceased’s
                    flatmate Taher Bin Ahmad (“Taher”) (PW26) that the Deceased was
                    not seen inside the flat since 19 June 2008 and being informed by the
                    Deceased’s sister, one Norita Binte Abdul Latiff that the Deceased was not
                    contactable on 20 June 2008, the Deceased’s adopted daughter, Aini
                    Binte Karim (“Aini”) (PW29) made several attempts to contact the
                    Deceased by calling his mobile phone and residential number.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 21 June 2008 at around 2 pm, Aini
                    decided to lodge a missing person report with the police. Her boyfriend, Ishak
                    Bin Mohamed (“Ishak”) (PW24) however suggested that they should
                    first inspect the Deceased’s flat before lodging the report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At about 5.45 pm, Aini and Ishak arrived
                    at the Deceased’s flat and let themselves in using Taher’s keys. As
                    Taher had earlier informed them that he did not have the keys to the
                    Deceased’s bedroom door, they brought along with them two screwdrivers.
                    Ishak then unsuccessfully tried to pry open the Deceased’s bedroom door
                    using the two screwdrivers, a chopper and a pair of scissors which were found in
                    the Deceased’s kitchen. After his failed attempts, he decided to force his
                    way in by kicking down the bedroom door.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Upon entering the bedroom, Aini switched on
                    the lights. Ishak spotted a blue bag (P233) on the floor. He placed it on the
                    bed and checked the contents of the said bag. The bag contained a silver metal
                    box (P231), a black box (P232) with a ‘Heineken’ watch inside and
                    some male garments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Aini, on the other hand, opened the
                    Deceased’s wardrobe and found that it was in a state of disarray. This was
                    unusual as the Deceased’s clothing were normally hung neatly inside the
                    wardrobe. The metal rod which was used to hang the Deceased’s clothing had
                    fallen off and a pile of clothing was cluttered up at the base of the
                    wardrobe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Aini then looked around the Deceased’s
                    bedroom and caught a glimpse of a portion of hair on the floor next to the bed.
                    She immediately pointed it out to Ishak and asked if that was the Deceased. Aini
                    became hysterical and Ishak quickly brought her to the corridor to calm her
                    down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Ishak then returned to the Deceased’s
                    bedroom. He removed a red blanket (P199) and a small yellow cushion (P200) and
                    found a human body lying face-down. Ishak placed the items he had removed back
                    to their respective positions and swiftly exited the Deceased’s bedroom.
                    He called the police at about 6.15 pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Staff Sergeant Mohammad Ridzwan Bin Taib
                    (“SSgt Ridzwan”) (PW12) and Corporal Ryan Lim Chong Jen
                    (“Cpl Lim”) (PW15) were dispatched to the Deceased’s flat.
                    Ishak led SSgt Ridzwan and Cpl Lim to the Deceased’s bedroom. Ishak
                    removed the same items, which he had removed earlier, that were on top of the
                    body. SSgt Ridzwan and Cpl Lim then saw a body, clad in a brassiere, lying
                    motionless in a prone position. They observed that both of the Deceased’s
                    hands were tied to his back with a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt. Ishak
                    then replaced the items in the same order as he had found them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As foul play was suspected, SSgt Ridzwan
                    instructed Ishak and Cpl Lim to leave the flat to prevent the contamination of
                    the scene. He then contacted duty Senior Investigation Officer, Station
                    Inspector Goh Tia Eng (PW17) and informed him of their findings. The scene was
                    immediately cordoned off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Sergeant Mohamed Nasir Bin Mohaideen Arabi
                    Noordin (“Sgt Nasir”) (PW16), a paramedic, arrived at the
                    Deceased’s flat at about 6.25 pm. As a long-sleeved brown striped
                    T-shirt was tied around the circumference of the Deceased’s neck, Sgt
                    Nasir was unable to take the carotid pulse and had to look for an arterial pulse
                    from the Deceased’s hands instead. Sgt Nasir removed some of the materials
                    covering the Deceased’s lower body which exposed the Deceased’s
                    hands, bound together by the said T-shirt, and took the Deceased’s pulse.
                    No pulse was detected and the Deceased was pronounced dead at
                    6.30 pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At about 10 pm, Associate Professor
                    Gilbert Lau (“A/P Gilbert Lau”), (PW25) a Senior Consultant
                    Forensic Pathologist attached to the Centre for Forensic Medicine, Health
                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”), arrived at the flat and proceeded to
                    examine the scene. At about 11.05 pm, he conducted an external examination
                    of the Deceased’s body at the scene. The estimated post-mortem interval
                    was pronounced to be within the region of 1–2days.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Case for the Prosecution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It was the Prosecution’s case that
                    during the scuffle, the Accused used a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt and
                    tied it around the Deceased’s neck. In doing so, the Accused had committed
                    murder by way of strangulation and was therefore liable for the offence under
                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal
                    Code”) which stipulates that:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Prosecution submitted that it had
                    discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had
                    committed the offence of murder under section 300(c) of the Penal

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Forensic Evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   Autopsy Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A/P Gilbert Lau conducted the autopsy on the
                    Deceased and testified that the cause of death was strangulation by ligature. He
                    observed that the ligature was a long-sleeved, crew neck T-shirt that was
                    applied circumferentially to the Deceased’s neck in a single loop and was
                    secured by a partial slip knot tightly applied at the back of the
                neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was found that the ligature was tightly
                    constricting:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The ligature measured an approximate 30cm in
                            circumference whereas the corresponding ligature mark (measured
                            immediately after the ligature had been removed) was
                        36cm;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Despite the bloating and swelling of the
                            Deceased’s face and other body parts, the ligature mark directly
                            beneath the ligature was actually indented.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Moreover, due to the highly constricting nature
                            of the ligature, the overlying skin around the area where the ligature
                            was applied was well-preserved as compared to other body parts which
                            exhibited signs of decomposition; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Extensive fractures were found on the hyoid bone
                            and thyroid cartilage (as seen in photographs P80 and P81 respectively).
                            The extent of the damage to the laryngeal structures suggested that
                            severe force had been applied.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     A/P Gilbert Lau testified that the severe
                    force that had caused such structural damage would certainly have closed off the
                    airways and blood vessels around the Deceased’s neck completely, thus
                    depriving the Deceased’s brain, heart and vital organs of oxygen. He
                    opined that strangulation by ligature of this nature was sufficient in the
                    ordinary course of nature to cause death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   Toxicology Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Dr. Leong Hsiao Tung
                    (“Dr. Leong”) (PW5) prepared the Toxicology Report (P132) in
                    which it was found that, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    concentration of ethanol in the Deceased’s blood was 9mg/100ml.
                    Dr. Leong’s evidence was that the amount of ethanol was not
                    significant and was likely a result of consumption of alcohol before death or
                    post-mortem production of ethanol. Based on this post-mortem toxicology report,
                    A/P Gilbert Lau was able to rule out the possibility that the Deceased might
                    have been in some way incapacitated before he was set upon by the assailant.
                    This finding combined with the absence of typical defensive injuries on the
                    Deceased’s body suggested that the Deceased was taken by surprise or
                    overpowered very quickly by the assailant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   Other HSA Reports</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The following HSA Reports confirm that there
                    was contact transfer between the Deceased and the Accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Dr. Christopher K C Syn
                    (“Dr. Syn”) (PW11), a forensic scientist, gave evidence based
                    on his Laboratory Report DN-2008-00755 (P133) that the DNA of the Accused was
                    found on the nail clippings (P225) of the Deceased marked “L1” to
                    “L5” and “R5”. The Accused’s blood was also
                    detected (albeit of trace amount) on the said nail clippings marked
                    “R5” and “L4”.</p>

                    No. CR-2008-00119 (P137) which revealed the following

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Thus, the HSA Reports read with A/P Gilbert
                    Lau’s evidence show that the Accused was the person present at the scene
                    and was the one who had applied the ligature onto the Deceased. The defence does
                    not dispute this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The said act was done with the intention of causing bodily
                injury</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Prosecution maintained that the Accused
                    was sober when he committed the alleged offence in the sense that he was not so
                    intoxicated that he was not aware of what he was doing or that what he was doing
                    was wrong. The Accused was also not so intoxicated that he could not have formed
                    the necessary intention to cause bodily injury to the Deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Defence conceded this point and did not
                    rely on the defences of sections 85(2)(b) or 86(2) of the Penal Code, <em>ie</em>, insane intoxication and intoxication negating
                    intention respectively. In other words, the Defence conceded that the Accused
                    had the intention of applying and tying up the ligature on the Deceased. The
                    main issue which divides the Prosecution and Defence is: <em>where</em> the Accused intended to apply and tie the
                ligature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
                cause death</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The fatal injury in this case was
                    strangulation caused by the ligature found on the Deceased’s neck.
                    Considerable force was used in tying the ligature such that acute compression
                    led to the fracture of the laryngeal structures located in the
                neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     A/P Gilbert Lau’s evidence was that the
                    said injury was sufficient, in the normal course of nature, to cause death. He
                    was able to comment, with reasonable confidence, that the application of a
                    ligature of this nature would in all likelihood caused the Deceased to have lost
                    consciousness within a matter of seconds and death would have taken place in a
                    matter of minutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The injury caused was intended and was not accidental or otherwise
                unintentional</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The prosecution submitted that: the tying of
                    ligature was not unintentional; the tying of the partial knot was not
                    unintentional; the winding of the remaining part of the T-shirt around the
                    Deceased’s forearms and wrists was not unintentional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Three possible scenarios as to what might have
                    happened on the night of 19 June 2008 were presented to the court:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Accused knowingly tied the T-shirt around the
                            Deceased’s neck;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">After tying the T-shirt around the
                            Deceased’s mouth, the T-shirt became dislodged and ended up on the
                            neck of the Deceased and was subsequently tightened around the neck by
                            the Deceased’s movements while he was struggling;
                        or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">During the placing of the T-shirt around the
                            mouth, the T-shirt was accidentally or mistakenly placed onto the
                            neck.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It was the Prosecution’s case that the
                    Accused had knowingly tied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck,
                    thereby suggesting that the Accused’s evidence that he only intended to
                    tie the Deceased’s mouth and that he might have accidentally tied it
                    around the Deceased’s neck was untrue. The Prosecution found it pertinent
                    to note that when A/P Gilbert Lau was being cross-examined by the Defence, the
                    Defence had adopted possibility (b). It was only after A/P Gilbert Lau raised
                    the possibility of scenario (c) that the Defence sought to build their case on
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Prosecution also submitted that the
                    Accused’s inconsistent statements (those recorded during investigative
                    stages and those made in court) formed the bulk of lies which were conjured in
                    order to exculpate himself and escape the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Given the inherent inconsistencies of the
                    Accused’s statements, it was thus the Prosecution’s position that
                    the Accused’s statements should be disregarded, and the court should
                    therefore base its decision on the evidence of A/P Gilbert Lau and the objective
                    evidence presented before the court. On such a basis, the Prosecution submitted
                    that it has discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the
                    Accused had committed murder under section 300(c) of the Penal Code against
                    the Deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Case for the Defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It was the Defence’s case that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Accused only intended to tie the ligature
                            around the Deceased’s mouth;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Deceased and the Accused were not
                            lovers;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Prosecution did not discharge its burden of
                            proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed an
                            offence under section 300(c) of the Penal Code; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In any event, the Defence had, on a balance of
                            probabilities, made out the defences of sudden fight and
                            provocation.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s
                mouth</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     During cross examination, Defence counsel
                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature
                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of
                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the
                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his
                    neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s
                    suggestion, reasoning that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If the T-shirt had slipped to the
                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened
                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the
                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the
                            case;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were
                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose
                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the
                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end
                            around his hands and release the ligature; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the
                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly
                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because
                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater
                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid
                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he
                            could apply such severe force to himself.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the
                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards
                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also
                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any
                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such
                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of
                    shock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would
                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had
                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it
                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not
                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The
                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Accused’s statement recorded by
                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on
                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not
                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was
                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the
                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,
                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Accused also repeated that he had no
                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect
                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he
                            was still alive; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In his examination-in-chief, the Accused
                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as
                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did
                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or
                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s
                        mouth.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Finding of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The <em>locus
                        classicus</em> of section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the
                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court in <em>Virsa Singh v State
                        of Punjab</em> AIR 1958 SC 465 <em>(“Virsa
                        Singh”)</em> where it was held at [12] that four elements must
                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is
                        present;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely
                        objective investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that
                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or
                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds
                        further and,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described
                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in
                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective
                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the
                        offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In further explaining the third element, which
                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious
                        injury or a trivial one but <em>whether he intended to
                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present</em>. If he can
                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such
                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not
                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the
                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to
                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious
                        consequences, is neither here nor there. <em>The question, so
                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,
                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but
                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question</em>; and
                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be
                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite
                        conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the case of <em>PP v Lim Poh
                        Lye</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“<em>Lim
                        Poh Lye</em>”) the accused was found to have intended to stab
                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although
                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not
                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a
                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial
                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which
                    the accused intended to cause. As the court in <em>Tan Chee Wee v
                        PP</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“<em>Tan
                        Chee Wee</em>”) at [42] stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends
                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the
                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the
                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily
                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate
                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the
                    death of the Deceased, <em>ie</em>, his intention was to
                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the
                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the
                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around
                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] of <em>Lim Poh Lye</em>, emphasised that the third limb of <em>Virsa Singh</em>, <em>ie</em>, whether a
                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has
                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into
                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at
                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular
                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court in <em>Tan Joo Cheng v PP</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury
                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a
                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,
                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this
                    court to decide <em>on the totality of the evidence having regard
                        to all the surrounding circumstances</em>, whether the requisite
                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by
                    the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused’s police statements and evidence in court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the
                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In relation to the mixed statements of an
                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision of
                        <em>Tan Chee Hwee and another v PP</em> [1993]
                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“<em>Tan Chee
                    Hwee</em>”) is instructive: the court had to approach the
                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the
                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to
                    decide where the truth lay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as
                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a
                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,
                    non-existent characters (<em>ie</em>, Zulkarnian and
                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from
                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of
                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned
                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the
                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then
                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from
                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the
                    Deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     With regard to the Accused’s other
                    statements, <em>ie</em>, P159, P160 and P161, the
                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at
                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to
                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the
                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,
                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the
                    bedroom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his
                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happened <em>during</em> the act of tying up the Deceased:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That he tied one loop around the
                        mouth;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it
                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it
                            around the Deceased’s mouth;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his
                            demonstration in court;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">While answering the court’s question, the
                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;
                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert
                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence
                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This
                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the
                            Deceased.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,
                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor
                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as
                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s
                mouth’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the
                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his
                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to
                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case: <em>how</em>
                    did the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental
                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and
                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most
                    critical junctures?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite
                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn
                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code
                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his
                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not
                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the
                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some
                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent
                    statements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Examination–in-chief of
                            accused</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])
                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of
                        events?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [<em>sic</em>] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My
                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [<em>sic</em>] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will
                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my
                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked
                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery
                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [<em>sic</em>] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me
                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have
                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.
                            How come?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal
                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more
                        details</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    What about the other details?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from
                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had
                        died.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    You were under pressure, were you
                            afraid?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Witness: I was shocked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the
                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being
                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its
                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the
                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the
                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that
                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of
                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between
                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on
                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his
                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and
                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean
                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him
                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was
                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own
                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had
                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,
                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a
                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he
                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in
                    a proper state of mind’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Court of Criminal Appeal in <em>Chan Kin Choi v PP</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 111
                        (“<em>Chan Kin Choi”</em>) held that once
                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were
                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,
                        <em>both the incriminating parts and excuses or
                        explanations</em>, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court
                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and
                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his
                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its
                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the case of <em>Tan Chee
                        Hwee and another v PP</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 493
                        (“<em>Tan Chee Hwee”</em>), there were
                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their
                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated
                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of
                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the
                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his
                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also
                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were
                lies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     As for the second appellant, he admitted
                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of
                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,
                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained
                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the
                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He
                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the
                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far
                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial
                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of
                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,
                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the
                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist
                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a
                    whole and <em>giving such weight to the exculpatory portions of
                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether</em>, the
                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any
                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did
                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly
                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have
                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a
                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court in <em>Tan Chee Hwee</em> was driven to conclude that the injury
                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was
                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See
                [46].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I note that in the application of the
                        <em>Virsa Singh</em> test to the factual matrix of the
                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the
                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as
                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the
                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had
                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be
                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and
                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Objective evidence of the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The forensic evidence, especially those
                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish
                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused
                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question
                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he
                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have
                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had
                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be
                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the
                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when
                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at the <em>back</em> of the Deceased, who was <em>lying
                        face down</em> on the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying
                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could
                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the
                    neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Accused had, at several junctures,
                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the
                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in
                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he
                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As
                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J in <em>PP v Sundarti
                        Supriyanto</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the
                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his
                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly
                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate
                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was
                involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     It is also poignant to note that there are
                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with
                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply
                    the ligature <em>around the Deceased’s neck</em>.
                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was
                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present
                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in
                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the
                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable
                doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I find it compelling to note that the
                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of
                        19<sup> </sup>June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag
                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful
                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a
                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied
                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it
                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure
                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not
                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of
                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his
                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.
                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to
                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the
                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had
                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Moreover, the act of pawning the
                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008
                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends
                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased
                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution
                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the
                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which
                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for
                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the
                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a
                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were
                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the
                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts
                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would
                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The Accused also had in his possession his
                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat
                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet
                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision
                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once
                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from
                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka
                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June
                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are
                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I now consider whether the Accused had
                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in
                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that
                    time. Although motive is not to be equated with <em>mens rea per
                        se</em>, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the
                    right direction as to whether the requisite <em>mens
                        rea</em> for the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of
                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the
                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and
                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the
                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the
                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,
                    gold chain and hand phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It was held in <em>Jagatheesan
                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that
                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the
                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond
                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there
                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be
                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts
                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The
                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the
                    words of <em>XP v PP</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at
                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the
                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s
                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Thus, following the approach in <em>Chan Kin Choi</em> and <em>Tan Chee
                        Hwee</em>, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating
                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate
                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions
                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the
                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the
                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it
                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]
                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a
                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the
                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution
                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature
                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not
                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under
                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The Accused, however, at the point of
                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at
                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to
                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent
                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the
                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was
                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the
                    ligature beneath, <em>ie</em>, whether it was at the mouth,
                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable
                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this
                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting
                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under
                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1"><b>Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder   </b>
<b>*304</b>.Whoever commits culpable homicide
                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —
                    </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with
                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the
                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without
                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to
                        cause death</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence of Provocation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were
                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this
                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the
                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not
                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The relationship between the Deceased and the
                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would
                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the
                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I
                    may not regard the alleged provocation, <em>ie</em>, the
                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.
                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused
                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the
                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai
                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual
                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,
                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and
                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like
                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were
                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that
                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two
                    were lovers was based on the following observations:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved
                            (“sayang”) the Accused;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning
                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his
                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make
                            a passport.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the
                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During
                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’
                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr
                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his
                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name
                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any
                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their
                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to
                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    With regard to the evidence of the
                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence
                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.
                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.
                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was
                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the
                    Accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence
                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In
                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding
                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in
                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them
                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT
                station.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit
                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse
                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the
                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There
                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the
                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were
                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah
                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and
                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of
                    romantic gestures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the
                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she
                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She
                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a
                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted
                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off
                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Witnesses who were told directly that the
                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet
                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen
                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was
                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased
                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his
                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering
                    and bordered on prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Accused’s sexual history as
                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in
                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal
                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his
                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by
                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is
                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the
                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the
                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference
                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do
                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to
                    the incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case of
                        <em>Seah Kok Meng v PP</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“<em>Seah Kok
                        Meng</em>”) (in turn citing <em>PP v Kwan Cin
                        Cheng</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 and <em>Lau
                        Lee Peng v PP</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are
                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of
                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement
                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the
                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and
                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable
                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person
                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would
                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would
                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Actual Loss of Self-Control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It was held in <em>Seah Kok
                        Meng</em> that the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due
                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his
                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of
                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On
                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.
                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was
                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to
                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move
                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,
                        <em>ie</em>, he found his implement and took the
                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a
                lesson.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the
                    case of <em>Lim Chin Chong v PP</em> [1998]
                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“<em>Lim Chin
                        Chong”</em>) owing to the factual similarities with the present
                    case. In <em>Lim Chin Chong</em>, the appellant was a
                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute
                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal
                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of
                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as
                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the
                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the
                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some
                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also
                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room
                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to
                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of
                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the
                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual
                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,
                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They
                    were calculated and premeditated acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    It was the Defence’s case that the
                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the
                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to
                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually
                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had
                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on
                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that
                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one
                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk
                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result
                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased
                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did
                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,
                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you
                            have to punch him? Understand the question?</p>

                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then
                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to
                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk
                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well
                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the
                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,
                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my
                            anger because prior to the 19<sup>th</sup>, he had in
                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry
                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my
                            control on the 19<sup>th</sup>, that resulted in all
                            this tragedy, your Honour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,
                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious
                    or drunk as he had claimed, <em>ie</em>, his evidence which
                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that
                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:</p>

                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the

                            put it on;</div>

<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">Ishak and Aini had given evidence that
                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the
                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,
                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed
                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the
                                    flat;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">Ishak and Aini testified that the body
                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.
                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s
                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s
                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for
                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution
                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy
                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had
                                    covered the body accidentally;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">According to the Accused, he finished
                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already
                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle
                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the
                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had
                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted
                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if
                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">After arriving in Geylang, the Accused
                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own
                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to
                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under
                                    the other’s name.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the
                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully
                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of
                self-control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In the case of <em>Seah Kok
                        Meng</em>, the court did not take into account the level of
                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost
                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts in <em>Seah Kok
                        Meng</em> are different from the present case. The accused in
                        <em>Seah Kok Meng</em> had committed murder some seven
                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,
                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle
                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if
                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing
                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I note that counsel has not cited any
                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)
                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the
                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to
                    a murder charge. In <em>PP v Tharema Vejayan s/o
                        Govindasamy</em> [2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses
                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the
                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so
                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the
                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether
                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of
                    intoxication or the effects thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    There are significant authorities which have
                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in
                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff
                    in the case of <em>R v Morhall [1995]
                        3 WLR 330</em> (House of Lords) at page 337 held that a
                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered
                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not
                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to
                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or
                    drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    This court takes the view that the <em>subjective assessment</em> of whether the accused lost his
                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only
                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or
                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would
                    be able to exonerate himself from an offence <em>solely</em> because he was intoxicated could be alleviated as
                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken as <em>one of the
                        factors</em> in determining whether he was in fact deprived of his
                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant
                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the
                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. See
                        <em>Seah Kok Meng</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Moreover, taking into account the state of
                    intoxication of an accused in the <em>subjective
                        determination</em> of loss of self-control would not detract from
                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking
                    intoxicating substances (<em>ie</em>, drink or drug) could
                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of
                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of
                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man
                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar
                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is
                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation
                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should
                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been
                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case of <em>Wright v
                        The Queen</em> [1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held
                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation
                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,
                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.
                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would
                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this
                approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost
                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of
                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court
                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of
                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether
                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his
                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that
                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long
                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the
                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into
                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in
                    the <em>subjective determination</em> of whether or not the
                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony
                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his
                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of
                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral
                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed
                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight
                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that
                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself
                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take
                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    As MPH Rubin J in <em>Sundarti Supriyanto</em> at [154] observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviour
                            <em>must</em> be observed on the part of the
                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her
                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently
                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an
                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the
                        actions of the killer post-killing in <em>PP v Kwan Cin
                            Cheng</em> differed from the actions of the killer in <em>Lau Lee Peng v PP</em>. Everything depended on the facts
                        of the individual case. <b><em>A general submission that the
                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm
                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was
                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in
                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,
                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own
                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing
                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused
                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person
                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on
                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost
                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons in <em>Seah Kok Meng</em> and <em>Lim Chin Chong</em>,
                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was
                    relatively short, <em>ie</em>, an approximate 30 minutes.
                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a
                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant
                    in <em>Lim Chin Chong</em> was found not to have his lost
                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present
                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male
                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the
                    factual circumstances between <em>Lim Chin</em> Chong and
                    the present case are quite different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sudden and Grave Provocation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The Court of Appeal in <em>Lim Chin Chong</em> also did not find that the provocation was grave
                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the
                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed
                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members
                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the
                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so
                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his
                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was
                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal
                    intercourse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    If it did, then the immediate and
                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to
                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical
                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court in <em>Lim Chin Chong</em> opined that on any objective test the provocation
                    of being sodomised had simply <em>evaporated</em> and the
                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the
                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which
                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The Defence submitted that the
                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was
                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave
                    and sudden provocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In determining whether there was
                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should
                    be drawn with the case of <em>Sundarti Supriyanto</em>
                    whereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a
                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]
                    to [165].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering
                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The
                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the
                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed
                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started
                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious
                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the
                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with
                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,
                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The Accused testified that on the night of
                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the
                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the
                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of
                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further
                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being
                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the
                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused
                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The Prosecution further submitted that
                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the
                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the
                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other
                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused
                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Although there was an estimated time lapse
                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the
                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into
                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to
                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden
                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short
                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of
                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the
                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness
                    is satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was
                    ‘grave’, it was found in <em>DPP v Camplin</em>
                    [1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery
                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave
                    provocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In the Australian case of <em>Green v R</em> [1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been
                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,
                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a
                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.
                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his
                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his
                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately
                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the
                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the
                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’
                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the
                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father
                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual
                    advances’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The classic justification for the existence
                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.
                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’
                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most
                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently
                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative
                    they would be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The Accused in the instant case was
                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal
                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to
                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a
                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an
                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does
                    amount to a grave provocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused
                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he
                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s
                    head. The case of <em>DPP v Camplin</em>
                    [1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of
                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would
                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured
                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man
                        to a coloured man.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As Jeremy Horder in <em>Provocation and
                        Responsibility</em> (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138
                    pointed out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]t the root of <em>provoked</em> anger, which is
                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and
                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is
                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a
                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.
                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation
                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to
                        retaliate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Thus</em>, the Deceased’s emotional
                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.
                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on
                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the
                    gravity of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    This court therefore finds, on balance of
                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a
                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still
                    being deprived of his power of self-control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence of Sudden Fight</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception
                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Exception 4</em>.—Culpable homicide is not
                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the

                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The three requirements to be met for the

                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a
                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this
                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that
                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere
                quarrel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps
                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. See <em>Tan Chee Wee</em> at [61]. In <em>Tan Chee
                        Wee</em>, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a
                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there
                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had
                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The forensic evidence before this court
                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was
                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive
                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The Defence suggested that the congealed
                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an
                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P
                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that
                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.
                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been
                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the
                            Deceased’s face; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The congealed blood, in all probability, would
                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the
                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied
                            ligature to the neck.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Even if I were to characterise the brief
                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied
                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passion <em>upon a sudden
                        quarrel</em>. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the
                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.
                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must
                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions
                    caused by a sudden quarrel. See <em>Tan Chee Wee</em> at
                    [63].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or
                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out
                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does
                    not apply to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In light of the foregoing, I find the
                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal
                    Code. However, I made a finding in <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a>
                    above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under
                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is
                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause
                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under
                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence
                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under
                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and
                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.</p>
