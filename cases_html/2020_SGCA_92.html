</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In HC/OS 1282/2018 (“OS 1282”), the appellant applied for leave to act as a director under s 155A(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). In the alternative, he applied for a declaration that he had not been disqualified as a director under s 155A(1) of the Companies Act. We set out the precise terms of the appellant’s originating summons at [18] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The respondent, representing the Minister for Finance (“the Minister”), opposed OS 1282. On 8 April 2019, the High Court judge (“the Judge”) dismissed OS 1282. The Judge held that s 155A(1) was triggered on 8 January 2018. Thus, the appellant was disqualified as a director for a five-year period which commenced on 9 January 2018. The Judge also dismissed the appellant’s leave application under s 155A(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The appellant appealed against the entirety of the Judge’s decision. On 12 August 2020, we dismissed the appeal with brief oral grounds. However, in respect of the date of disqualification, we held that s 155A(1) was not triggered on 8 January 2018. It was instead only triggered on 6 August 2018. As a result, the appellant was disqualified from 7 August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the hearing of the appeal, we indicated that we would issue detailed grounds in due course given the important legal issues that arose in this case. These issues included the proper construction of s 155A(1) as well as the relevant principles in determining whether leave should be granted under s 155A(3). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The relevant statutory provision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Section 155A of the Companies Act is a provision that came into force on 3 January 2016.

However, assuming that s 155A(1) was triggered on 8 January 2018, the relevant date should have been 9 January 2018 instead, because the five-year disqualification period only commences <span class="font-italic">after</span> the date s 155A(1) is triggered (see [5] above).

However, as a matter of drafting, the prayer should simply have stated that the appellant was seeking a declaration that he had not been <span class="font-italic">disqualified</span> under s 155A(1). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As mentioned at [2] above, the Judge dismissed OS 1282.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Judge held that s 155A(1) was triggered on 8 January 2018 when CB Asia and GB Retail were struck off. Although the appellant had only been a director of one other company that was struck off by the Registrar before that date, the Judge declined to apply the ordinary meaning of s 155A(1). Instead, he was of the view that it was appropriate to adopt a rectifying construction of s 155A(1). The Judge explained as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I accept that on 8 January 2018, when the second and third companies were struck off, the effect was to disqualify the [appellant] automatically with effect from 9 January 2018. I arrive at that conclusion on the basis that the purpose of s 155A(1) is to disqualify a director automatically if three of his companies are struck off within five years, with such disqualification to take effect after the date of the third striking off.

In essence, the appellant’s argument was based on the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations. The appellant highlighted that ACRA’s 31 August 2018 Letter only identified GB F&amp;B, CB Asia and GB Retail as the companies that formed the basis of his disqualification. GB Holdings was not identified at all (see [17] above). Accordingly, there arose the legitimate expectation “that his disqualification would be limited to that which was pronounced by ACRA”.

In applying for leave to act as a director of any company that he may be appointed to, and for such leave to take effect from 8 January 2018, the appellant was essentially seeking to completely negate the application of s 155A(1).

In the present case, our analysis was greatly simplified by the fact that there is no ambiguity or obscurity on the face of s 155A(1). It provides that a person is disqualified from acting as a director for five years if he was a director of a company that was struck off by the Registrar under s 344 of the Companies Act and within a period of five years <span class="font-italic">immediately before that date</span>, was also a director of no fewer than <span class="font-italic">two</span> other companies that were similarly struck off.

In substance, both sources simply stated that a person would be disqualified if he was a director in not less than three companies that were struck off by the Registrar within a five-year period.

</div> According to the respondent, this was because applying the ordinary meaning of s 155A(1) would result in the following consequences: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A director who had three companies struck off by the Registrar would fall afoul of s 155A(1) if the first two companies were struck off on the same day and the third company was struck off on a later day. The respondent referred to this as a “2 plus 1” sequence. However, a director whose companies were struck off in a “1 plus 2” sequence, like the appellant, would not face disqualification.

</div> However, in <span class="font-italic">Inco</span>, the House of Lords cautioned that the satisfaction of these three conditions does not necessarily mean that a rectifying construction should be adopted.

Although the doctrine was recognised by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority </span>[2014] 1 SLR 1047 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span>”),

</div>
</div> we decided in <span class="font-italic">SGB</span><span class="font-italic"> Starkstorm </span>to neither affirm nor overrule <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span>, since it was not necessary for us to decide the issue in that case (at [41]). Nonetheless, we expressed the view that the doctrine would represent a “significant departure from our current understanding of the scope and limits of judicial review” and that the “difficulties inherent in accepting the doctrine … in Singapore should not be underestimated” (at [59] and [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Similarly, in the present case, it was not necessary for us to decide the threshold question of whether the doctrine is or should be accepted as part of our law. This is because we were satisfied that it would be of no assistance to the appellant in any event.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In essence, the doctrine was inapplicable in the present case. The issue was whether s 155A(1) was triggered on 6 August 2018 when GB Holdings was struck off. This was purely a legal determination that was for the court to make, and not ACRA. The appellant appeared to assume that ACRA had the discretion to decide which companies formed the basis of his disqualification and the relevant disqualification period. However, if the facts before the court showed that s 155A(1) was triggered on the date on which GB Holdings was struck off, such that the appellant was disqualified for five years thereafter, the fact that ACRA failed to mention GB Holdings in the 31 August 2018 Letter would not in any way affect that outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As was stated in <span class="font-italic">SGB </span><span class="font-italic">Starkstrom </span>at [42], the doctrine is concerned with “regulating the exercise of executive powers in the administration of executive actions or policies”. For example, in <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">egina v North and East Devon Health Authority; Ex parte Coughlan</span> [2001] 1 QB 213, referred to in <span class="font-italic">SGB </span><span class="font-italic">Starkstrom </span>at [37], the applicant agreed to move to a nursing home on the health authority’s clear promise that the nursing home would be her home for life. Subsequently, the health authority decided to close down the nursing home. The applicant challenged this decision by way of judicial review, on the ground that she had a legitimate expectation that the nursing home would be her home for life. The English Court of Appeal granted the appellant the substantive relief she sought and ordered the health authority not to close down the nursing home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the other hand, the doctrine is irrelevant when what is in issue is purely a question of law to be determined by the court based on the relevant statutory provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In any case, even if the doctrine was applicable in Singapore, and even if we had considered that the doctrine was potentially relevant to the issue of whether s 155A(1) was triggered on 6 August 2018, the appellant would not have satisfied the necessary requirements under the doctrine (see <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [119]). In particular, we did not see how the appellant could have <span class="font-italic">relied </span>on the 31 August 2018 Letter when he in fact disagreed with the very basis of the letter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was disqualified when CB Asia and GB Retail were struck off on 8 January 2018. It was central to the appellant’s case in respect of Issue 1 that ACRA had, in its 31 August 2018 Letter, erred in its assessment of his disqualification and the attendant disqualification period. We did not see how the appellant could then argue, as part of Issue 2, that he had relied on the 31 August 2018 Letter to his detriment, such that any subsequent striking off not stated in the letter should be disregarded by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The appellant argued that he had written to the companies of which he was a director to inform them of his purported disqualification from 9 January 2018. However, this point was of no assistance to the appellant. It was not as though the appellant had <span class="font-italic">accepted</span> his purported disqualification and informed the relevant companies that he would cease acting as a director. In fact, it was expressly stated in his letters to the companies that he would be <span class="font-italic">contesting</span> ACRA’s assessment by applying to the court for a declaration that he had not contravened s 155A(1).

</div> As a matter of “procedural fairness”, the respondent should not be permitted to object to OS 1282 on the basis of GB Holdings, when this was not communicated as a basis for the appellant’s disqualification. We did not see how the substance of this submission was any different from that based on the doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Apart from the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations, counsel for the appellant, Mr Eddee Ng, argued before us that it would be “unfair” to take into account the striking off of GB Holdings on 6 August 2018. This was because prior to that date, the appellant had already been put under the pain of the penalty of offending under s 155A(2) of the Companies Act. Pursuant to s 155A(2), any person who contravenes s 155A(1) is potentially liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both (see [5] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 We had difficulty understanding why there would be any question of unfairness. If s 155A(1) prescribed certain consequences upon the occurrence of certain events, the court simply did not have the discretion not to give effect to those consequences. Furthermore, although it would be unsustainable in any event, any question of unfairness would only arise if the appellant had ceased<span class="font-italic"> </span>to act as a director from 9 January 2018 because of the risk that he might be prosecuted for an offence under s 155A(2). However, as stated at [14] above, the appellant did not even know of his purported disqualification until 12 September 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Accordingly, we held that s 155A(1) was triggered on 6 August 2018.

</div> There, the High Court considered that the “predominant factors” to consider for a s 155A(3) application were “the circumstances leading to [the applicant’s] disqualification” and the “likelihood of compliance with the statutory requirements for filings going forward” (at [52]). However, it was not necessary in that case to consider whether the applicant ought to have been granted leave under s 155A(3) as relief was granted under s 344G(3) of the Companies Act instead (at [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  We agreed with both parties that the factors identified in <span class="font-italic">Bijynath</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were relevant in a leave application under s 155A(3),

</div> although we did not regard them as being the “predominant factors”. In our judgment, whether leave should be granted will depend on a holistic assessment of the following considerations. We emphasise that these considerations are not intended to be exhaustive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 First, the court should consider the applicant’s capacity for compliance in the future. In the case of defunct companies of which he is a director, the applicant should take steps to wind up these companies or strike them off the register under s 344A of the Companies Act. If, for whatever reason, the applicant is unable to do so, he should ensure that these companies comply with the statutory requirement to file annual returns under s 197 of the Companies Act. He should also ensure that his active companies comply with their filing requirements so that the Registrar would not think that they are defunct companies and proceed to initiate a striking off.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, it should be considered whether there were any exculpatory reasons for the applicant’s failure to wind up or procure the striking off of the companies that were struck off by the Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Third, we were also provisionally of the view that, as a general rule, it should be incumbent on an applicant to provide some detail about the specific company or group of companies for which leave is being sought. He should also explain why it is necessary for him to be a director in these companies. The court will then examine whether leave should be granted in respect of each company individually. Save in exceptional cases, leave should not be granted to an applicant who seeks leave to act as a director in any company that he may be appointed to. We refer to this as a “blanket leave application”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 While the suggested approach is a provisional view given that we did not have the benefit of full arguments on this point, there are at least three reasons which support it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, s 155A(3) itself appears to contemplate leave being granted in respect of a specific company or group of companies. Section 155A(3) specifically states that a disqualified director can apply to the court for leave to act as a director of “<span class="font-italic">a</span> company or <span class="font-italic">a</span> foreign company” [emphasis added]. The plain wording of s 155A(3) does not refer to a blanket leave application and instead suggests that the applicant has to identify<span class="font-italic"> </span>the relevant company or companies. Section 155A(3) also states that the applicant has to give the Minister not less than 14 days’ notice of his intention to apply for leave. This again suggests that he has to identify and give reasons specific to the company or companies for which leave is sought, so that the Minister can decide whether to oppose his application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, s 155A(3) does not provide the court with the discretion to <span class="font-italic">reduce</span> the five-year disqualification period. However, that would in effect be the outcome of a successful blanket leave application. Accordingly, the approach that we have suggested would ensure that the court does not undermine the default position set out by Parliament, namely, a five-year disqualification period in respect of all companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Third, some guidance can be drawn from leave applications under s 154(6) of the Companies Act. Section 154 of the Companies Act provides that a director is disqualified if he is convicted of certain offences. It is well-established that in considering whether leave should be granted under s 154(6), the court may have regard to various factors, one of which is “the structure and the nature of the business of each of the companies which the applicant seeks the leave of the court to become a director of or to take part in its management”. The court may also consider “the interests of the general public, the shareholders, creditors and employees of these companies and the risks to the public and to those persons should the applicant be permitted to be a director or to take part in management” (see <span class="font-italic">Huang Sheng Chang</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Attorney-General </span>[1983–1984] SLR(R) 182 at [38]).

</div> It appeared to us that these considerations would also be relevant for leave applications under s 155A(3), which would therefore require an examination into the specific companies that the director is seeking leave for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Indeed, in the context of s 155A(3), this approach would be consistent with the decision of the High Court in HC/OS 1342/2018, <span class="font-italic">Re Ronnie Tan Siew Bin</span>.

</div> There, the applicant, a practising advocate and solicitor, was disqualified under s 155A(1). He sought leave to act as a director of nine companies. One of these nine companies was the law firm in which the applicant was the founder and managing director. Leave was granted for the applicant to act as a director in respect of his own law firm, although leave was refused for the remaining eight companies. While there were no written or oral grounds for the High Court’s decision, it is implicit that the approach adopted by the High Court was to consider whether leave should be granted in respect of <span class="font-italic">each </span>company. It seemed to us that all things being equal, the court would be more inclined to grant leave if the applicant depends on the relevant company for his livelihood, although this would not be determinative of the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the appellant should be granted leave</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We now explain our reasons for dismissing the appellant’s leave application. The appellant’s leave application was framed in the following terms in the originating summons:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. That the Honourable Court grant leave for the [appellant] to act as director of, or take part in or be concerned in the management of (i) companies incorporated pursuant to the [Companies Act] (or pursuant to any corresponding previous written law); or (ii) foreign companies to which Division 2 of Part XI of the Companies Act applies. This includes the companies set out in Annex A and all other such companies in the future;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. That the leave referred to in prayer 1 be effective from 8 January 2018;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the present case, a significant plank of the appellant’s leave application was his explanation for why he did not or could not procure the striking off of the four companies. However, we held that these reasons did not provide a sufficient basis for granting leave. We preface that analysis with some preliminary observations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Preliminary observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 First, prayer 1 of the originating summons made clear that the appellant had filed a blanket leave application (see [79] above). In keeping with the framework suggested above, the appellant should have identified the specific company or group of companies that he was seeking leave for. He should have explained why it was necessary for him to be a director in these companies (for example, because he was a key executive involved in day-to-day operations). The court would then examine whether leave could be granted in a way that was limited in scope. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Second, we noted that the appellant had set out in Annex A of the originating summons a list of 123 companies, although this was not intended to be an exhaustive list of the companies for which he was seeking leave to be a director of. At the hearing before us, we observed that a significant number of these companies had already been struck off and those companies were reflected as such in Annex A. Mr Ng also confirmed that the appellant did not intend for these struck-off companies to be restored to the register. In the circumstances, it was unclear to us what the purpose of Annex A was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Third, through prayer 2 of the originating summons, the appellant had sought for any leave granted by the court to be effective from 8 January 2018 (see [79] above). In other words, the appellant had sought <span class="font-italic">retrospective</span> leave. It would appear that the purpose for seeking retrospective leave was to regularise acts performed by the appellant as a director notwithstanding his deemed disqualification. In the light of our decision not to grant leave, it was unnecessary to decide whether the court was permitted under s 155A(3) to grant retrospective leave. We therefore leave this issue open for determination on a future occasion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There were no exculpatory circumstances in respect of the appellant’s failure to procure the striking off of the four companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 We turn to the reasons provided by the appellant as to why he did not or could not procure the striking off of the four companies.

This applies <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>to professionals such as the appellant who are regularly appointed as directors in the course of their work. As reflected in Annex A of his originating summons, the appellant had been a director of at least 123 companies in Singapore prior to his disqualification. The appellant should have been aware of s 155A, notwithstanding that it was not referred to in the Section 344(1) Letter for GB F&amp;B. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 That said, we were also of the view that it was potentially misleading for ACRA to have stated that “no action is needed”, especially when there was no reference to s 155A in the letter. In our view, such wording should be avoided by ACRA. Nonetheless, on the facts of this case, there was no prejudice caused to the appellant. This was because the Section 344(1) Letters for CB Asia, GB Retail and GB Holdings all contained references to s 155A(1).

</div> Accordingly, the respondent filed an application to adduce further evidence in CA/SUM 63/2020 to prove that the appellant had continued to act as a director after 9 January 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The respondent’s application was granted on 22 June 2020. Among other things, the further evidence showed that the appellant had filed or verified the annual returns of 26 companies between 3 August 2018 and 28 February 2019.

</div> There was therefore no basis for the appellant to have claimed that he had ceased to act as a director upon his purported disqualification. Indeed, as we have already stated, the appellant was unaware of his purported disqualification until 12 September 2018 (see [14] above).

</div> Accordingly, we did not give any weight to the appellant’s contention that he had served a disqualification period of two years and seven months. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Leave application for Borrelli Walsh </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Finally, at the hearing before us, Mr Ng urged us to consider granting leave for the appellant to act as a director of Borelli Walsh, in the event that we were to dismiss his blanket leave application. However, this was a change of position on appeal. As we explained to Mr Ng at the hearing, we considered that the proper course was for the appellant to first give notice to the Minister of his intention to specifically apply for leave in respect of Borrelli Walsh. This was a procedural requirement mandated by s 155A(3). Further, the evidence in support of this leave application should be adduced through an affidavit filed by the appellant, rather than by way of submissions from the Bar. To be clear, we do not in these grounds of decision express any view on the merits of such an application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In the circumstances, we dismissed the appeal. However, we differed from the Judge in respect of the date of disqualification. Since s 155A(1) was not triggered on 8 January 2018, and was only triggered on 6 August 2018, the appellant’s disqualification period commenced on 7 August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 On costs, we ordered the appellant to pay the respondent costs fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements.
