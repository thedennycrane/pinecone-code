        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Hirris Anak Martin (“the first
                    respondent”) and James Anak Anggang (“the second
                    respondent”) were jointly convicted on one charge of robbery with
                    grievous hurt under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) (“the
                    common charge”). The second respondent was also convicted on a separate
                    and unrelated charge of robbery with hurt under s 394 of the Penal Code
                    (“the second charge”). We will refer to them collectively as
                    “the respondents”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The trial judge (“the Judge”)
                    sentenced the respondents to ten years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes
                    of the cane on the common charge, and the second respondent to five years’
                    imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on the second charge. He also
                    ordered the imprisonment sentences imposed on the second respondent to run
                    concurrently (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Hirris Anak Martin and
                        Another</em> [2009] SGHC 132).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The prosecution appealed against the
                    respondents’ sentences. After hearing the prosecution and the respondents
                    in person, we allowed the appeal as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     the respondents’ sentence on
                        the common charge was increased to 15 years’ imprisonment and
                        24 strokes of the cane; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     the second respondent’s imprisonment sentences were
                        to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We now give the reasons for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts relating to the common charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 23 January 2008 at around 11 p.m.,
                    the respondents were drinking with a group of people at No 14 Jalan Suka,
                    off Lorong 24 Geylang. When they ran out of liquor, one member of the group
                    known as “Ah Choi” suggested to the respondents that the three of
                    them could look for someone to rob, to which both respondents readily agreed.
                    Before setting off, the trio picked up a metal rod which was hidden in a drain
                    nearby and took turns to carry it as they went around looking for a
                    victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondents and Ah Choi subsequently spotted
                    a victim, one Abu Saleh Taser Uddin Ahmed (“the deceased”), who
                    was sitting down in an open field next to a car park between Lorong 25 and
                    Lorong 25A Geylang. The deceased was alone. Ah Choi suggested that the
                    three of them beat up the deceased and rob him and the respondents agreed. At
                    this stage, the metal rod was passed to Ah Choi. The three of them approached
                    the deceased, who had lain down on the field by then. Ah Choi struck first,
                    using the metal rod to hit the deceased on the back of his head twice. The
                    deceased managed to get up, but the second respondent pushed him back down with
                    his foot and proceeded to punch and kick him. The first respondent also rained
                    several punches on the deceased’s face. As a result, the deceased became
                    unconscious. Ah Choi then took a brown wallet containing $50.00, an EZ-Link
                    card, a POSB ATM card and some personal papers from the deceased and the trio
                    fled the scene. They went to the rear of a coffee shop along Lorong 24A
                    Geylang where they divided the contents of the wallet among themselves. Ah Choi
                    also used some of the money from the wallet to buy six cans of beer for them to
                    share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The deceased was found lying unconscious in the
                    open field on 24 January 2008 at 6.18 a.m. and was brought to Tan Tock
                    Seng Hospital. Despite undergoing intensive surgery and treatment, he eventually
                    died from his injuries on 30 January 2008. The autopsy report stated that
                    the cause of death was severe head injury consistent with the use of a blunt
                    object to strike the deceased’s head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first and second respondents were
                    subsequently arrested by the police on 4 February 2008. Ah Choi has not
                    been found.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts relating to the second charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Police investigations carried out after the
                    arrest also revealed that the second respondent had been involved in an earlier
                    case of robbery involving a separate victim. On 13 January 2008 at about
                    11.30 p.m., the victim, one Molfot Bepari Moslem Bepari, was walking along
                    Geylang Road near City Plaza towards his dormitory at Joo Chiat Road. He was
                    talking on his hand phone. As the victim was about to reach the bus stop in
                    front of City Plaza, the second respondent approached him from behind and
                    punched him on the right upper lip. When the victim turned around to see who had
                    punched him, the second respondent kicked him to the ground and his hand phone
                    fell out from his hand. The second respondent proceeded to punch and kick the
                    victim several times in the head and face before fleeing with the hand phone,
                    which he subsequently sold for $30.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings in the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Both respondents pleaded guilty to the common
                    charge and, as we have mentioned earlier, were sentenced to ten years’
                    imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The second respondent also pleaded
                    guilty to the second charge and, as we have mentioned earlier, was sentenced to
                    five years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, with both
                    imprisonment sentences to run concurrently. The prosecution appealed on the
                    following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the sentence in respect of the
                        common charge was manifestly inadequate; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the two imprisonment sentences against the
                        second respondent should run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the sentence on the common charge was manifestly
                inadequate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Section 394 of the Penal Code prescribes
                    a sentencing range of between five and 20 years’ imprisonment and a
                    minimum of 12 strokes of the cane. Section 397 provides for an
                    additional minimum of 12 strokes of the cane where, <em>inter alia</em>, grievous hurt is caused in the course of a robbery.
                    Since both respondents would receive the maximum number of strokes (24) in any
                    event, the only issue here was the adequacy of the imprisonment
                terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In this regard, we examined the following
                    sentencing precedents under s 394 where death was caused in committing the
                    robbery:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The above sentencing precedents show that the
                    courts have consistently imposed sentences at the higher end of the sentencing
                    range for s 394 offences where death was caused in the course of the
                    robbery. Even in <em>Roslan</em>, where the victim’s
                    death was completely accidental and the accused was instead convicted of earlier
                    acts of hurt in the robbery, he was sentenced to 12 years’
                    imprisonment. The one anomaly in these precedents is the case of <em>Somrak Senkham</em>, which we will address
                shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Deputy Public Prosecutor
                    (“DPP”) submitted that the Judge had erred in departing from the
                    above sentencing precedents without sufficiently explaining his reasons for
                    doing so. We agreed with this submission. As I stated in <em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Dealing, first, with the issue of the extent to
                            which a lower court is entitled to disregard the guidance given by
                            established sentencing precedents (which commonly set out
                            “guidelines” or “benchmarks”), in our view,
                            it would not be proper for a trial judge to depart from such precedents
                            without, at the very least, giving cogent reasons as to why they should
                            not be applied in the case before him. This approach is based on two
                            basic principles. The first is that a lower court should respect the
                            guidance given by a higher court in similar cases, even though the judge
                            may not personally agree with the views of the higher court. …
                            The second principle, which the Judge had expressly recognised (see [5]
                            of the Judgment), is that like cases should be treated alike. The
                            corollary of this principle is <em>consistency in
                                sentencing</em>, which is achievable only by a lower court
                            adhering, over a period of time, to sentencing guidelines or benchmarks
                            set by a higher court. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     While it is trite that lower courts are not
                    required to adhere slavishly to sentencing precedents and that each case
                    ultimately turns on its own facts (see <em>Viswanathan
                        Ramachandran v Public Prosecutor</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 435 at [43]
                    and <em>Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 10 at [45]), we would remind all sentencing judges that sentencing
                    precedents should not simply be departed from without adequate justification. As
                    V K Rajah JA held in <em>Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim
                        bin Buang</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 753 at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22     … The application of sentencing
                            principles to the factual matrix requires the judge to undertake a
                            critical examination and evaluation of the matter to justify the
                            legitimacy of the sentence passed. It is, after all, the court’s
                            reasoning that accords legitimacy to the sentence that is passed (see,
                                <em>eg</em>, <em>Angliss
                                Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653
                                (“<em>Angliss</em>”) at [24]).
                            While a judge must always remain sensitive to the facts of the case,
                            this is not, all said and done, a <em>carte
                                blanche</em> licence for a sentencing judge to pursue his own
                            penal philosophies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the present case, the Judge’s
                    sentence of ten years’ imprisonment was markedly lower than the
                    established sentencing range of 12 to 20 years’ imprisonment for robbery
                    cases involving death. While it is possible that the Judge might have been
                    influenced by the low sentence imposed in <em>Somrak
                        Senkham</em>, the DPP submitted that the sentence in that case was
                    anomalous and should not be followed. We agreed. It is necessary to point out
                    that in <em>Somrak Senkham</em>, no relevant sentencing
                    precedent was cited by the court. Although the judge in <em>Somrak Senkham</em> accepted at [7] of his Grounds of Decision that
                    the two accused had only intended to commit robbery and did not plan the
                    victim’s death, the DPP correctly pointed out that this was similarly the
                    situation in the other sentencing precedents cited above. If the respondents had
                    actually planned to kill the deceased in this case, they might well have been
                    charged with murder instead. In our view, <em>Somrak
                        Senkham</em> should not be used as a precedent for robbery cases
                    involving death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Turning to the facts of this case, we did not
                    see any special circumstances justifying a departure from the normal sentencing
                    range of 12 to 20 years’ imprisonment. On the contrary, we were perturbed
                    by the callous and wanton nature of the respondents in inflicting violence on
                    the deceased when there was no real need to do so. For the sake of satisfying
                    their urge to drink, the respondents and Ah Choi ended up causing the death of
                    an innocent person. The courts have long recognised gratuitous violence as
                    warranting a deterrent sentence: see <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Raffi Bin Jelan and Another</em> [2004] SGHC 120 at [21] and
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Leong Soon Kheong</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 63 at [55]. The rationale for this was explained by V K
                    Rajah J in <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em>
                    [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<em>Law Aik
                    Meng</em>”) at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    … Certain crimes, in addition to harming
                            their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of triggering
                            unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public. A
                            deterrent sentence is therefore necessary and appropriate to quell
                            public disquiet and the unease engendered by such crimes. … It is
                            critical that a crystal clear signal be conveyed through deterrent
                            sentences that all such offences causing public disquiet will be
                            unstintingly deplored and denounced by the courts. Instances of
                            gratuitous violence will also fall under this broad
                        category.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In this case, despite having the advantage of
                    number and the use of a dangerous weapon, the respondents and Ah Choi viciously
                    assaulted the deceased as a first resort and without warning when they could
                    have merely threatened him first and taken his money by force. Even after the
                    deceased was lying on the ground and unable to defend himself, the respondents
                    continued to kick and punch him mercilessly. Although the fatal injuries were
                    inflicted by Ah Choi with the metal rod, we did not consider the two respondents
                    any less responsible because they had clearly intended for the rod to be used in
                    the robbery. On the whole, we felt that the aggravating factors in this case far
                    outweighed the fact that both respondents had pleaded guilty and had no prior
                    antecedents. Accordingly, we were of the view that the Judge’s sentence
                    was manifestly inadequate. In our view, a sentence of 15 years’
                    imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane would serve as a more appropriate
                    warning that the courts would not hesitate to punish severely those who easily
                    resort to violence in committing robbery, especially in cases where innocent
                    lives are lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the imprisonment sentences against the second respondent
                should run consecutively</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is a general rule that where an accused is
                    convicted of wholly separate offences at the same trial, a court should order
                    any imprisonment sentences to run consecutively instead of concurrently. This is
                    the corollary of the one-transaction rule. The aggregate sentence of
                    imprisonment imposed should of course be tempered by the totality principle,
                    which requires that the overall punishment should be proportionate to the
                    gravity of the accused’s criminal conduct: <em>Maideen
                        Pillai v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 706 at [11];
                        <em>Law Aik Meng</em> at [58].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the present case, the Judge had justified
                    the imposition of concurrent sentences against the second respondent on the
                    ground that the total imprisonment term would be too harsh if the sentences were
                    to run consecutively. But, at the same time, the Judge also expressed the view
                    that he could have imposed a sentence slightly higher than ten years’
                    imprisonment against the second respondent on the common charge if the
                    prosecution had applied for the second charge to be taken into consideration
                    (“TIC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     With respect, we thought it incongruous of the
                    Judge to say that he could have imposed a higher sentence if the prosecution had
                    applied for the second charge to be “TICed”, and yet order the
                    sentences to run concurrently when the prosecution had proceeded on that charge
                    instead. As I stated in <em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em> at
                    [36], the increase in an offender’s sentence where other offences are TIC
                    would be lighter than the sentence he would receive if the prosecution had
                    proceeded with those other offences as well. Since the prosecution had chosen to
                    proceed with the second charge here instead of applying for it to be TIC, the
                    case for imposing a higher overall sentence on the second respondent was
                        <em>a fortiori</em>. We agreed with the DPP’s
                    submission that the effect of ordering concurrent sentences was that the second
                    respondent would essentially be getting off scot-free on the second charge when
                    it was committed at a different time and place and against a different victim.
                    We found this result untenable. Since the second respondent was convicted of
                    separate and unrelated offences, the imprisonment sentences against him should
                    have been ordered to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was, of course, possible for the Judge to
                    give effect to the totality principle by lowering the second respondent’s
                    sentence for the common charge and ordering it to run consecutively with the
                    sentence for the second charge. This would give rise to the disparity of the
                    second respondent being punished less than the first respondent for the first
                    offence, but this disparity could still be justified on the totality principle.
                    In <em>Public Prosecutor v McCrea Michael</em> [2006]
                    3 SLR(R) 677 (“<em>McCrea
                    Michael</em>”), the accused pleaded guilty to two charges of
                    culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Penal Code,
                    and one charge of causing the disappearance of evidence with the intention of
                    screening himself from legal punishment under s 201 of the Penal Code. He
                    was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment for each of the s 304(b)
                    offences and four years’ imprisonment for the s 201 offence, with all
                    three sentences to run consecutively. In earlier proceedings, the
                    accused’s accomplice had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 201
                    and was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for each of the charges. The
                    High Court noted this disparity but justified it on the basis of the totality
                    principle, since the accused in <em>McCrea Michael</em> was
                    facing two additional charges under s 304(b). Similarly here, the Judge
                    could have given effect to the totality principle by adjusting the individual
                    sentences to arrive at an appropriate overall sentence instead of simply
                    ordering them to run concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having said that, we felt that ordering wholly
                    consecutive sentences against the second respondent would not infringe the
                    totality principle on the facts of this case. It was clear from the
                    circumstances in which both his offences were committed that the second
                    respondent was a person who was prone to wanton violence. He was not afraid to
                    cause hurt to his victims as a first resort to satisfying his greed, even though
                    the items he robbed were of relatively minor value. He also continued to kick
                    and punch his victims in both cases when he could have easily made off with his
                    loot. Violence appeared to be an integral part of his <em>modus
                        operandi</em>. In the circumstances, we did not think that the
                    aggregate sentence of imprisonment imposed was disproportionate to the gravity
                    of his criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For the above reasons, we allowed the
                    prosecution’s appeal and increased both respondents’ sentences for
                    the common charge to 15 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of
                    the cane. We also ordered the imprisonment sentences against the second
                    respondent for the common charge and the second charge to run consecutively,
                    making a total of 20 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
