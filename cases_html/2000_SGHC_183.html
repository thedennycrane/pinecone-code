<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    The Plaintiffs are members of the

Defendants are the President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Association respectively. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    On 20 June 2000, the High Court

granted an injunction against the Defendants restraining them from convening with the

adjourned AGM for any or all the purposes set out in the notice dated 10 June 2000 unless

the following motions were tabled at the adjourned AGM and members were given notice of

the said motions:-</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) that the name of the Fourth Defendant in Mandarin be

  Fourth Defendant against the First to Third Defendants in their personal capacity.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    On 23 June 2000, the Defendants

applied for an injunction to restrain the Plaintiffs from proceeding with the adjourned

AGM until trial or further order.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    On 24 June 2000, the High Court made

an order in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(a) The adjourned annual general

  meeting will not proceed on 25 June 2000 as originally scheduled</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) The adjourned annual general meeting will be adjourned

  to a date to be fixed at such time as will allow sufficient notice under the Rules and

  Regulations to be given to all members and in any event the adjourned annual general

  meeting is to take place by 24 August 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) The First Defendant is to convene and hold the

  adjourned annual general meeting as the purported President of the Association and the

  First Defendant will chair the adjourned annual general meeting according to the Rules and

<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) All motions on record including those contained in the

  earlier Order of Court made on 20 June 2000, the earlier Order of Court is hereby varied

  accordingly.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    This Order of 24 June 2000 was then

amended to better reflect the intention of the court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    On 1 August 2000, the Defendants made

an application to court. The material part of the application sought: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) That the Order of Court dated 20 June 2000 and

  paragraph 4 of the Amended Order of Court dated 24 June 2000 be discharged;</font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Pending the hearing of this application, paragraph 2

  of the Amended Order of Court dated 24 June 2000 be suspended</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    This application was heard on an

urgent basis on 18, 19 and 21 August 2000 as the adjourned AGM was scheduled for 24 August

2000. On 21 August 2000, I dismissed the application and reserved costs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    The Defendants have appealed against

my decision.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p>
</i></u>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    On 15 November 1998, one Chew Tong

Shing had proposed at a Council meeting of the Association to change the name of the

Association from ‘She’ to ‘Gong Hui’ in Mandarin. This proposal was

not carried.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    Subsequently, the Association held

its Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 10 January 1999. The items on the agenda

did not include any proposal to change the name of the association. However, as was the

practice, members were allowed to write in if they wanted any matter to be discussed at

the AGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    Chew Tong Shing had written in to

propose the same change of the name of the Association.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    His proposal was put to the members

at this AGM and was carried by a majority of twenty-nine against twenty-three with four

spoilt votes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    On 25 January 1999, thirty-two

members of the Association wrote to the First Defendant requesting an Extraordinary

General Meeting (‘EGM’) to discuss the change of name and to set out their

reasons for their request. The request was made pursuant to Rule 21 of the

Association’s Rules &amp; Regulations (although it referred to Article 21 of the

Constitution).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    The First Defendant’s reply was

dated 22 March 1999. In essence, the request was rejected although this was put in an

indirect manner. He said that the request would be brought up for discussion at the next

Board of Directors’ meeting (meaning the next Council meeting) if the parties

requesting could put forward a more fair and sensible and legitimate proposal. The letter

also said that if these members were not satisfied, they could lodge their complaint with

the relevant authorities.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    By a letter dated 27 March 1999, M/s

James Chia &amp; Co, acting for thirty-two members (presumably the same thirty-two who had

requested the EGM), wrote to the Registrar of Societies (‘ROS’) stating that the

notice of the AGM was in violation of Rule 21 as it did not mention the issue about the

change of name. They sought ROS’s intervention to require the Council members to

convene an EGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    ROS replied on 23 April 1999 stating

that he was in no position to rule on whether the notice of AGM was in violation of Rule

21.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    ROS also pointed out that under Rule

21.1, an EGM could be convened in response to the written request of at least twenty

members of the Association and as the council had not acceded to the request, it was clear

what these members needed to do if they wanted an EGM to be convened.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    However, nothing else was done for

about a year.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    By a notice dated 17 March 200, two

members, Yu Da Shui (also spelt Yee Tar Swee) and Luo Huan Wen, gave notice of a motion to

repudiate the previous motion regarding the change of name. This notice was given so that

the motion could be tabled at the next AGM fixed for 26 March 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    This notice was followed by another

letter dated 23 March 2000 to amend the earlier notice to include four more words.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    By a letter also dated 23 March

2000, the First Defendant replied to the notice dated 17 March 2000. He pointed out, inter

alia, that the change of name had been decided upon at the last AGM. He said that that

decision was final. The letter also said that if these members were not satisfied, they

could proceed by legal means to establish that the change of name was illegal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    At the AGM on 26 March 2000,

pandemonium broke out.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    Yu Da Shui took exception to the

refusal to table the motion which he and another member had requested and the First

Defendant was asked to explain. Some members were protesting and cursing the First

Defendant and they sought to impeach him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    The First Defendant claimed that he

then adjourned the meeting and left. The Second and Third Defendants left with him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    The Defendants alleged that they did

not hear the First Defendant say anything about adjourning the meeting although he said

that he could no longer chair the meeting and left.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    The Defendants also alleged that

after the First to Third Defendants had left, the AGM repudiated the earlier change of

name in 1999, removed the First Defendant as President and elected the First Plaintiff as

President.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    By a letter dated 28 March 2000, the

First Defendant wrote to all Council members calling for a Council meeting on 5 April 2000

to discuss a date for the adjourned AGM held on 26 March 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    By a letter dated 20 March 2000, the

First Plaintiff wrote to the First Defendant stating that the latter was no longer the

Chairman and Director (meaning the President and Council member) of the Council as he had

been ousted on 26 March 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.    By a letter dated 4 April 2000,

fourteen Council members (out of twenty-three) wrote to the First Defendant stating that

the AGM held on 26 March 2000 was legally binding. Presumably they meant that the

resolutions purportedly passed after the Defendants had left the AGM were legally binding.

The letter also stated that there was no reason to attend the Council meeting convened by

the First Defendant for 5 April 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.    On 25 April 2000, the First

Defendant issued a notice calling for a Council meeting to be held on 3 May 2000 to

discuss fixing the date to hold the adjourned AGM. A note to this notice stated that

according to the practice of societies if such a meeting fails twice, then at the third

meeting, half an hour’s waiting time would be provided if there were insufficient

Council members, after which the meeting would proceed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.    In response, the First Plaintiff did

on 3 May 2000 summon an EGM of Council members to discuss various matters including the

confirmation of resolutions purportedly passed on 26 March 2000 regarding the change of

name of the Association from ‘Gong Hui’ back to ‘She’ and the removal

of the First Defendant as President and the election of the First Plaintiff as President.

One other item was to discuss the use of the funds of the Association by the First

Defendant or others who supported him to meet legal costs of matters arising out of the

AGM held on 26 March 2000. Another item was to declare that the notice of 25 April 2000

issued by the First Defendant invalid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    On 3 May 2000, the fireworks

continued. The First Defendant purported to chair and conduct the meeting which he had

called. He proposed the motion to fix the date of the adjourned AGM. The First Plaintiff

asked for a vote on the motion. The First Defendant rejected the need for a vote. However,

the First Plaintiff insisted on a vote and eleven Council members voted against the

adjourned AGM. It is not clear to me how many voted for the motion.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    The First Defendant then announced

that he was sacking the First Plaintiff and all those who had voted against having the

adjourned AGM for failing to comply with his direction as President. He tore the notice

dated 3 May 2000 from the First Plaintiff. He then called his meeting to a close.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.    The First Plaintiff then carried on

with the Council meeting which he had purportedly convened and resolutions were

purportedly carried out at this Council meeting in accordance with the First

Plaintiff’s notice dated 3 May 2000. The First Defendant and his supporters remained

in the vicinity but apparently did not participate in the First Plaintiff’s meeting.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    By a notice dated 9 May 2000, the

First Defendant summoned the dissenters to a disciplinary hearing on 17 and 18 May 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.    This led to the initiation of this

action on or about 17 May 2000. The Plaintiffs also sought an injunction to restrain the

Defendants from holding the disciplinary hearing until after trial or further order. The

High Court granted the injunction on 17 May 2000. This injunction is not the subject of

the subsequent application heard by me and I need say no more about it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.    Following this injunction, there

were further steps and correspondence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.    On 8 June 2000, the Ninth Plaintiff

discovered that the First to Third Defendants had issued or caused to be issued two

cheques for a total of $19,500 in favour of M/s Lourdes Chen &amp; Lee.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.    On 10 June 2000, the First Defendant

issued a notice to members of the Association to continue with the AGM held on 26 March

2000. The notice fixed the adjourned AGM on 25 June 2000. Under the Agenda, it was stated

that no resolution had been proposed by members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.    By a letter dated 14 June 2000, M/s

Hee Theng Fong &amp; Co (who act for the Plaintiffs) wrote to M/s Lourdes Chen &amp; Lee

(who act for the Defendants). They said that the fixing of the adjourned AGM on 25 June

2000 was contrary to the resolution of the Council on 3 May 2000 (at the meeting convened

by the First Plaintiff).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.    In any event, they proposed six

motions for the adjourned AGM. M/s Lourdes Chen &amp; Lee replied on 15 June 2000 and

rejected the request. One of the points that they took was that the adjourned AGM should

not include any new item.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.    As a consequence, the Plaintiffs

made another application to court. This was the application filed on or about 20 June 2000

seeking to restrain the Defendants from continuing with the adjourned AGM on 25 June 2000

unless the six motions were included at the adjourned AGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.    As I have mentioned, the Court did

on 20 June 2000 grant the order sought. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.    It is to be noted that this order

was a mandatory order in a limited sense. It only required the Defendants to table the six

motions if the Defendants were continuing with the adjourned AGM. Thus, if the Defendants

did not continue with the adjourned AGM, the six motions need not be tabled.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.    However, on 21 June 2000, the

Plaintiffs’ solicitors issued a notice to the members of the Association stating that

the (adjourned) AGM would be held on 25 June 2000 and setting out the six motions.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.    As a consequence, the Defendants

then applied on 23 June 2000 for an injunction to restrain the Plaintiffs from holding or

proceeding with the adjourned AGM until trial or further order.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.    The Defendants took the point that

the notice from the Plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 21 June 2000 was unconstitutional

and wrong for the following reasons:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Under Rule 21 of the Rules and Regulations, the

  general meeting can only be summoned by the President and no one else. Neither the

  Plaintiffs’ solicitors nor any of their clients not being the President of the

  Association have the power nor authority to call for the aforesaid general meeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Notice of the aforesaid general meeting must be given

  to members at least 2 weeks prior to the meeting. In this instance, the purported Notice

  does not have the pre-requisite notice period.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.    The Defendants said that since the

20 June 2000 order, they were not intending to hold the adjourned AGM (fixed for 25 June

2000) but had to apply to court to restrain the Plaintiffs from proceeding with it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.    Therefore, the parties had reversed

their positions. The Defendants who had wanted to proceed with the adjourned AGM on 25

June 2000 no longer wanted to do so and the Plaintiffs who had taken the position that

certain resolutions had already been passed now wanted the adjourned AGM to proceed

provided the six motions were tabled at the adjourned AGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.    On 24 June 2000, the High Court

restrained the Plaintiffs from proceeding with the adjourned AGM presumably in the light

of the technical objections raised by the Defendants. However, the court ordered that the

adjourned AGM be adjourned to a date no later than 24 August 2000. This was to enable

sufficient notice to be given to all members of the next meeting date and of the six

motions to be tabled.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.    The Court also ordered the First

Defendant to convene and hold the adjourned AGM as the purported President of the

Association.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.    Subsequently the order of 24 June

2000 was amended to reflect the court’s intention. The amendment is not material for

present purposes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.    Not being satisfied with the order

of 24 June 2000, the Defendants launched another counter-attack on 1 August 2000 by filing

the application to discharge the Order of Court dated 20 June 2000 and paragraph 4 of the

Amended Order dated 24 June 2000, alternatively that paragraph 4 of the Amended Order be

varied to exclude the six motions from being tabled at the adjourned AGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55.    At that time, notice of the meeting

of the adjourned AGM had still not been given by the First Defendant to the members of the

Association, no doubt because he had hoped that the Defendants’ application would be

successful before notice to members had to be given of the adjourned AGM and the six

motions to comply with the 24 August 2000 dead-line.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56.    When the application first came up

for hearing before me on 7 August 2000, the Defendants sought an adjournment to file an

affidavit or affidavits in response to those recently filed for the Plaintiffs on 5 August

2000 and an urgent hearing date thereafter. They also sought a suspension of the earlier

orders on 20 and 24 June 2000 regarding the dead-line to hold the meeting by 24 August

2000 pending the hearing of the application as the notice for the adjourned AGM had to be

given very soon to meet that dead-line.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.    I granted the Defendants an

adjournment and an urgent hearing date thereafter but did not order a suspension of the

earlier orders as to do so would effectively mean that the six motions would not be tabled

at the adjourned AGM on 24 August 2000 or that the adjourned AGM would not take place on

24 August 2000, thus circumventing the earlier orders even before I had heard the

application.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.    After all affidavits had been filed,

the application was heard on 18, 19 and 21 August 2000. On 21 August 2000, I dismissed the

application.</font></p>

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Defendants’ reasons for their

application before me</font></p>
</i></u>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.    The Defendants alleged that there

was deliberate and/or reckless non-disclosure of material facts by the Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.    Assuming that there was material

non-disclosure, the principles of law on the effect of such non-disclosure were not

disputed. They have been recently reiterated by the Court of Appeal in <i>Tay Long Kee

Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah t/a Sing Kwang Wah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=56771&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">(2000) 2 SLR 750.</a></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.    In brief, once material

non-disclosure is established, the court has a discretion to discharge the interlocutory

injunction. All the more so if it is deliberate. However, the court still retains a

residual discretion, in such circumstances, whether to continue the ex parte injunction or

to grant a fresh one.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.    The existence of this discretion

must not, of course, undermine the principle that it is the duty of a party who seeks an

ex parte application to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts, including

those which may be used against him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63.    It all depends on the nature of the

non-disclosure and the circumstances of each case and the test of the ‘lower risk of

injustice’ should be considered.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.    I would reiterate that the order of

24 June 2000 was not made on the Plaintiffs’ application but on the Defendants’

application although the order made that day was not what the Defendants had sought.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65.    Thus, the Plaintiffs had argued,

inter alia, that the Defendants were precluded from making the application which I heard

as they had already made an application which was heard by the court on 24 June 2000. On

the other hand, the Defendants said they had not had sufficient time to present full facts

and arguments as they were reacting to the order of 20 June 2000 and the Plaintiffs’

conduct of 21 June 2000 in stating that the meeting of 25 June 2000 would continue with

the six motions.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66.    While there was some similarity in

the two applications, I did not think that the Defendants were precluded from making the

application before me especially in view of the tight time frame in which they had to

react. However what they should have done was to alert the court then that in view of the

tight time frame, they were not able to file a more comprehensive affidavit and would seek

to do so some time in the near future with the view of presenting more arguments before

the court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67.    The Defendants’ first

allegation of non-disclosure was that the Plaintiffs were wrong to assert that the Chinese

version of the Rules and Regulations of the Association takes precedence over the English

version. The argument was that the Plaintiffs had failed to disclose that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(i) only the English version of the

  Rules and Regulations are approved by the Registrar of Societies;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) the Chinese version of the Rules and Regulations are

  translated from the approved English version and that todate, there are at least 4

  unofficial Chinese versions;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) under the Societies Act, the Association’s

  Rules have (<i>sic</i>) to be prior approved by the Registrar and that only the English

  version is approved;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) (<i>sic</i>) purporting to remove the President of

  the Association under the Chinese version of the Rules when the official English version

  only provides for censure;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) (<i>sic</i>) purporting to validate the convening of

  the Extraordinary Council Meeting on 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2000 by the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Plaintiff and his other 10 Council Members (the other 10 Plaintiffs) under the Chinese

  version of the Rules when the official English version does not give them such powers or

  authority.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68.    The Defendants seemed to think that

because the English version of the Rules and Regulations is approved by the ROS, that

version must necessarily prevail. I did not agree.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69.    There was also a dispute as to

whether the Chinese version was translated from the English version or vice versa.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70.    The fact that there were four

Chinese versions was neither here nor there because the material parts of the Chinese

versions were not inconsistent inter se. Furthermore, the existence of the four Chinese

versions did not necessarily mean that they were all translated from the English version

first.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71.    As regards the Defendants’

argument that the English version provided for censure of the President, contrary to the

Chinese version, the English version states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘6. GENERAL MEETING</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">General Meeting is the highest authority

  of the Association which has the power to pass or revise the Rules and Regulations of the

  Association, to elect the officer-bearers, to supervise, censure the Presidents and

  Offices Bearers as well as approve the annual budget, to propose or adopt all the

  proposals aimed at developing the Association.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72.    The English translation of the

Chinese version states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Article 7: General Meeting:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">General Meeting is the highest authority

  of the association. It can adopt or amend the Constitution of this association, monitor,

  impeach the Chairman and Directors, approve the Annual Budget as well as propose and adopt

  all proposals for the development of our association.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73.    Leaving aside the difference in

numbering between the two versions which did not appear material to the parties, the

Defendants argued that the English version only allowed censure of the President whereas

the English translation of the Chinese version allowed him to be impeached.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74.    In so far as the Defendants were

relying on non-disclosure on this point, I did not accept their argument. The Plaintiffs

did disclose both the English version and the Chinese version (and the English translation

thereof). Indeed the English version is in the first page of the exhibits to the first

affidavit filed for the Plaintiffs on 17 May 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">75.    The Plaintiffs took the position

that the Chinese version superceded the English version and although the Defendants

disagreed, this point, if still material, could be resolved by the court later but it did

not mean that the Plaintiffs must accept the Defendants’ position.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76.    However, there was a more important

consideration. Both sides thought that the President could only be removed under the

Chinese version because it used the word ‘impeach’ instead of

‘censure’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77.    I was of the view that neither of

these words allow the General Meeting to remove the President. All the arguments over the

English and Chinese version were therefore unnecessary.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78.    However, as the General Meeting had

power to elect office-bearers, I was of the view that it must also have the implied power

to remove such office-bearers, see Halsbury’s Laws of England (Fourth Edition) Volume

9 at para 1266 and <i>Chen Cheng &amp; Anor v Central Church &amp; another</i> (1996) 1

SLR 313.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79.    Furthermore, the General Meeting is

the highest authority of the Association which has the power to pass or revise the Rules

and Regulations of the Association. Accordingly, it could pass a resolution to remove the

President as an ad hoc revision of the Rules and Regulations.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80.    The purpose of such a provision was

to allow the General Meeting to do anything, within the law, provided adequate notice had

been given to all members. The concern about adequate notice was already addressed by the

court when it postponed the adjourned AGM to a date not later than 24 August 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81.    The argument about the validating of

the convening of the Extraordinary Council Meeting on 3 May 2000 by the First Plaintiff

was not a material argument.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82.    The second and third grounds of

complaint by the Defendants about non-disclosure were that the Plaintiffs:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘b) has asserted that Mr Chew Tong

  Shing attended the Council Meeting on 15 November 1998 when he (<i>sic</i>) not a council

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83.    I did not think it was material that

Chew Tong Shing was an Honorary Advisor. Furthermore, I had some doubt as to whether as

Honorary Advisor he was ‘entitled’ to attend a Council meeting. In any event,

whether he was entitled to attend or not was also not material. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84.    The crux of the Plaintiffs’

complaint regarding the background, and as stated in the 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit of 17

May 2000, was that a motion to change the name of the Association was tabled in the 1999

AGM without adequate notice to members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85.    This brings me to the third ground

of complaint of non-disclosure.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86.    The Plaintiffs did not inform the

court that the manner in which the motion (to change the name of the Association) was

tabled in the 1999 AGM was the way in which any other motion, not already on the agenda,

was tabled i.e any member could give notice of his intended motion by a dead-line and that

motion would be put up on a white board at an AGM for all attending members to see and

subsequently discuss and vote thereon. This was not a satisfactory procedure as other

members who did not attend the AGM would not know of any new motion being proposed by any

member. However that was the practice.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87.    Indeed, in 1991, a change of name

was proposed and carried out in the same manner.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88.    Plaintiffs’ Counsel submitted

that the change in name in 1991 was not a material change whereas in 1999 it was a

material change.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">89.    However that was not the point. The

point was whether the practice of the Association had been followed for the change of name

in 1999. Apparently it was, whereas the Plaintiffs had given the impression that it was

not and that the events leading to the change in 1999 were done in some sort of

surreptitious manner.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">90.    I found that the omission was

material in the context of how the Plaintiffs had painted the Defendants out to be. Even

if it was not deliberate as there was obviously much sound and fury, it was reckless.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91.    However, Plaintiffs’ Counsel

submitted that the court was still correct in granting the mandatory injunctions on 20 and

24 June 2000 because the Plaintiffs were not relying so much on the alleged unconscionable

conduct of the Defendants but on the right of members to decide anything, within the law,

at an AGM. In other words, whether the Defendants had acted within the practice of the

Association or not regarding the change of name in 1999, it was open to the AGM to pass

yet another resolution in the year 2000 to change the name back to its pre-1999 name. I

agreed. Notwithstanding the Plaintiffs’ non-disclosure, the court would have allowed

the motion on the change of name to be tabled at the next AGM. In any event, I was

prepared to allow this.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92.    The fourth ground of alleged

non-disclosure was that the Plaintiffs had asserted:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘d) that the Defendants have breached

  the rules of Regulations of the Association in rejecting the request of 32 of its members

  for (<i>sic</i>) a EOGM to repudiate the earlier resolution for the change of name and

  that the Defendants have thus acted improperly and wrongfully when they knew at all times

  and have failed to disclose that ….:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) a Council Meeting was held on 14<sup>th</sup> March

    1999 whereby it was the collective decision to ask the 32 members to clarify and

    substantiate their request to the Council before the Council would consider it and that as

    such, at no time was the request refused as alleged;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) a total of six of the Plaintiffs were present in the

    said Council Meeting held on 14<sup>th</sup> March 1999 where this decision was reached;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs

    have now filed an affidavit on 5<sup>th</sup> August 2000 to affirm that the Council never

    rejected the 32 member’s request (see paragraph 5 therein);</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) in any event, it is the Defendant’s submission

    that the 32 member’s request is called to suspicion because (a) 5 of the

    member’s signature are different from the Association’s records; and (b) 9 of

    the member’s records cannot be traced ….’ </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">93.    I was of the view that the request

was effectively refused (see paragraph 15 above).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94.    Also, the real reason for the

rejection was not any suspicion of the authenticity of certain signatures.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95.    The Defendants’ main argument

on this ground was that it was for the Council members to convene an EGM of members and

the Council had decided not to do so (although apparently this was not a unanimous

decision).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">96.    The basis of the Defendants’

main argument was Rule 21.2. The English version states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘2. Council Meeting --- Council

  Meeting shall be held once very two months. The Council Meeting shall be summoned by the

  President. If necessary, an <u>Extraordinary General Meeting of Members</u> may be

  convened in response (<i>sic</i>) of the written requests of at least one-third <u>of the

  Council members</u>. Fourteen members of the Council members shall form a quorum. Notice

  of Council Meeting shall be given to members not less than one week before the date of the

  Meeting together with the agenda by the president. If the number of members present is

  insufficient to form a quorum, a time grace of half an hour will be given. If there are

  still insufficient members to form a quorum, the Meeting shall be adjourned to another

  date.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">97.    The Defendants said that under Rule

21.2, the thirty-two members were not entitled to call for an EGM of members and only

one-third of the Council members could do so.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">98.    The Plaintiffs on the other hand

said that the Chinese version of Clause 21.2 allowed members to call an EGM of members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">99.    In my view, the parties had again

made much over the wrong provision.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">100.    The relevant provision was Rule

21.1 (and not 21.2) which, even under the English version (which was relied upon by the

Defendants), states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Rules No. 21 - Meeting</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. General Meeting - annual General

  Meeting shall be held once a year in January/February. The Meeting shall be summoned by

  the president. Whenever necessary, <u>an extraordinary General meeting may be convened in

  response (<i>sic</i>) of the written requests (<i>sic</i>) by at least twenty members of

  the Association</u>. At least fifty members shall form a quorum for a General Meeting. Two

  week prior to the date of the Annual General Meeting and the extraordinary General

  Meeting, notice shall be given to the members together with the agenda by the President.

  In the event of there being no quorum present at a General Meeting, one hour grace will be

  given. If there is still an absence of quorum after the one-hour-grace, the meeting shall

  still be convened irrespective of the absence of the quorum, however, they have no power

  to alter, amend or make additions to any of the existing Rules and Regulations.’</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">101.    I would add that the ROS had

already drawn attention to Rule 21.1 (and not 21.2) when he replied on 23 April 1999 to a

letter sent by the Plaintiffs (see paragraph 18 above).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">102.    Therefore that part of Rule 21.2,

which was relied upon by the Defendants, was clearly an error. It applied not to EGMs of

members but of Council members and two-thirds of the Council members may request an EGM of

Council members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">103.    In any event, even if the

Defendants were correct about members not being entitled to call for an EGM of members,

this was immaterial. The Plaintiffs were not seeking a mandatory injunction to hold an EGM

in 1999. They had waited one year till 2000 to table a motion for the change of name at

the next AGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">104.    The fifth ground of non-disclosure

relied on by the Defendants did not apply to the application before me and so it was not

pursued by Defendants’ Counsel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">105.    The sixth ground of non-disclosure

relied on by the Defendants was that the Plaintiffs had asserted:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘f) that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant

  (<i>sic</i>) have acted improperly and wrongfully in refusing the inclusion of the motion

<blockquote xmlns="">

    the same;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) the Council meeting could not go on as there was (<i>sic</i>)

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">106.    The main crux of the

Defendants’ argument on this point was that any motion proposed to be tabled at an

AGM was still subject to approval by the President. They said that this was the practice

although apparently the President had never exercised this veto power before.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">107.    In my view, the Defendants have not

established that the President has a veto power by practice which, if established, would

mean that he can prevent a motion from being considered by members simply by exercising

that power.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">108.    I would add that the Council also

had no power to prevent a motion from being put before the AGM if it was properly raised.

Therefore the omission to mention what had transpired at the Council meeting to consider

the motion from Yee Tar Swee was not a material omission in any event.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">109.    The seventh ground of

non-disclosure alleged by the Defendants was that the Plaintiffs had asserted:</font></p>

  with the general meeting on 26<sup>th</sup> March 2000 to validly pass all the

  resolutions, the subject of which is comprised, inter alia, in the six motions which is

</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">110.    The short answer to this objection

is that the court had by its orders of 20 and 24 June 2000 directed that the adjourned AGM

be convened by 24 August 2000 so that all the members could be given adequate notice of

the six motions. In other words, it was like a new AGM. The six motions to be tabled at

the adjourned AGM included the three motions which were purportedly passed on 26 March

2000 regarding:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) the change of name back to the pre-1999 name,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the removal of the First Defendant as President,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) the election of the First Plaintiff as President.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">111.    The fourth motion was to ratify

what was done at the AGM of 24 June 2000 after the AGM was allegedly adjourned.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">112.    It was therefore for the members to

decide at the adjourned AGM whether they wanted those three motions to be carried or not

and put an end to the objections raised regarding the passing of the three motions on 26

March 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">113.    I have already dealt with the

question whether the General Meeting can remove the President and need only address one

other argument of the Defendants on this point.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">114.    The Defendants argued that the

General Meeting only had power to elect Council Members who would then elect among

themselves the officials of the Association. Even if that was true, I have already

mentioned that the General Meeting is the highest authority of the Association. It can

pass whatever resolution it wants, within the law, and provided sufficient notice is given

to all members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">115.    The eighth ground of non-disclosure

alleged by the Defendants was that the Plaintiffs had asserted:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘h) that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff

  is capable of calling (<i>sic</i>) a Extraordinary Council Meeting on the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  May 2000 to pass and ratify essentially all the resolutions which were passed at the

  general meeting held on 26<sup>th</sup> March 2000 and chaired by Mr Yee Tar Swee when

  they knew at all times and failed to disclose that….:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) under the Association’s Rules and Regulations,

    only the President can call for a Council Meeting and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff being

    only a vice-president of the Association does not have such powers or authority;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) all the eleven Plaintiffs have attended the Council

    Meeting chaired by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and have partook in the same until the 1<sup>st</sup>

    Defendant closed the Council Meeting after having finished all the business on the agenda,

    whereupon, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff then proceeded to purportedly hold his own Council

    Meeting thereafter amongst eleven of the Council members only, who are the Plaintiffs

    herein;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) the Council Meeting purportedly chaired by the 1<sup>st</sup>

    Plaintiff lacked the necessary quorum of 14 Council members….’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">116.    This allegation depends on whether

the First Defendant was still President after 26 March 2000 which in turn depended on

whether the three motions purportedly passed that day were valid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">117.    In my view, whether the First

Plaintiff was in a position to call an Extraordinary Council Meeting on 3 May 2000 or not

is immaterial. The court had directed that the adjourned AGM scheduled for 25 June 2000 be

postponed to another date no later than 24 August 2000 so that all members could receive

sufficient notice of the six motions and not because the First Plaintiff had validly

called an Extraordinary Council Meeting on 3 May 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">118.    The ninth ground of alleged

non-disclosure did not pertain to the application before me.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">119.    The Defendants also argued that the

six motions would perpetrate the wrongful and unconstitutional acts of the Plaintiffs on

26 March 2000. I did not agree. The first four of the six motions, when tabled at the

adjourned AGM on 24 August 2000, were to put an end to the argument whether the

resolutions passed on 26 March 2000 had been validly passed. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">120.    The Defendants also argued that no

reason was given to repudiate the earlier motion in 1999 on the change of name and to do

so in 2000 would disregard the wishes of the members who attended the AGM in 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">121.    This was an argument without merit.

No reason needs to be given for any resolution although the reality is that reasons would

probably be given at the meeting if the proposers hope to have it passed then.

Furthermore, a subsequent meeting, properly convened, can always make decisions

superceding what had been decided earlier, leaving aside third parties’ rights for

the time being.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">122.    It is ironical that the Defendants

should argue that the wishes of the members who attended the 1999 AGM would be

disregarded.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">123.    In the first place, not all the

1999 members were aware that a motion would be proposed in 1999 to change the name. Only

those who attended the 1999 AGM were aware. Indeed that was the crux of the

Plaintiffs’ complaint (even though the manner in which the motion was put to the 1999

AGM was in accordance with the practice of the Association).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">124.    With the adjourned AGM being held

by 24 August 2000, sufficient notice would be given to all members, and not just to those

who attended the 1999 AGM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">125.    In addition, as Plaintiffs’

Counsel had stressed, the Plaintiffs were not asking the court to compel the members to

vote for or against any particular motion but simply to allow the six motions to be

tabled.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">126.    It was the Defendants who were

seeking to avoid the wishes of the members by raising various technical objections to stop

the six motions from being tabled.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">127.    The Defendants’ argument that

the Association had conducted its business based on the change in name in 1999 is also

without merit. A further change in name, even if it is with retrospective effect, has no

effect on transactions already entered into by the Association.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">128.    I now come to the Defendants’

objections to the fifth and sixth motions being tabled.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">129.    As regards the fifth motion, the

Defendants said that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘- the motion is ultra vires and

  wrongful as under the Rules and Regulations, the President has powers to approve expenses

  up to the limit of $20,000.00 and the said expenditure of $19,500.00 was duly approved by

  the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant acting under the powers given to him as the President ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- the expenditure is properly expended

  with valid supporting vouchers and documents duly approved by all the relevant office

  bearers of the Association;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- the motion is wrongful as the 1<sup>st</sup>

  to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were in this instance sued in the capacity of their office in

  the Association and not in their respective personal capacity and that accordingly, the 1<sup>st</sup>

  to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants are entitled to an implied indemnity in law ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- the motion is wrongful as the

  Association is also a Defendant in this action and would therefore have to be liable for

  legal costs incurred herein;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- the Council Meeting on the 16<sup>th</sup>

  August 2000 has already passed the resolution to approve the utilization of the (<i>sic</i>)

  Associations funds for this action up to the limit of $50,000.00 in accordance with the

  powers given under the Rules and Regulations of the Association;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- the Court has on 12<sup>th</sup> July

  2000 refused to make the Order on the (<i>sic</i>) Plaintiffs application to injunct the

  Defendants from utilizing funds belonging to the Association for the purposes of this

  Suit;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- there is no basis in fact or in law as

  disclosed in the Plaintiffs’ affidavits filed herein to substantiate their allegation

  that the utilization of the $19,500.00 was improper.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">130.    I was of the view that the point

was not so much whether the President had power to approve such an expense and so on but

whether the use of the funds for the purpose mentioned was an abuse of power.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">131.    It may well be that the use of

funds was not wrongful. In any event, that was a question for the court to decide.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">132.    However if the Plaintiffs wanted to

make a point at an AGM I did not see why they should be stopped from doing so.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">133.    As for the Defendants’

argument that the court did refuse on 12 July 2000 to injunct the Defendants from using

the Association’s funds for the suit, that did not stop members from putting the

question up for discussion and voting on it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">134.    As regards the sixth motion, the

Defendants argued that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘- The Court has already by way of an

  earlier order changed the action into a representative action and thus this motion is

  redundant and academic;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- The Association is also a party to both

  actions as the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants (<i>sic</i>) as thus this motion is redundant and

  academic;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">- The statement of claim as filed herein

  clearly shows that the nature of this action against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>

  Defendants herein are in their capacity as office bearers of the Association and not in

  their personal capacity and thus this motion is wrongful.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">135.    Again I was of the view that if the

Plaintiffs wanted to table the sixth motion for consideration by the members, they should

not be stopped. Indeed they run the risk that if the members reject the motion, then their

representative action might be in jeopardy.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">136.    I was also informed that the

Plaintiffs intended to apply for the Association to be added as a co-plaintiff and to be

deleted as a defendant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">137.    As regards whether the First to

Third Defendants should be sued in their personal capacity, any motion passed on this

point was not binding on the court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">138.    It appeared to me that the fifth

and sixth motions were introduced to give moral support to the Plaintiffs and to condemn

the Defendants and not so much because they had any legal effect.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">139.    The Defendants also argued that the

six motions were sub-judice. I did not agree. If they were right, no mandatory injunction

could ever be granted because of the argument that the subject matter of the injunction

was before the court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">140.    At the end of the day, I also had

to take into account the fact that three of the motions had already been purportedly

passed. There was a dispute whether they had been validly passed and pending the

resolution of the dispute both camps were acting on different bases. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">141.    The name of the Association was

being disputed. The Defendants acted on the basis that it had not been changed back to the

pre-1999 name whereas the Plaintiffs acted on the basis that it had.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">142.    Furthermore, the First Defendant

was acting on the basis that he was still the President while the First Plaintiff was

acting on the basis that he was the new President.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">143.    The main arguments of the

Defendants against these motions were technical and could be resolved by having them

tabled and voted on again at the adjourned AGM provided sufficient notice was given. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">144.    Presumably the court on 20 and 24

June 2000 was of the view that the best way to resolve these disputes was by letting the

members decide rather than let this unsatisfactory state of affairs continue any longer.

Notwithstanding all the arguments vigorously raised by the Defendants before me, I agreed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">145.    The fourth motion followed the

first three. The fifth and sixth motions were additional ones. As there was going to be an

adjourned AGM with sufficient notice being given to all members anyway, I did not think I

should divorce the fifth and sixth motions from the first four.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">146.    If the six motions tabled have been

carried and if I should be wrong in my tentative conclusions, the resolutions can always

be set aside by order of court. There is no irreparable damage. In that event, the name of

the Association would be changed to the post January 1999 name and the First Defendant

would be reinstated with retrospective effect as the President until such time as he

retires from office. He has no particular benefit such as a source of income from holding

the position. The extent of the injury to him would have been a slap in the face if the

motion to remove him has been passed. However, if that resolution is subsequently set

aside by order of court, he would be vindicated to the extent of the reason(s) for setting

aside the resolution.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">147.    Likewise for the third and fourth

motions and for the fifth and sixth motions which affect the other Defendants as well.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">148.    There is another point I would wish

to make.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">149.    Neither side was entirely

blameless. However, the First Defendant, as the principal office bearer, and by reason of

his conduct in trying to shut out the motion to change the name as well as his replies

telling certain members that they could lodge their complaint with the relevant

authorities or to proceed by legal means if they were not satisfied (see paragraphs 15 and

22 above), must take the lion’s share of the responsibility for this sad state of

affairs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">150.    In any event, both camps should be

acting in the interest of members and the Association but the reality was that each camp

wanted to have its own face. The disputes could and should have been resolved with more

give-and-take from each camp.</font></p>
