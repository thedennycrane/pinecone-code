I provide the reasons for my decision to explain that my doing so is not to be construed as a broad invitation for bankrupt persons who are dissatisfied with the OA’s determination to apply for a review. Instead, as I will explain, the OA did not do anything particularly wrong in the present case. Instead, the OA’s determination was primarily constrained by its interpretation of the IRDA, which resulted in a key deductible for rental expenses not to be reflective of the claimant’s actual situation.

</div> First, when the OA sent the claimant the Second Determination, there were no reasons set out in the document. Second, the MC in the Second Determination remains too high for the claimant to meet. Third, while the claimant had provided the OA with further information after the conclusion of SUM 1686, the OA did not appear to have taken this information into account in arriving at the Second Determination. Fourth, the claimant is of the view that the OA should have engaged him further and tried to understand his personal circumstances better before issuing the Second Determination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision: the application is allowed in part</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The general framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Mirmohammadali</span><span class="font-italic"> Hadian v Ambika d/o Ramachandran (Official Assignee, non-party)</span> [2023] SGHC 116 (“<span class="font-italic">Mirmohammadali</span>”) (at [28]), I explained that the consideration of an application under s 340(1) of the IRDA to review the OA’s determination of the MC and TC should proceed in the following two stages:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, has the OA shown that he has complied with the mandatory requirement of considering the factors in s 339(2)? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the OA has shown that he had considered the factors in s 339(2), then does the determination reached pursuant to s 339(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) withstand review under the perversity standard? By this standard, the question to be asked is whether the OA’s decision is so absurd that no OA properly advised or properly instructing himself could have so acted. If the answer to this question is yes, then the OA’s determination should be varied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The OA is not obliged to provide reasons in the Notice of Determination nor engage with a bankrupt </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Before I come to the reasons for allowing the application, I make an important preliminary point. This is that the OA is not obliged to provide reasons for his determination in the Notice of Determination issued pursuant to r 38(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Bankruptcy) Regulations 2020 (the “BR”). In this regard, r 38 of the BR provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Notice, etc., of determination of monthly contribution and target contribution</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">38.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—(1)  The notice of the determination of a bankrupt’s monthly contribution and target contribution which is required to be served under section 339(1)(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">) of the Act must be in Form BR</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">-7.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The explanation of a trustee in bankruptcy’s basis for making a determination which is required to be served under section 339(3) of the Act must be in Form BR-8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Importantly, while r 38(2) refers to a trustee in bankruptcy’s “basis for making a determination”, no reference is made to the OA’s basis for the same. This flows from s 339 of the IRDA, the title of which concerns the “[d]etermination of monthly contribution and target contribution”. More specifically, s 339(3) expressly provides that “[w]here the determination [of the MC and TC] … is made by a <span class="font-italic">trustee in bankruptcy</span>, the trustee must also serve notice of the determination, <span class="font-italic">together with an explanation on the basis </span>for making the determination … on the [OA]” [emphasis added]. This in turn flows from s 42(1) of the IRDA, which provides for the OA “to take cognizance of the conduct of a trustee in bankruptcy in the administration of the estate of a bankrupt”. Thus, it must follow that the OA needs to be furnished with the basis of the trustee in bankruptcy’s determination so as to “take cognizance” of this particular aspect of the trustee’s administration of the bankrupt’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Because the OA is not subject to any such general supervision in its administration of the bankrupt’s estate, it follows that the OA does not come under a similar duty to provide the basis for its determination of the MC and TC under s 339(1) of the IRDA. Therefore, the OA does not need to provide reasons in the Notice of Determination issued to the bankrupt. Further, if the bankrupt (or any creditor of the bankrupt) applies to the court under s 340(1) of the IRDA to review the determination made under s 339 (including one made by the OA), r 121(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Personal Insolvency) Rules 2020 only obliges a “trustee of a bankrupt’s estate … [to] file in court an explanation of the basis for making the determination”. Therefore, even when a bankrupt (or creditor) initiates a review under s 340(1), the OA is not technically obliged to provide reasons for his determination in the Notice of Determination, even if this is a good practice so that the court can properly evaluate the merits of the application before it. This must also mean that the OA has no corresponding obligation to engage with a bankrupt, much less consult with him or her, in the course of making its determination of the MC and TC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Therefore, in so far as the claimant bases this application on the OA’s lack of explanation or engagement, that must be rejected. In my view, the OA should not be saddled with the onerous burden of providing reasons in every determination and engaging with each and every bankrupt. This is because, unlike a trustee in bankruptcy who comes under the OA’s supervision in the administration of the bankrupt’s estate, the OA is presumed to have the professional competence to discharge its duties. Moreover, if the bankrupt is dissatisfied with the OA’s determination, there remains the recourse to the courts pursuant to s 340(1) of the IRDA, albeit with no technical requirement that the OA explains the basis for determination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The OA has considered the relevant factors under s 339(2) of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Having discussed this preliminary point, I return to the two-stage framework in <span class="font-italic">Mirmohammadali</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In relation to the first stage, I further explained in <span class="font-italic">Mirmohammadali</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [27]) that the OA has to demonstrate that he has taken into account the factors in s 339(2) of the IRDA. However, how the OA can do this will differ from case to case. In particular, I suggested that the OA need not show that he has considered the factors in any great detail. It suffices for the OA to briefly show that he has considered the factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 With this standard in mind, I reject the claimant’s very technical reading of what is required of the OA to show that he has considered the prescribed factors in s 339(2) of the IRDA. For example, the claimant contends that the OA erred in saying that a “real risk of losing one’s job” cannot be factored into the determination of the net income because “section 339(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the [IRDA] provides for a total of <span class="font-italic">no less than 6 factors</span> that the OA has to consider” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added],

Rather, a court need only be satisfied that the OA had considered the factors on a broad reading of the Explanation concerned. There is no need, as the claimant has attempted to suggest here, to undertake a detailed examination and assessment of the OA’s reasoning process. This is not the function or purpose of the review by a court under s 340(1) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As such, I am satisfied from a broad reading of the Explanation that the OA has considered the factors listed in s 339(2) of the IRDA.

Be that as it may, it can reasonably be inferred from Mr Jason Cheng’s (“Jason”) email dated 15 April 2023 that there may not be such a formal agreement. This is because Jason was in effect setting out the “arrangement” between the parties in the email after a discussion “on the phone”. This shows that the parties do not have a formal agreement between them and Jason, who is presumably the applicant’s boss at DTC World Corporation Pte Ltd, has a rather free hand in varying the terms of the applicant’s consultancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear from the above that all I had said was that the OA “should take into account the unstable and uncertain nature of the [claimant’s] current source of income”.

Moreover, I agree with the OA that if the claimant were to lose his current job, it is open to him to apply under s 342(1) of the IRDA for the OA to adjust his MC due to “personal circumstances of a non-transient nature that have substantially reduced his income” (see, in particular, the ground mention in s 342(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA).

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[$2,400 (the bankrupt’s half share of the monthly rent of $4,800.00) less $630.30 (the housing deductible comprised in the personal deductible)] x 16 months (September 2023 to December 2024) = $28,315.20. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the repayment plan is for a period of 52 months, the sum of $28,315.20 has been apportioned equally over the [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] that period and rounded up to $544.60. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I understand the OA’s explanation, which is that he has no statutory power to provide for the MC to be stepped up after the expiry of the tenancy agreement. To that extent, I do not think it would be fair to characterise the OA’s decision as “perverse”, since he is keeping within his statutory powers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Despite this, the <span class="font-italic">reality </span>of this determination is that the claimant would be severely compromised in the period until the tenancy agreement expires on 2 January 2025. First, the claimant would <span class="font-italic">actually </span>need to pay all or a substantial portion of the actual monthly rent of $4,800, which would be far beyond the $544.60 deductible that he has been allowed. As such, the OA’s assessment that the claimant’s disposable income is $4,698.85 based on a deductible of $544.60 for the rent over the next 52 months does not reflect reality because it ignores that the claimant has committed to paying a monthly rent of $4,800 <span class="font-italic">now</span>. Second, it is also not realistic to divide the monthly rent of $4,800 equally between the claimant and his spouse when his spouse’s income barely covers half of the monthly rent. Instead, the reality of the situation is that the claimant is bound to pay a substantial majority or even all of the monthly rent of $4,800. This is especially so if the spouse is expected to contribute most, if not all, of her monthly income of $2,800 towards family expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, as I have said above, because the OA legitimately regards that he does not have the power to cater for a “step-up MC plan”, I do not regard his decision to be “perverse”. But the potential injustice and inequity of this determination cannot be ignored.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It is just and equitable to adjust the deductible for rental expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Although the OA does not have the power to cater for a “step-up MC plan”, I find that the court can do this. This is because, pursuant to s 341(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 341(1) of the IRDA, the court may “make such order as it thinks fit to vary the bankrupt’s monthly contribution and target contribution” if “it is otherwise just and equitable” to do so. In my view, it is just and equitable to vary the MC and TC to take into account the fact that the claimant has entered into a tenancy agreement until 2 January 2025. It is also possible for the court to order a “step-up MC plan” because of the breadth of s 341(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As such, pursuant to s 341(1) of the IRDA, I increase the extraordinary deductible for rental expenses from $544.60 to $4,169.70 until 2 January 2025, which is when the claimant’s existing tenancy agreement will lapse. In my view, taken in the round, if the claimant’s spouse is expected to devote most, if not all, of her monthly income towards family expenses, then it is only fair to regard the claimant as being responsible for all of the monthly rent of $4,800. The eventual figure of $4,169.70 takes into account the OA’s allowance of $630.30 under the claimant’s personal deductibles to account for “housing”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Accordingly, I reduce the claimant’s MC from the date of this decision to 2 January 2025 by $3,625.10, which reflects the additional amount to the existing deductible of $544.60 for rental expenses, less the $630.30 that the OA has already allowed for housing. The claimant’s MC will therefore be $4,004.90 until 2 January 2025, at which time it will be reassessed to take into account the claimant’s new rental arrangements. Given the future change in the MC, the TC would accordingly be fluid for the time being, before becoming more certain after 2 January 2025. I, however, do not see this as an impediment to revising the MC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 There are three further directions that I would include with this revised MC of $4,004.90. First, should the claimant apply to the OA for a reduction of the MC and TC under s 342(1) of the IRDA before 2 January 2025, his contribution to the rent should be reassessed, with a corresponding adjustment to the MC until 2 January 2025. Second, the claimant is to inform the OA of his new rental arrangements after 2 January 2025 by 16 December 2024, so as to provide the OA with sufficient time to determine his MC after 2 January 2025 with that factor in mind. Should the claimant require more time, he can write in to seek the same from the OA. Needless to say, the claimant should adjust his lifestyle in his next tenancy. I emphasise once again that I am only making the present order because the claimant is tied to the existing tenancy agreement and cannot terminate it without incurring substantial costs. Third, while the claimant is entitled to challenge the OA’s determination of the MC and TC after 2 January 2025, I would highlight that he would not have succeeded in the present application had the OA not been constrained by his interpretation of the relevant legislative provisions. Indeed, it would not be fruitful for the claimant to focus on the <span class="font-italic">minutiae </span>of details because the review process under s 340(1) of the IRDA is not meant to be an appeal mechanism for a dissatisfied bankrupt to challenge each and every aspect of the OA’s determination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For all the reasons above, I allow the claimant’s application in part and revise his MC to be $4,004.90 until 2 January 2025, at which time it will be reassessed. However, I emphasise that this is not because I have found the OA’s Second Determination to be in any way falling short of the “perversity standard” of review. Instead, I find that the OA was constrained by the legislative provisions in arriving at the Second Determination. In fairness to the claimant, I have varied his MC until 2 January 2025 to reflect the reality that he has entered into a tenancy agreement that expires on that date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Given that this order is not the norm, but which I am satisfied is permissible under s 341(1) of the IRDA and, more importantly, necessary to effect justice and equity in the present case, the parties are at liberty to write in for clarifications if needed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sim Puay Jain Edwin and Faith Tan Fen Yi (Lexton Law Corporation) for the claimant;<br/>Lim Yew Jin and Christopher Eng Chee Yang (Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee’s Office) for the official assignee.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
