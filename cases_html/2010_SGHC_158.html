<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Mr Luyono Lam (“the
                    Appellant”) against his total sentence of eight months’
                    imprisonment after being convicted of three counts of moving cash of more than
                    the prescribed amount of $30,000 into and out of Singapore pursuant to
                    s 48C(1) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes
                    (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).
                    In sentencing, four other counts of the same charge were taken into
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the hearing before me on
                    3 March 2010, I was of the view that the imprisonment sentence imposed was
                    manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and substituted the
                    imprisonment term with a total fine of $24,000. I now give my
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant is a 30-year-old Indonesian
                    citizen who is the managing director and shareholder of a money-changing
                    business in Jakarta, Indonesia. On 22 May 2009, the Appellant arrived in
                    Singapore and proceeded towards the Green Channel exit. While doing so, an
                    Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) officer conducted
                    an X-ray screening of the Appellant’s trolley bag and haversack and
                    discovered some dense organic images. The officer then asked the Appellant if he
                    had anything to declare, but the Appellant said “no”. Just as the
                    officer was about to conduct a physical check of his luggage, the Appellant
                    informed the officer that he had cash with him. The Appellant was then brought
                    to the ICA duty officer and the matter was subsequently referred to the
                    Commercial Affairs Department for investigation. At the time of the
                    Appellant’s arrest, the Appellant was also found to be in possession of
                    some unfilled declaration forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Investigations later revealed that the Appellant
                    was in the business of money exchange, and he had brought cash and
                    traveller’s cheques (which is a form of bearer negotiable instruments as
                    defined under s 48B(1) of the Act) on various occasions into and out of
                    Singapore for the purposes of selling and exchanging them with a Singapore money
                    changer located at Marine Parade Central. In carrying out these transactions, it
                    was not disputed that the Appellant had been reminded by his Singapore
                    counterpart of the declaration requirement under the Act if he were to bring
                    into or out of Singapore cash of any currencies or bearer negotiable instruments
                    exceeding a value of $30,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Further investigations, and this was from the
                    Appellant’s own admission, revealed that the Appellant had moved physical
                    currencies and traveller’s cheques on seven occasions; moving cash
                    exceeding the prescribed amount <em>into</em> Singapore on
                    15, 17, 18, 22 May 2009, and moving cash exceeding the prescribed amount
                        <em>out</em> of Singapore on 15, 17, 18 May 2009.
                    These seven occasions formed the basis of the seven charges preferred against
                    him, with the total amount of cash involved being $3,236,172.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prescribed sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Pursuant to s 48C(2) of the Act, a person
                    found guilty of either moving into or out of Singapore cash exceeding the
                    prescribed amount of $30,000 in contravention of s 48(C)(1) (read with
                    s 48C(4)) shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to
                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both. Section 48B(1)
                    further defines “cash” in s 48C(1) to mean physical currency
                    or a bearer negotiable instrument (which would include, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a traveller’s cheque).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings before the District Court </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Below, the Appellant appeared in person and
                    pleaded guilty to three counts of the offence and consented to the remaining
                    four counts to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. In
                    mitigation, the Appellant apologised for committing the offences and pleaded for
                    leniency given that he was the sole breadwinner of his family and had only come
                    to Singapore with those amounts of cash for legitimate business
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In reply, the Prosecution called for a deterrent
                    sentence to be imposed on the Appellant, and in so doing, rested its submission
                    on two main grounds. Firstly, it argued that specific deterrence was necessary
                    since the Appellant knew of such a reporting requirement and deliberately chose
                    not to comply with it. Secondly, the Prosecution argued that general deterrence
                    was also necessary given that the key rationale behind implementing this cash
                    reporting regime was the enhancement of Singapore’s counter-terrorism and
                    anti-money laundering measures. On the admitted facts, the Prosecution argued
                    that the Appellant made a mockery of the reporting system by frequently moving
                    cash into and out of Singapore without making the necessary declarations on no
                    less than seven occasions. General deterrence was therefore necessary to deter
                    potential offenders from committing similar violations in the future and was
                    also appropriate given the difficulties of detection. However, this court noted
                    that while the Prosecution below had asked that a deterrent sentence be meted
                    out, it stopped short of specifically asking for the imposition of a custodial
                    term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After considering the Appellant’s
                    mitigation plea and the Prosecution’s submission on sentence, the District
                    Judge (“the DJ”) sentenced the Appellant to four months’
                    imprisonment for each of the three counts, and ordered two of these sentences to
                    run consecutively (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Luyono
                        Lam</em> [2009] SGDC 459). In all, he was sentenced to eight
                    months’ imprisonment. The DJ was in general agreement with the
                    Prosecution. He reasoned that firstly, the offences were committed with
                    premeditation. Secondly, a general deterrence sentence was necessary to deter
                    like-minded persons from committing such offences in light of the difficulties
                    facing enforcement agencies in detecting and apprehending culprits contravening
                    this cash reporting regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Dissatisfied with the sentence, the Appellant
                    appealed. The thrust of his appeal was that he was not involved in any money
                    laundering or in any other nefarious or illegal activity. His movement of the
                    various physical currencies into and out of Singapore, which formed the bases of
                    the charges, was pursuant to his money-changing business which his company was
                    legitimately involved in. He pleaded that he was truly a businessman carrying
                    out a legitimate business and it was not his intention to flout any of
                    Singapore’s laws. Viewed in this light, the Appellant submitted that the
                    DJ erred when he gave undue weight to the sentencing principle of deterrence. In
                    response, the Prosecution raised the same arguments on the need for both
                    specific and general deterrence as it did before the District Court and
                    contended that a signal ought to be sent to the public to underscore the
                    importance of the cash reporting regime. Furthermore, the Prosecution, while
                    accepting that sentences imposed in most of the previous cases were fines,
                    submitted that incarceration was appropriate in this case given the sheer volume
                    of cash involved and the increasing number of similar violations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My consideration of the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As I saw it, this appeal centred around one
                    main issue: whether in determining the appropriate sentence to be meted out to
                    the Appellant, the DJ adequately appreciated the overall objectives of the Act.
                    This was where I thought inadequate consideration was given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A major thrust of the Prosecution’s
                    submission in both the District Court and this court was that, on the factual
                    matrix of this case, a general and specific deterrence sentence was called for.
                    I accepted that the Appellant’s deliberate refusal in making the
                    declaration was based on his perception that such an infraction was technical at
                    best given that he was carrying out a legitimate business in moving physical
                    currencies and traveller’s cheques into and out of Singapore. For that
                    infringement, I acknowledged that he should indeed be punished. What was in
                    dispute, however, was whether there was a need to impose a custodial sentence as
                    deterrence in a case such as this. In this regard, it is crucial to consider the
                    objectives of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is patently clear that Parliament’s
                    primary objective in enacting the Act was to criminalise the laundering of
                    benefits derived from corruption, drug trafficking and other serious crimes and
                    to allow investigation and confiscation of such benefits, as well as, in
                    general, to curb and protect society from such serious criminal activities (if
                    anything, the title of the Act would have already suggested this; see also
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (6 July 1999) vol 70 at col 1731
                    (Wong Kan Seng, Minister for Home Affairs)). Specifically, in relation to Part
                    VIA of the Act which comprises ss 48A to 48G, s 48A provides in no
                    uncertain terms the objective of this part of the Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Object of this Part</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48A.  The object of this Part is to impose measures for
                            the disclosure of information regarding movements of physical currency
                            and bearer negotiable instruments into and out of Singapore <em>for the purpose of detecting, investigating and prosecuting
                                drug trafficking offences and serious
                        offences</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Part VIA of the Act was introduced via the enactment of the
                    Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits)
                    (Amendment) Act (Act 44 of 2007) (“the Amendment Act”). At the
                    second reading of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes
                    (Confiscation of Benefits) (Amendment) Bill (Bill 33 of 2007), which was
                    eventually enacted as the Amendment Act, the Senior Minister of State for Home
                    Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, reiterated that the purpose of the cash
                    reporting regime under Part VIA was to enhance the anti-money laundering and
                    counter-terrorism financing measures (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em>
                    (19 September 2007) vol 83 at col 1965):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is an urgent need for us to address the increasingly complex
                        challenges posed by the <em>abuse of our financial systems by
                            terrorists and money launders</em>. The devastating 9/11 attacks
                        underscore the urgent need for governments around the world to implement
                        measures to suppress terrorist financing as part of the global effort to
                        combat terrorism [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the very object of such a regime was to serve as a tool
                    to detect and prevent such insidious criminal syndicates or terrorists from
                    using our financial system for their own illicit purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     While the DJ did, in fact, acknowledge the
                    overarching objective and context of such a cash reporting regime, the DJ
                    appeared not to have given sufficient consideration to it when sentencing the
                    Appellant, a person who was in legitimate business and not involved in any
                    money-laundering or terrorist activities and was a person without antecedents.
                    The punishment imposed must correspond to the culpability of an offender
                        <em>in the context of the objectives of the Act</em>
                    (and in this case, it must correspond in particular to the objective of Part VIA
                    of the Act). I also noted that Parliament had enacted an over-inclusive
                    provision in s 48C(1) of the Act which made it an offence for a person to
                    bring into or out of Singapore cash amounts of more than $30,000 if an
                    appropriate declaration was not made, regardless of whether the money originated
                    from money laundering or is intended for terrorist activities, or otherwise. It
                    is understandable that Parliament had seen it fit to enact such an all-embracing
                    provision in order to ensure that the Act’s objectives would be
                    effectively met. That said, a court still has the responsibility to strike a
                    balance between upholding the cash reporting regime and the spirit behind that
                    provision, and mete out a sentence that fairly accounts for the
                    over-inclusiveness of the provision and yet without disregarding the real
                    objective of the provision in assessing culpability for the purpose of
                    punishment. Arguably, Parliament, in not imposing a mandatory minimum period of
                    imprisonment for such an offence, recognised that there is a range of
                    culpability for the offence under s 48C and it would be up to the courts to
                    determine <em>when</em> it would be appropriate to
                    incarcerate an offender for such a violation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In several past cases involving materially the
                    same fact situation, where the offenders were found to have fallen foul of the
                    reporting requirement, but where the movement of cash was predicated on the
                    offenders’ legitimate money-changing business, the courts had
                    appropriately exercised their discretion to impose only a fine (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Loh Chai Huat</em> (DAC 22565 of 2008),
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Lai Nai Jen</em> (DAC
                    30616–31620 of 2008), <em>Public Prosecutor v Ahmad
                        Ibrahim</em> (DAC 31396–31398 of 2009) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Yee Wai Pang</em> (DAC 44703 of 2009), where
                    fines were imposed notwithstanding that the offenders in these cases knew of the
                    reporting requirement and had deliberately failed to make the necessary
                    declaration). Similarly, fines were only imposed in cases where cash was
                    transported for the purposes connected with legitimate commercial transactions
                    (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Tay Zar Myo Hein</em> (DAC
                    5504 of 2009) (cash found in offender’s possession was for purchasing
                    stock for a friend’s handphone business), <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Nguyen Ni Xa</em> (DAC 35521 of 2009) (cash found in
                    offender’s possession was for handphone trading business) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Worrawut Rungchiwa</em> (DAC
                    30242–30244 of 2009) (cash found in offender’s possession was
                    intended payment to his rattan and rattan furniture supplier in
                    Malaysia)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In contrast, courts have been prepared to
                    impose terms of incarceration where there was an underlying crime to the
                    movement of money. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Stanley Ong Beng
                        Hock</em> (DAC 20870, 33414 and 33415 of 2009), the offender was
                    sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for his s 48C(1) offence when
                    he attempted to transport out of Singapore part of the physical cash which he
                    stole from his employer. Similarly, in <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Derek Graham Engelbreact @ Sergio Roberto Kabemba</em> (DAC 21233 of
                    2009), the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for trying
                    to leave Singapore with fraudulently obtained funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having considered these precedents, it was
                    clear to me that ordinarily, unless the money sought to be moved (and not
                    declared as required) were tainted as shown in those cases cited in the
                    preceding paragraph, imposition of a custodial sentence for an offender under
                    s 48C was not usually called for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In this regard, I would emphasise that it is
                    not illegal to move any sum of money into or out of Singapore. Very often the
                    offender might opt not to declare out of convenience so that there would not be
                    any delay, in arriving or departing from Singapore, on account of having to
                    comply with that requirement. In the case of the Appellant, his trips to
                    Singapore were invariably day trips and so there was a need to save time. While
                    I am not saying that this is excusable, I am simply stating that this could be
                    at the forefront of the Appellant’s mind when he deliberately omitted to
                    disclose the currencies he was carrying. Since offenders such as the Appellant
                    are engaged in that nature of activity (money-changing) for profit, it would
                    serve just as good a deterrence, both general and specific, if a substantial
                    fine is imposed. Such a penalty, in my view, would be an adequate and effective
                    disincentive against deliberate disclosure violations. Moreover, as stated
                    earlier, the real culprits which the law targets are those involved in
                    money-laundering and terrorist activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Quite naturally the burden fell on the
                    Appellant to prove that the currencies he moved into and out of Singapore were
                    pursuant to legitimate commercial transactions. In this case, it was glaringly
                    clear that the offences were committed against the backdrop of a legitimate
                    business. It was not disputed that the Appellant was then the managing director
                    and shareholder of an Indonesian money-changing business. There was neither a
                    suggestion nor suspicion that the Appellant’s company was a business front
                    for any illegal criminal activity or was used as a money laundering arm of a
                    criminal syndicate. Notably, when the Appellant was arrested, he was found with
                    numerous physical currencies which were in irregular denominations. This, in my
                    view, corroborated with his claimed business. The significance of this detail
                    did not seem to have been appreciated by the parties. Therefore, considering the
                    totality of the evidence before me, I was amply satisfied that the Appellant was
                    engaged in a <em>bona fide</em> money-changing business and
                    was simply in Singapore to legitimately trade currencies with his Singapore
                    counterpart. Thus the large amounts involved. But as counsel for the Appellant
                    had pointed out, what amount of money (in varying currencies) the Appellant had
                    brought into Singapore, he would in turn have brought out a substantial part, if
                    not all, of an equivalent amount (in other currencies). In a sense, there would
                    be double counting if we were to just add the two sums brought into Singapore
                    and correspondingly brought out of Singapore by the Appellant, which counsel
                    reckoned to be $1,866,457 and $1,369,715 respectively. As I stated earlier, the
                    DJ, in considering the need for deterrence, did not have sufficient regard to
                    what was the real mischief which the Act sought to address.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I recognise that it is trite law that an
                    appellate court should not interfere with a sentence meted out by the trial
                    judge unless it is satisfied that (see <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at [14]):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the trial judge had made the wrong decision as to
                            the proper factual matrix for sentence;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the trial judge had erred in appreciating the
                            material before him.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the sentence was wrong in principle;
                        or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, or
                            manifestly inadequate.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the circumstances, and bearing in mind the
                    precedents, any term of imprisonment would have been disproportionate to the
                    nature of the offence committed and the culpability of the Appellant. Equally
                    important, I noted that the charges preferred by the Prosecution were primarily
                    based on the money-changing receipts that the Appellant himself produced to
                    support his claim that he was legitimately trading in those currencies. If he
                    had really thought that by not making the declaration he had committed a grave
                    offence, I would have imagined that he would not have so willingly confessed to
                    the similar earlier trips which he had made. Quite clearly, the Appellant came
                    clean from the very outset, and this reflected the extent of remorse within him.
                    Without such cooperation, details of his past movements of cash would not have
                    surfaced and would not have led to the multiplicity of charges he now faced.
                    These were undoubtedly mitigating factors to which consideration should be given
                    (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Hoon Choo</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 803 at [16] and <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at
                    [69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For all the above reasons, I was of the firm
                    view that the circumstances of the case only warranted a sentence of no more
                    than a fine. That said, I agreed with the submission made by the Prosecution
                    below that a substantial fine ought to be imposed to reflect the predominant
                    principle of specific deterrence on the facts of this case as well as the need
                    for some general deterrence against similar offenders avoiding the reporting
                    requirement in the future. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and I ordered the
                    sentences to be substituted with a fine of $8,000 per charge, making a total
                    fine of $24,000. Such a fine should cause sufficient pain to act as a general
                    and specific deterrent to a money-changer like the Appellant.</p>
