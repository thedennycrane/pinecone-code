        Kathryn Thong AR:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       It was once warned that ‘Metaphors in law
                    are to be narrowly watched, for starting as devices to liberate thought, they
                    end often by enslaving it.’<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> There
                    is much wisdom in this cautious approach. Though metaphors in legal discourse
                    aid the understanding of abstract legal concepts and in this regard, are
                    enabling, paradoxically they are often limiting as well. This is because the
                    imagination is susceptible to falling back on past images and impressions evoked
                    by metaphors- but the metaphorical reality may not be altogether on fours with a
                    particular factual scenario. The impact created by metaphors (especially
                    visually) can cause the mind’s eye to become fixated on the metaphorical
                    image instead of the particular factual scenario, thereby ignoring the
                    differences between the factual scenario and the metaphorical reality. When the
                    analysis begins with the metaphor instead of the facts, the analysis is
                    incomplete and may even be inaccurate. Other times, a metaphor may have a
                    neutral quality in the English language but is imbued with a negative essence in
                    legal parlance. When such a metaphor becomes a legal cliché, when it becomes so
                    firmly entrenched in legal argot, there is a danger of unreflectively relying on
                    it as a substitute for rugged legal analysis. One such metaphor is the
                    “frequently exploited” ‘fishing’metaphor (<em>Dante Yap Go v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG</em>
                    [2007] SGHC 69 (“<em>Dante</em>”)
                    at [49]) in discovery applications which is often used by counsel to stigmatize
                    their opponent’s case. This metaphor is fraught with problems as Justice
                    Brown in <em>Goddard v Shoal Harbour Marine Services Ltd. et
                        al</em> 24 Western Weekly Reports 166 (1958, BCSC) pointedly remarked
                    at p 168 of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would be easier to deal judicially with contested discovery if one knew
                        to which of the many kinds of sport or commercial fishing the learned judge
                        first use that murky expression had reference ... in at least one sense all
                        proper discovery is fishing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the summons before me the Plaintiff sought a
                    Further and Better List of Documents (“Further List”) after
                    general discovery between parties had been carried out. The Defendant opposed
                    the Summons on the basis that the classes of documents sought were irrelevant to
                    the pleaded issues and that the Plaintiff was essentially embarking on a
                    “fishing expedition”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The various classes of documents sought did
                    appear potentially extensive to me. However, simply because the categories of
                    documents sought were wide-ranging did not automatically mean that the Plaintiff
                    was embarking on a “fishing expedition” as lawyers would interpret
                    the phrase to mean. The pejorative use of the term “fishing” is
                    perhaps unjustified- indeed, there is nothing objectionable about fishing or a
                    fishing expedition- but that is another subject altogether. In legal discourse,
                    I consider the “fishing” metaphor a by-word for the opportunistic
                    use of the discovery process by a party to randomly search for information,
                    usually in the hope that documents which may be beneficial or advantageous in
                    some way to it will surface. Choo Han Teck J when he was a judicial
                    commissioner remarked at [6] of <em>Thyssen Hunnebeck Singapore
                        Pte Ltd v TTJ Civil Engineering Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2003] 1 SLR(R) 75 that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, I would hold that a "fishing expedition" in the context of
                        discovery refers to <em>the aimless trawling of an unlimited
                            sea</em>. Where, on the other hand, the party concerned knows a
                        specific and identifiable spot into which he wishes to drop a line (or two),
                        I would not regard that as a "fishing expedition". But I would myself
                            <em>prefer to approach such applications strictly on the
                            basis of the broader relevancy test</em>. <em>That
                            has the advantage of training one's focus directly on the matter at
                            hand, and avoiding the distractions inherent in analogies - even one
                            that has become a term of art, the "fishing expedition</em>", for
                        example.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, the fishing metaphor used in many a discovery application must
                    be approached with caution if even considered at all. Discovery must always be
                    referable to the criteria of relevance and necessity and to this end, the court
                    will have to delve into the facts of the parties’ cases. As the United
                    States Supreme Court in <em>Hickman v Taylor</em>.
                    329 U.S. 495,507 (1947) remarked</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No longer can the time-honored cry of ‘fishing’ expedition
                        serve to preclude a party from inquiring facts underlying the
                        opponent’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute in Suit 504/2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The summons for an order that a Further List be
                    furnished (“the Summons”) arose from Suit 504/2009 (“the
                    Suit”). Briefly, the Defendant in the Suit is being sued for breaching
                    certain duties towards its erstwhile client, the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiff is a bank incorporated in
                    Switzerland, carrying on banking business there and elsewhere. The Defendant is
                    a limited liability law partnership, carrying on practice as advocates and
                    solicitors in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiff had retained the Defendant to act
                    for it in a dispute it had with the Far Eastern Shipping Co Plc (FESCO).
                    According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had advised it that it had a good
                    cause of action against FESCO and had sufficient grounds in law and fact to
                    arrest a vessel “VASILY GOLOVNIN” (“the Vessel”)
                    should it enter Singapore waters. I shall refer to the arrest of the Vessel as
                    “the admiralty action”. Additionally, the Defendant advised that
                    the fact that the Plaintiff had commenced separate proceedings in Lome, Togo and
                    arrested another vessel (“the sister vessel”) which arrest was
                    subsequently set aside, did not preclude the Plaintiff from arresting the Vessel
                    in fresh proceedings commenced in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Eventually, the Vessel was
                    arrested on 18 March 2006. Acting alongside the Plaintiff bank with
                    congruent interests in the Vessel and sister vessel was another bank, Credit
                    Agricole (Suisse) SA (“CAG”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       FESCO however succeeded in setting aside the
                    warrant of arrest on 10 July 2006 when the assistant registrar, Ms Ang
                    Ching Pin ("AR Ang") set the arrest aside and struck out the banks' writ of
                    summons on the grounds that there was <em>inter alia</em>,
                    material non-disclosure in the affidavits leading to the warrant of arrest and
                    in submissions made to the court at the <em>ex parte</em>
                        hearing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The learned AR Ang however did not award
                    FESCO damages for the arrest of the <em>Vessel</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiff then filed an appeal to a Judge in
                    chambers <em>vide</em> RA 214/2006 against AR Ang’s
                    decision in setting aside the arrest and striking out the writ of summons.
                    Meanwhile, FESCO filed a cross-appeal against her refusal to award it damages
                        <em>vide</em> RA 216/2006. It is the Plaintiff’s
                    case that it subsequently categorically instructed the Defendant to withdraw RA
                    214/2006 but these instructions were disregarded. Instead, the Plaintiff
                    alleges, the Defendant proceeded with the appeal pursuant to CAG’s
                    instructions. This is strongly disputed by the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Both RA 214/2006 and RA 216/2006 were eventually
                    dismissed by Tan Lee Meng J on 31 July 2007. The Plaintiff avers that
                    it did not wish to appeal against Tan J’s decision in RA 214/2006.
                    CAG however chose to do so and appealed to the Court of Appeal in CA 109/2007.
                    It was represented by the Defendant. FESCO also appealed against the decision in
                    RA 216/2006 <em>vide</em> CA 110/2009 wherein CAG and the
                    Plaintiff were the respondents. Both appeals were heard together. In its
                    judgment, the Court of Appeal noted that the Plaintiff was not pursuing the
                    appeal against the decision in RA 214/2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> On 19 September 2008,
                    the Court of Appeal dismissed CAG’s appeal and allowed FESCO’s claim
                    for damages arising from the wrongful arrest of the Vessel. FESCO was entitled
                    to costs of both appeals as well as all the costs below in full.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff is now suing the Defendant for
                    breach of contract and/or negligence. It contends that as a consequence of its
                    negligence, the Defendant has: (i) caused the Plaintiff to be liable to FESCO
                    for amongst other things, damages for wrongful arrest of the Vessel; (ii) caused
                    the Plaintiff to suffer “reputational loss” as a result of the
                    Court of Appeal decision in CA 109/2007 and CA110/2007 and (iii) that the
                    Plaintiff’s confidence in pursuing the primary arbitration of its dispute
                    with FESCO in London has been “shattered” and the Plaintiff has
                    thereby lost an opportunity to pursue the arbitration with “full vigour
                    and to a successful conclusion”. It has thus allegedly suffered a loss in
                    being unable to recover its basic claim in the primary dispute.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Two reputable English firms, Waterson Hicks
                    (“WH”) and Clyde &amp; Co (“C&amp;C”) are also in
                    the picture. According to the Defence filed by the Defendant on 9 July
                    2009, C&amp;C had instructed the Defendant as Singapore counsel on behalf of
                    C&amp;C’s client, CAG, in relation to the possible arrest of the Vessel.
                    The Defendant also averred that C&amp;C had informed it that WH and C&amp;C had
                    for sometime been advising the Plaintiff and CAG respectively in relation to
                    their dispute with FESCO.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> These alleged facts are not admitted by the
                        Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Genesis of the Summons</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     While it may appear indulgent to relate how
                    the Summons came about, it is necessary to explain the eventual costs orders I
                    made. A further and better list of documents is usually sought when based on the
                    list of documents already served, it appears on the face of it that in all
                    probability the opponent has or has had other relevant documents beyond those
                    disclosed (see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 24/5/1) (“<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>”). Whether such a
                    further list ought to be furnished though, is subject to certain requirements
                    (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 16 December 2009, the Plaintiff took
                    out the Summons. Initially, the Defendant in its letters to the court and the
                    Plaintiff objected to the Summons on grounds that it was premature and a breach
                    of the court’s orders. Other grounds of objection would subsequently be
                    raised at the hearing itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It turned out that about 4 months before the
                    Summons was taken out, pursuant to Assistant Registrar David Lee’s
                    (“AR Lee”) orders given at a Pre-Trial Conference
                    (“PTC”) on 21 August 2009, the Defendant had filed its list
                    of documents with an affidavit verifying the list (“the Original
                    list”). Though the Plaintiff failed to do the same by 20 November
                    2009 (which was the deadline set by AR Lee for both parties), it eventually
                    obtained leave to file its list of documents by 3 December 2009. At another
                    PTC on 4 December 2009, AR Lee ordered that parties were to carry out
                    inspection by 11 December 2009, 4.00pm. This was duly done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Crucially, the learned AR Lee had also ordered
                    at the PTC of 4 December 2009 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i) parties were to request for specific discovery from the other side no
                        later than 24 December 2009, 4.00pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii) parties to reply to each other’s request for specific discovery
                        no later than 15 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If either or both parties are not satisfied with the response, parties to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Leave to write in for earlier [PTC] in the event that parties are able to
                        resolve the issue of further discovery amicably between them (<em>i.e</em>. without the need for an
                            application).”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Post-inspection, the Plaintiff was
                    dissatisfied with thirteen of the inspected documents. It wrote to the Defendant
                    on 14 December 2009 indicating the nature of the deficiencies and the
                    remedial action to take. Thereafter correspondence flowed between parties from
                    14 to 23 December with the Defendant endeavouring to address the
                    Plaintiff’s concerns. I found that the Plaintiff’s tone in its
                    letters was cordial and the Defendant’s in its replies,
                    co-operative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Correspondence between the parties regarding the Summons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Unbeknownst to the Defendant, whilst parties
                    were corresponding on the issue of inspection (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), the Plaintiff had filed the Summons and a
                    supporting affidavit (“the supporting affidavit”) on
                    16 December 2009. Prayer 1 stated that the Defendant was to provide a
                    further and better list of documents verified by affidavit within 3 days of the
                    order to be made; prayer 2 asked for costs of the application to be paid by the
                    Defendant. The supporting affidavit which ran up to 8 pages set out several
                    classes of documents which the Plaintiff averred the Defendant had failed to
                    disclose in the Original list. It bears mention that the Summons and the
                    supporting affidavit were only served on the Defendant five days after the
                    Summons was taken out<em>, i.e</em> on 21 December
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In response, the Defendant wrote to the
                    Plaintiff on 22 December 2009 that it was “surprised” at the
                    Summons. It highlighted the pertinent orders made by AR Lee (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above) and asserted that the Summons was
                    “premature and in breach of the directions of the
                        Court.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It urged the
                    Plaintiff to “please withdraw the application immediately”.
                    Additionally it stated that it was reserving its right to ask for indemnity
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Nothing was heard from the Plaintiff and the
                    following day, the Defendant wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court
                    (“the Registrar”) arguing in its letter that the Plaintiff’s
                    Summons was misconceived in light of the directions given by AR Lee. It argued
                    that the Plaintiff should have written to it by 24 December 2009, 4.00pm,
                    requesting specific discovery as <em>per</em> AR
                    Lee’s order and then wait for it to respond by 15 January 2010. Only
                    if the Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the response would it be at liberty to
                    make a specific discovery application by 22 January 2010, 4.00pm. The
                    letter also highlighted that prior to the Summons being taken out, there had
                    been no preceding letter of request and no opportunity for the Defendant to
                    respond to the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As the hearing of the Summons was slated to
                    take place on 30 December 2009, the Defendant also requested in the said
                    letter that the hearing be postponed to a date after 15 January 2010. This,
                    it submitted, would give it time to take instructions should it wish to file a
                    reply affidavit and respond to the application (notwithstanding that it had
                    previously written to the Plaintiff that it did not propose to
                    “dignify” the Plaintiff’s Summons by filing a reply
                    affidavit <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In response, the Plaintiff wrote to the
                    Registrar on 23 December 2009 that AR Lee’s directions pertained to
                    specific discovery whereas the Summons for a Further List was concerned with
                    general discovery. Hence, it argued, AR Lee’s directions had nothing to do
                    with documents which were not disclosed in the filed Original list.
                    Consequently, the Plaintiff’s Summons did not breach any
                timelines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Plaintiff also harked back to an unless
                    order application <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> brought by the Defendant when the
                    former failed to file its list of documents by 20 November 2009 (see
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). Pointing out that it had
                    only one day to respond to the unless order summons then, the Plaintiff retorted
                    that the Defendant presently had more than a week to respond to the Summons. It
                    also pointed out that then, the Defendant had strenuously argued against the
                    Plaintiff’s application for an extension of time to file its list of
                    documents. The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant could not now complain
                    “simply because the shoe is now on the other foot”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Despite dredging up the “dirt”
                    on the Defendant, the Plaintiff continued in its letter that “in spite of
                    all this, we are prepared to agree to adjourn this application to
                    8.1.2010…”. I found that these unhappy events raised by the
                    Plaintiff were wholly irrelevant to the Summons. More than that, they did not
                    explain, much less justify the Plaintiff’s act of filing the Summons
                    without a preceding letter of request. I also noted that while the
                    Plaintiff’s letter suggested that the Defendant had acted unreasonably by
                    taking out the unless order summons, a perusal of the litigation history reveals
                    that the Plaintiff had actually been remiss in not informing the Defendant of
                    its inability to meet the 20 November 2009 deadline and not timeously
                    seeking an extension of time. It is also telling that although the application
                    for the unless order was denied and an extension of time granted to it, the
                    Plaintiff was ordered to pay costs to the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On the eve of the scheduled hearing, <em>i.e</em>. 29 December 2009, the Defendant wrote to the
                    Registrar yet again, averring that the Plaintiff’s request for the
                    documents allegedly not disclosed should have been brought by way of specific
                    discovery. It also pointed out that AR Lee’s directions were geared
                    towards ensuring that parties resolved the issue of specific discovery by
                    correspondence to save time and costs. Rebutting the Plaintiff’s assertion
                    that the Summons was for general discovery under Order 24 rule 1
                    (“O 24 r 1”) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006
                    Rev Ed) (“ROC”), the Defendant rightly pointed out that the
                    Summons itself “plainly state[d] that it [was] made under Order 24
                    Rules 5 and/or 12 of the Rules of Court” and that the Plaintiff was
                    seeking specific categories of documents. Once again it iterated that the
                    Plaintiff was obliged to have made a request for specific discovery by letter
                    and to await its response before making an application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There was no doubt in my mind before the
                    hearing itself that the Summons was defective at best, confusing at worst. It is
                    indeed a greater ill for a summons to be confusing than defective because in the
                    former, the court and the opponent are unclear as to what the party taking out
                    the Summons is really seeking. As a result, the opponent is placed in an
                    invidious position, being unable to appreciate the case it has to
                meet.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Hearing on 30 December 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I denied the Defendant’s request for an
                    adjournment and the hearing proceeded on 30 December 2009. Counsel for the
                    Plaintiff, Mr Liew, conceded that the Summons should have cited O 24
                    r 1 and not Order 24 rule 5 (“O 24 r 5”)
                    of the ROC. This notwithstanding, he strenuously argued that the Summons was
                    clearly pursuant to general discovery and that the Plaintiff was entitled to a
                    Further List. Ms Cheryl Tan, counsel for the Defendant, indicated that she
                    was seeking an adjournment of the hearing and argued that the application was
                    one for specific discovery with the result that AR Lee’s orders had been
                    ignored. Both parties essentially rehashed the arguments raised in their letters
                    to each other and the Court (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>-<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     When I queried Mr Liew why the Summons
                    was taken out without a request, he explained that there was no time to do so as
                    the situation was urgent, there being an impending deadline of 15 January
                    2010 by which time parties had to have made requests for specific discovery. The
                    irony of this submission would not have been lost on anyone- how could there
                    have been time to take out the Summons and depose an affidavit but none to write
                    a letter to the Defendant, especially when correspondence was already ongoing
                    between the parties (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above)?
                    Further, the Summons was only served on the Defendant five days after it was
                    filed. One would have thought that given the alleged urgency of the situation,
                    the Plaintiff would have timeously served the Defendant with the Summons and
                    supporting affidavit. 16 December 2009 was a Wednesday and the Plaintiff
                    had a<em>t least</em> 2 full working days before the
                    weekend to serve the papers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I pressed Mr Liew further for the
                    reasons(s) behind taking out the Summons. He averred that the documents missing
                    from the Original list were documents common to both parties. If such documents
                    could be omitted, he submitted, it was uncertain whether documents not common to
                    parties had been disclosed. In the circumstances, the Plaintiff had to seek
                    recourse from the court to have the documents produced. By this, the Plaintiff
                    was in my view effectively submitting that the Defendant would have denied the
                    Plaintiff’s request for a Further List had it been made. To confirm my
                    understanding, I asked Mr Liew if he was suggesting that the Defendant had
                    displayed a pattern of conduct that convinced him that the latter would have
                    been difficult if the Plaintiff had requested a Further List by way of letter,
                    thereby impelling the Plaintiff to take out the Summons. Mr Liew confirmed
                    this was so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I rejected Mr Liew’s submission
                    that the application was so urgent that it warranted taking out the Summons
                    without the courtesy of a letter to the Defendant. To begin with, the urgency
                    was in a sense self-perceived and self-inflicted- the timelines set by AR David
                    Lee were certainly not immutable. In fact, the Plaintiff itself must have known
                    this when it referred to AR Lee’s directions as “<em>guidelines</em> aimed at facilitating a quick and speedy discovery
                    process” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In the spirit of an
                    expeditious resolution of the discovery process, it must have been understood by
                    the Plaintiff (and the Defendant for that matter) that the timelines were not
                    meant to be inflexible. The court would certainly not begrudge parties a
                    re-fixing of timelines if it was justifiable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Next, the Plaintiff’s conduct subsequent
                    to the taking out of the Summons was at odds with its position that the
                    application was urgent for it had served the Defendant with the Summons and
                    supporting affidavit only 5 days after filing them. The Plaintiff had also in
                    fact somewhat undermined its stance when it represented that it was prepared to
                    have the hearing adjourned to 8 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I must add too that I was not convinced by
                    Mr Liew’s contention that the Defendant had been difficult and would
                    be unyielding if the Plaintiff had made a request. This was speculative and
                    further, there was little basis on the evidence before me to infer any obdurate
                    conduct on the Defendant’s part. Besides, parties had been corresponding
                    when the Summons was taken out. It would not have taken much for the Plaintiff
                    to inquire about the missing documents. In the circumstances, I was of the view
                    that the Plaintiff had been perfunctory in taking out the Summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr Liew pointed out that there were no
                    express rule providing that an application for a further and better list
                    should be preceded by a letter of request to the opposing party (unlike an
                    application for further and better particulars). I agree. But even so, this
                    lacuna (for lack of a better word) should not and does not give rise to a
                    license for the Plaintiff to take out a Summons against the Defendant in this
                    manner. Where rules fail to prescribe, the dictates of common courtesy and
                    common sense <em>continue</em> to operate in their full
                    vigour to oil the cogs of the adversarial process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, I could see no
                    justification for the Plaintiff to take out the Summons without a preceding
                    letter of request. In fact, it is plain from that part of AR Lee’s orders
                    where he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Leave to write in for earlier [PTC] in the event that parties are able to
                        resolve the issue of further discovery amicably between them (<em>i.e</em>. without the need for an
                            application).”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">that it was expected that parties would at least <em>attempt</em> to resolve matters of further discovery amicably. While
                    this direction read in its context might be read as pertaining only to specific
                    discovery, its spirit must have also been intended to apply to general
                    discovery. It would indeed be a logically incoherent and inconsistent position
                    to adopt if the direction was construed as strictly pertaining to specific
                    discovery and not to general discovery. Besides, construing the phrase
                    ‘further discovery’ broadly, it would encompass a further and better
                    list under general discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     AR Lee’s directions aside, it appears
                    that the accepted and even expected practice when documents are believed to have
                    been omitted from a list of documents is for an informal inquiry to be made
                    before invoking the formal processes of the Court. At paragraph 24/1/5 of
                        <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>, the learned
                    editors point out that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The responsibility of solicitors extends further than this to an
                        independent duty to give proper discovery. This duty includes having a
                        sufficient understanding of the case to know which documents to look for and
                        to appreciate which documents are relevant. There is also a positive duty to
                        review thoroughly an opponent’s list, to <b><em>consider
                            whether there might be other relevant documents that have not been
                            disclosed, and to make an inquiry about any such documents</em></b>.
                        The failure to fulfil these responsibilities might be such a dereliction of
                        duty as to justify a costs order under O 59 r 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The thrust of the above passage is that solicitors are under a duty to
                    not only give proper discovery, they also have to ensure that the opponent has
                    done likewise by disclosing all relevant documents. Of import to me here is the
                    italicised portion that an “inquiry” is to be made of documents
                    missing from an opponent’s list. It is painfully obvious that the party or
                    person to whom the inquiry must be directed is the opponent or opponent’s
                    counsel. It certainly is not the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In O’Hare &amp; Browne’s <em>Civil Litigation</em> (14<sup>th</sup> ed.,
                    2009, Sweet &amp; Maxwell) the learned authors at paragraph 30.022 remarked the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When you receive your opponent’s list you should check not only to
                        see what documents you will wish to inspect but also to ensure that it is
                        complete…But what can you do if you suspect that your opponent will
                        not, or has not, made proper disclosure in accordance with the court order
                        or is objecting to produce for inspection documents you have a right to
                        inspect? <em>The first step will usually be to raise this
                            matter in correspondence</em>. Otherwise, if you still believe
                        that the disclosure of documents…is inadequate, you can make an
                        application to the court for specific disclosure. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(In the United Kingdom (“UK”), the term
                    ‘disclosure’ is used instead of
                ‘discovery’)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     To belabour the point, this sentiment is also
                    echoed in another text authored by Craig Osborne in <em>Civil
                        Litigation</em> (Blackstone Press Limited, 2000,
                        8<sup>th</sup> ed). At p 259 of his book, Osborne avers
                    that when disclosure has been undertaken and ‘there is a document or class
                    of document whose existence had been anticipated and which is believed to be
                    relevant to the issues, but the opponent does not include it in his list’
                    that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first step with this, as with all such queries, is simply to raise the
                        matter in letter form and see what the response is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…if an unsatisfactory response or no response is received a party
                        should apply for specific disclosure of the documents in
                        question…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As is the situation locally, there is no
                    rule in the UK that requires preceding letter of requests to be written to
                    an opponent for full disclosure should a party be dissatisfied with the
                    disclosed list of documents. Yet such a practice is endorsed, encouraged and
                    even expected. As such, I find that the Plaintiff’s suggestion that the
                    Defendant was nitpicking on “procedural minutiae”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> in
                    protesting that a letter of request was not given to it was woefully misplaced.
                    While I would not go so far as to suggest that every application for a further
                    and better list of documents <em>must</em> be preceded by a
                    letter of request, such a practice is indeed salutary in facilitating the
                    expeditious resolution of one’s discovery obligations and I would add, in
                    preserving the cordial relations (or whatever is left of it) between parties.
                    Each case however turns upon its own unique facts; where as in the present case
                    the Plaintiff had no compelling reason(s) or convincing basis to take out the
                    Summons in the manner and circumstances that it did, little if any, indulgence
                    should be given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Earlier, I described the Plaintiff’s
                    application as ‘perfunctory’. This was borne out in other aspects of
                    the application. Perusing the supporting affidavit, I noted that the classes of
                    documents the Plaintiff submitted it was seeking were those, which amongst other
                    things, “may lead the Plaintiffs’ [<em>sic</em>] on a train of inquiry resulting in information which may
                    adversely affect the Defendant’s case”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Now it is well-established that
                    documents which may lead parties to a “train of inquiry” can only
                    be discovered pursuant to specific discovery under O 24 r 5. The
                    provision speaks for itself and case law has established this (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> and <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    below). General discovery on the other hand, which is governed by O 24
                    r 1 provides only for discovery of documents which (i) the party relies or
                    will rely on; (ii) documents which could adversely affect his own case;
                    adversely affect another party’s case or support another party’s
                    case. It is a narrower scope of inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I observed too that a supporting affidavit is
                    not usually filed in such an application for a further and better list of
                    documents (whereas one is required for specific discovery). I accepted
                    Mr Liew’s point that this did not mean that the Plaintiff was
                    precluded from filing a supporting affidavit. Yet, examining the application
                    holistically, I felt that the application was confusing. It did not matter to me
                    that Plaintiff’s counsel was not confused- Mr Liew was adamant that
                    the Summons was for general discovery. What was pertinent was that the Summons
                    and affidavit when read together presented a confused picture to the court. As
                    adverted to earlier, this is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs (see
                        <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>) above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the premises, I did not think it out of
                    order to grant the Defendant an adjournment of the hearing. The Defendant was
                    entitled to know the case it had to meet and having undoubtedly been taken by
                    surprise as well, I believed it had to be given adequate time to respond to the
                    application. There would be no prejudice caused to either party by virtue of the
                    adjournment. I decided that the hearing could be adjourned to 15 January
                    2010. However I did not make any finding as to whether the application was one
                    for general or specific discovery. Ms Tan then suggested that the Plaintiff
                    amend its Summons and the affidavit. She further ventured that the Defendant be
                    given up to 15 January 2010 to file a reply affidavit, notwithstanding its
                    earlier remarks (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). I ordered
                    that a reply affidavit be filed by 15 January 2010 and the hearing for the
                    Summons was adjourned to 18 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Hearing on 18 January 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     At this hearing, the Plaintiff sought leave to
                    amend its Summons. However, it did not remove the offending “train of
                    inquiry” phrase in its supporting affidavit. Ms Tan objected to the
                    amendment, arguing that the Summons clearly stood as an application for specific
                    discovery. She submitted however, that should the court allow the amendment, the
                    Plaintiff could not rely on the “train of inquiry” limb. This was
                    moot. Indeed, general discovery does not afford the wider scope of discovery
                    available under O 24 r 5 which allows documents that may lead to a
                    train of inquiry to be discovered. This has been the law since 2000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>, when the terminology ‘relating to
                    matters in question in the action’ in the former O 24 r 1(1) and
                    such similar language in the other rules of Order 24 was removed. The
                    advent of the new rules meant that the scope of discovery under O 24
                    r 1 was narrowed to the categories enumerated under it. Specific discovery
                    under O 24 r 5, however, permits the discovery of documents which
                    would lead to a train of inquiry, thereby affording a wider scope of discovery
                    in the event that general discovery was inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 465 at [17] and [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Documents which were required to be discovered under the concept of
                        ‘train of inquiry’ are no longer discoverable under the present
                        O 24 r 1. However, this is not to say that the concept of
                        ‘train of inquiry’ has been removed from the Rules. It has
                        reappeared in r 5 which relates to the discovery of specific
                        documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I allowed the amendment and the hearing proceeded on the basis that
                    the Summons was an application for general discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The classes of documents sought and/or alleged
                    to be missing by the Plaintiff were the following<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_i"></a>(i)     at least 9 separate emails exchanged
                        between lawyers of the Defendant law firm, C&amp;C and WH and a
                        “pivotal” email sent by the Defendant to WH reporting on the
                        Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 109/2007 and CA
                    110/2007;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     correspondence between the Defendant and C&amp;C (Singapore and the UK) and

                        of the Defendant law firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Liew iterated at the
                    hearing that the classes of documents enumerated above were merely examples of
                    the Defendant’s failure to disclose relevant documents and should not be
                    taken as being exhaustive of all relevant documents that were undisclosed by the
                    Defendant. His refrain was that if documents (such as the emails) which were
                        <em>common</em> to both the Plaintiff and Defendant
                    were not disclosed in the Original list, there could be no certainty that
                    relevant documents which were <em>not common</em> to both
                    parties, had likewise been undisclosed in the Original List. It simply could not
                    know what other relevant documents there were if the Defendant was indeed
                    withholding certain pivotal documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Disputing the relevance of these classes of
                    documents, Ms Tan argued that it had disclosed all relevant documents and
                    had even disclosed those which were not relevant. To the extent that the
                    Defendant had gone further by disclosing documents which were not relevant,
                    Ms Tan argued that it should not be criticized or construed to have fallen
                    short of its discovery obligations. It also submitted that the classes of
                    documents sought had to be relevant to the Plaintiff’s
                pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Para 24/1/7 of <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> states that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Relevance will be determined by reference to the pleadings. However, the
                        relevance of an issue cannot be dictated by a party unilaterally simply by
                        placing its in his pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The passage goes on to add that the pleadings must be in relation to
                    the subject matter of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In my view, most documents generated between a
                    plaintiff and defendant and related parties might be said to have some
                    connection even if tenuous to a dispute and are thus broadly speaking, relevant
                    to the matter at hand. But it cannot be that every single document with an iota
                    of relevance has to be disclosed- apart from the logistical nightmare it may
                    present, it encourages lawyers to be indiscriminating (which is antithetical to
                    the practice of their craft) and certainly does little to assist the court. The
                    test of relevance thus cannot be the be-all and end-all of discovery. Rather, it
                    is necessity that is the focal point in both general and specific discovery.
                    This principle is enshrined in O 24 r 7 and has been judicially
                    expressed by Belinda Ang J in her observations in <em>Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries</em>
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2004] 4 SLR(R) 39 at [37]-[38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ultimate test is whether discovery is necessary for disposing fairly
                        of the proceedings or for saving costs. An assertion that the documents are
                        relevant will not be good enough. Equally, an assertion that the documents
                        are necessary because they are relevant will not be enough. Obviously, if a
                        docment is not relevant, it cannot be necessary for disposing of the cause
                        or matter. On the other hand, documents may be relevant to a case without
                        being necessary to it. The word used in O 24 r 7 is
                        “necessary” and not “desirable” or
                        “relevant”. It is the common experience of ;lawyers and the
                        court that often many documents are produced because they are relevant, but
                        only very few of them are of use.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court is, by O 24 r 7, concerned with the discretion to
                        refuse disclosure of a document unless the necessity for disclosure is
                        clearly demonstrated. In a way, it calls for an exercise in considering and
                        selecting documents or some parts of them. The wider the range of documents
                        requested the more difficult it is for the court to decide whether the
                        documents are necessary for “disposing fairly” of the matter
                        of cause before proceedings are commenced or for “saving
                        costs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, if the documents sought are relevant but not necessary for the
                    fair adjudication of the dispute or to save costs, the court will not order
                    discovery of such documents. Necessity is the key to discovery (see also
                        <em>Ting Kang Chung John v Teo Hee Lai Building Construction
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 54).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the classes of documents sought were relevant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I now return to the classes of documents
                    sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The emails</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The nine emails (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above) were
                    sent by the solicitor from the Defendant law firm having charge of the
                    Plaintiff’s admiralty action to solicitors at C&amp;C and WH. I found that
                    the contents of these emails pertained to housekeeping matters such as the
                    drafting of affidavits and administrative queries; they were irrelevant to the
                    pleadings (although Ms Tan submitted that the Defendant was prepared to
                    file a list of these emails despite disputing their relevancy).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As for the tenth alleged
                    “pivotal” email from the Defendant to WH explaining the Court of
                    Appeal decision, Mr Liew submitted at the hearing that this email was
                    potentially powerful for the Plaintiff as it would allow it to compare the
                    advice given in this email with the advice the Defendant had rendered before the
                    admiralty action commenced. I did not think that this email was relevant to the
                    pleaded case either. The Plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the
                    “cumulative conduct”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> of the Defendant in advising
                    the Plaintiff to commence the admiralty action to arrest the Vessel was a breach
                    of contract and/or negligence. I did not see how the afore-mentioned email was
                    relevant much less necessary, especially when it was an explanation of the Court
                    of Appeal decision to WH.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Correspondence between the Defendants and C&amp;C and CAG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Plaintiff argued in its affidavit that it
                    was “less than clear” whether all the relevant documents in this
                    class had been disclosed in the Original list. In response, the Defendant
                    averred that this request was fishing expedition. It asserted that all relevant
                    correspondence between CAG and itself (which was not copied to the Plaintiffs
                    and/or WH) had already been disclosed. Insofar as there was any advice from the
                    Defendant which was communicated to C&amp;C and subsequently shared with or
                    conveyed to the Plaintiff and/or WH, it submitted that these had also already
                    been specifically pleaded by the Defendant and the relevant correspondence had
                    been disclosed. It further submitted that even if there were undisclosed,
                    relevant documents in this category (which it denied), such documents would
                    belong to CAG whose consent would be required for copies of these documents to
                    be released. Ms Tan submitted that an application for specific discovery
                    would need to be made if this was disputed by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Soh Lup Chee &amp; Ors v
                        Seow Boon Cheng &amp; Anor</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 604
                        (“<em>Soh Lup Chee</em>”) at [9], the
                    High Court remarked that generally, affidavits verifying lists of documents
                    could not be contravened by other contentious affidavits and shall not be
                    subjected to cross-examination. It iterated the general principle that where the
                    court is satisfied from the documents produced that other documents must exist,
                    the party must either produce them or explain on oath what has become of them.
                    It ruled at [11] of its judgment however that the case before it was an
                    exception as the party from whom discovery was sought had “amply
                    demonstrated, through their counsel, the numerous obvious omissions of documents
                    that must surely exist, or to be more precise have existed.” Such was not
                    the case before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It must be borne in mind that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…a party was and is entitled to apply for further and better list,
                        where it appears on the face of the list already served…or on the

                        the party has or had other relevant documents beyond those disclosed. For
                        the purpose of such an application no affidavit is required.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An order may be made for a further and better list of documents where it

<p class="Judg-1">I did not think that any of the above limbs had
                    been fulfilled. It did not appear to me from the Original list or the documents
                    referred in it, nor were there any admissions, that there were relevant
                    documents in this category undisclosed by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Liew also highlighted the case of
                        <em>British Association of Glass Bottle Manufacturers v
                        Nettlefold</em> [1912] 1 KB 369 (“<em>Glass Bottle</em>”) which was cited in <em>Soh
                        Lup Chee</em>. In <em>Glass Bottle</em>,
                    Farwell LJ remarked that the Court could draw inferences that a document in
                    a list implied the existence of a source document. For example, a balance sheet
                    would imply the existence of account books. It naturally followed that if the
                    balance sheet was relevant, then so would the account books. <em>Glass Bottle</em> is however not analogous to the present category of
                    documents as there are no such source documents which can or have been
                    identified. Any inference drawn that there has to be more undisclosed relevant
                    correspondence would be mere speculation which this court would be loathe to
                    engage in. There is no basis for me to think that the Defendant has not
                    fulfilled these discovery obligations under this category.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Court Attendance Notes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In its supporting affidavit, the Plaintiff in
                    regard to this class of documents simply asserted that it did not know if all
                    attendance notes of all hearings had been disclosed. The Defendant submitted
                    that it had already voluntarily disclosed court attendances notes and emails in
                    its Original list, even though not all were relevant to the issues in the
                    action. It averred that it had already been generous in giving discovery by
                    disclosing in its Original list documents which were not relevant to the
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     At this juncture, I would point out that
                    first, such a position generates confusion. I concurred with Mr Liew that
                    the Plaintiff cannot vacillate in this manner by disclosing documents which it
                    said were not relevant and then insisting on withholding documents for the same
                    reason, <em>i.e</em>. that they were not relevant. It is a
                    logically inconsistent and untenable position to adopt. Second, generosity of
                    disclosure is wholly irrelevant in discovery. The bedrock requirement as I have
                    discussed earlier, is necessity. Simply because a party considers itself as
                    having been generous does not mean that further disclosure is never warranted.
                    One must be “generous” with the right type of documents. I hasten
                    to add though, that generosity in discovery is to be desired only insofar as the
                    party giving discovery is not withholding any documents which are relevant and
                    necessary for the fair resolution of the dispute or for saving
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     For completeness, I would point out that the
                    Plaintiff cannot now or later apply to have the supposedly irrelevant documents
                    removed from the Original list unless they are privileged (<em>Ser Kim Koi and another v Fulton William Merrell and others</em>
                    [2008] 2 SLR(R)1063). For now, these alleged irrelevant documents must be
                    presumed to be relevant (see also Chapter XXIIA Part 9 para [542] of
                        <em>Civil Practice in Singapore and Malaysia</em>,
                    Jeffrey Pinsler SC (Lexis Nexis, 2009)) (“<em>Civil
                        Practice</em>”). Indeed, a list of documents verified by
                    affidavit is taken to be conclusive and the documents listed therein presumed to
                    be relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the court will assume against the party making the list, at least
                        until the contrary is shown, that the documents in the list are all relevant
                        and liable to production.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(para 24/3/1 of <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em>)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no practical purpose served in
                    disclosing irrelevant documents and as the above extracts show it is pointless
                    for the Defendant to now say that it has disclosed irrelevant
                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Defendant has identified a Court
                    Attendance Note dated 3 August 2006 which was not disclosed in its Original
                    list. This note related to an appeal hearing before Tan Lee Meng J. The
                    Defendant disputed its relevance to the pleaded issues but I express a contrary
                    view. Court attendance notes where the Plaintiff was represented by the
                    Defendant will be relevant and necessary insofar as they evinced the
                    Defendant’s conduct of the dispute before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Non-Court Attendance Notes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Documents sought under this class were
                    “attendance notes of meetings, telephone conversations, <em>etc</em> between the Defendants and Clyde &amp; Co (Singapore
                    and UK) and Waterson Hicks.” The Plaintiff averred that as these
                    documents would “show what the Defendants were told and what they
                    advised, they are relevant”. Save for two attendance notes involving WH
                    or the Plaintiff dated 13 June 2006 and 29 September 2006
                    respectively, the Defendant submitted that none of its other attendance notes
                    involved WH or the Plaintiff and these notes were thus not disclosed. It further
                    argued that these two attendance notes related to two telephone calls which had
                    occurred <em>after</em> the arrest of the ship and hence
                    did not relate to the “cumulative conduct of the Defendants in advising
                    the Plaintiff to commence the admiralty action.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I have seen the afore-mentioned attendance
                    notes and believe that they are relevant and necessary for the fair adjudication
                    of the suit. In my view, the “cumulative conduct” of the Defendant
                    in advising the Plaintiff to proceed with the admiralty action cannot be
                    construed to refer only to the advice given at the initial stage, <em>i.e</em>. when the Plaintiff was advised to proceed with the
                    admiralty action. It also extends to the Defendant’s conduct subsequent to
                    the rendering of such advice. However, where a document and its content are so
                    far removed from the subject matter of the dispute, it is unlikely to be
                    relevant at least for the purposes of an application under general discovery.
                    Whether a document is far removed from the crux of the dispute is a matter of
                    discretion for the Court. I find that the two non-court attendance notes were
                    discoverable. Any other non-court attendance notes involving the Defendant and
                    Plaintiff and/or WH would also be discoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Internal Notes and Memoranda</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Written communications between various lawyers
                    of the Defendant firm in the form of memoranda or emails were sought as well.
                    The Plaintiff’s basis for the disclosure of such documents was that these
                    documents were relevant in showing “what the Defendants knew, how strong
                    they believed the Plaintiff’s case was, their internal discussion, what
                    their respective views were etcetera.” Suffice to say, I do not see any
                    “demonstrable nexus” (<em>Dante</em> at [20]
                    and [28]) between the Defendant’s subjective state of mind and the
                    Plaintiff’s pleaded case for the purposes of O 24 r 1. I concur
                    with the Defendant’s submission that the Defendant’s privately held
                    views and beliefs as to the strength of the Plaintiff’s case was not an
                    issue on the pleadings. What is relevant is the advice rendered to the Plaintiff
                    at the material time, not the ruminations of the Defendant’s
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In sum, I am of the view that the following
                    classes of documents: (i) court attendance notes where the Defendant had acted
                    for the Plaintiff and (ii) non-court attendance notes generated between the
                    Defendant, Plaintiff and/or WH, are relevant to the pleaded case and necessary
                    for the fair resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I hereby order that a further and better list
                    of documents verified by affidavit be furnished to the Plaintiff in respect of
                    (i) and (ii) within 7 days of my order. Each party is to bear its own costs. It
                    remains for me to thank Mr Liew and Ms Tan for their efforts and
                    spirited submissions.</p>
