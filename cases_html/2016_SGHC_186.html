The Defendant and the second Plaintiff were the siblings based in Singapore, while the first, third and fourth Plaintiffs were based overseas in India and Canada. The Plaintiffs commenced a claim for a total sum of S$1.05m owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs pursuant to a compromise agreement made in December 2010. The Plaintiffs also claimed that the Defendant was acting as trustee de son tort, and in the alternative, as a constructive trustee for their late father’s estate in Singapore, and had breached fiduciary duties. They thus sought an account of the profits obtained or received by the Defendant as a result of his breaches. The Defendant counterclaimed for his share as a beneficiary of both his late father and mother’s estates from the Plaintiffs, who he alleged were acting as constructive trustees of the estates, as well as for properties in the Plaintiffs’ names in India.

</div> The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to make the payment of S$1.05m to them, and also failed to give them their share of the one-ninth of sale proceeds of the Property after selling it. This was the basis upon which they had commenced S 141/2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Defendant attempted to argue belatedly in his closing submissions that the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over S 141/2012. The basis for doing so was three-fold. First, Indian intestacy laws (specifically, Hindu succession laws) should apply to the entire dispute as the Compromise Agreement also involved the settlement of properties in India and matters of distribution of intestate assets. Second, based on the rule in <span class="font-italic">British South Africa Company v Companhia de Moçambique</span> [1893] AC 602 (“the Moçambique rule”), the Singapore court had no jurisdiction over issues of title to the foreign immovable properties.

</div> Third, the Defendant also appeared to argue that the fact that there were on-going proceedings between the same parties in India regarding KRLP and Valli’s estates indicated that Singapore was not the more appropriate forum for ventilating the dispute and so the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I was unconvinced by these arguments. The Plaintiffs’ claim in S 141/2012 did not relate to Indian properties, but rather, was specific to the late KRLP’s interests in Singapore. It was the Defendant’s counterclaim that brought in the issue of the distribution of both KRLP and Valli’s properties in India. If the Defendant chose to bring the Indian properties into the consideration of S 141/2012 from the beginning, then it did not lie in his mouth to argue at the end of the hearing that the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the matter simply because it involved the Indian properties. The Defendant mentioned the nationality and domicile of the late KRLP and Valli in the closing submissions as support for his argument that Indian intestacy laws should apply to S 141/2012, but I was not persuaded as to how they were relevant connecting factors to decide what relevant law was applicable. Even if it were true that Indian intestacy laws applied to the entire dispute, it would not be an immediate bar to this court exercising jurisdiction over the dispute, as this court could apply Indian law in the resolution of S 141/2012. On a proper characterisation of the issues in S 141/2012, it appeared that the main issues in S 141/2012 were contractual in nature (relating to the validity, formation and interpretation of the Compromise Agreement), so the applicable test in determining the governing law for the dispute would be the three-stage test set out in <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v Turegum Insurance Co</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 285 at [82], and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and Another Appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR 491 at [36]. However, the analysis as to the right choice of law for dealing with the Compromise Agreement as well as S 141/2012 was rendered moot as the Defendant had failed to plead that Indian law applied to S 141/2012, and had also failed to prove the content of Indian law in that respect. Absent such proof, the law of the forum, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law, should be applied by default unless to do so would be unjust and inconvenient (see <span class="font-italic">D’Oz International Pte Ltd v PSB Corp Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2010] 3 SLR 267 at [25]<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [58]). In the present case, given that the Defendant only raised the applicability of Indian law belatedly in his closing submissions, I was of the view that Singapore law should apply to S 141/2012.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On the point regarding the Moçambique rule, I accepted that a Singapore court generally cannot make a judgment <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against the Indian properties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, determining the rightful title to the Indian properties as against the whole world (see <span class="font-italic">Pattni v Ali</span> [2007] 2 AC 85 at [21] as cited in <span class="font-italic">Murakami </span><span class="font-italic">Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi Murakami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 565 at [32]).

The Defendant admitted in cross-examination that he had gone to the ancestral home once on 27 December 2010, and then for the family meeting that took place over 28 and 29 December 2010.

</div> I found this explanation rather unbelievable because it made no sense for the Plaintiffs to abuse the Defendant when he had already signed the Compromise Agreement. The Defendant’s reliance on these acts as acts of duress made no sense at all if this purported duress had occurred after the signing of the Compromise Agreement, the very act he claimed he was coerced into. Further, I found it difficult to believe that Muthu would have made up the numbers regarding the Moneylending Business. He had no knowledge of the Moneylending Business to begin with and was merely an outsider brought in to divide the assets based on information provided by the parties. The information in the Compromise Agreement regarding the Moneylending Business was unlikely to have been included without the Defendant’s input, and I found it difficult to believe that he was forced by Muthu to concoct those accounts. In fact, he admitted on cross-examination that he would send the accounting books of the Moneylending Business back to India regularly, though he had the books for 2010, and eventually brought them to the family meeting on 28 December 2010 where he handed them to the Plaintiffs.

</div> As for the medical report by the psychiatrist, I noted that it was not proffered to prove a causative relationship between the Defendant’s anxiety and the duress.

</div> It made no sense either for KRLP’s Moneylending Business to bear the expenses of the Defendant’s separate moneylending business as some form of incentive to the Defendant when the Defendant was running a business that was in direct competition with the family’s. I also found it unconvincing that the Defendant could manage two separate sets of clients with different interest rates for loans when he eventually operated out of the same location. He claimed that he had charged the lower interest of 18% under the licensed business and the higher and illegal interest rate of 36% under KRLP’s Moneylending Business, and these were entirely separate sets of clients who did not know the existence of the other concurrent business.

Thus, the Compromise Agreement did not relate to the transfer of an illegal interest, as the Defendant sought to argue.

The breaches of duties alleged by the Plaintiffs related to the Defendant’s failure to provide the Moneylending Business’s accounts shortly after March 2010.
