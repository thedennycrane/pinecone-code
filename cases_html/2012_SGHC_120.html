<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This Originating Summons No
                    422 of 2011 (“OS 422/2011”) is the Chief
                    Assessor’s appeal against the decision of the
                    Valuation Review Board (“the Board”) made on
                    24 May 2011 (“the
                Decision”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       There is no dispute as to
                    the relevant facts underlying the valuations in dispute. The
                    Respondent, HSBC Institutional Trust Services (“the
                    Landlord”), is the trustee of CapitalMall Trust which
                    owns the shopping centre known as Bugis
                Junction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Bugis Junction has 180 units
                    which are normally leased to tenants carrying on various
                    types of businesses at the shopping centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the computation of the
                    annual value of the various tenanted units (collectively
                    “the Premises”) for the valuation years of
                    2004 and 2005, the Chief Assessor did not exclude a portion
                    in the gross rent for depreciation arising from wear and
                    tear of escalators, lifts, air-conditioning and fire safety
                    systems installed in Bugis Junction (hereinafter referred to
                    collectively as “the asset items” or
                    individually as “the asset
                item”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Board’s Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Dissatisfied with the
                    assessment made by the Chief Assessor, the Landlord appealed
                    to the Board. The Board accepted the Landlord’s
                    contention and ruled that the claim for depreciation was a
                    constituent part of the total cost of the services provided
                    by the Landlord, and that it should be excluded from gross
                    rent in the determination of annual value for the relevant
                    tax years (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> &amp;
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Ms Tan Gee Hong (“Ms
                    Tan”), the property manager, testified before the
                    Board. She explained in her affidavit that the tenants paid
                    the Landlord a monthly gross rent that included a sum of
                    $0.20 per square foot calculated on the basis of a 7.5%
                    annual depreciation for air-conditioning plant, lifts and
                    escalators, and 20% for the fire safety system. It was Ms
                    Tan’s evidence that the Landlord had contracted to let
                    out the Premises located in a building with central air
                    conditioning, escalators, lifts, and a fire safety system,
                    and that the asset items were required to provide the
                    services agreed to by the Landlord, and for that reason the
                    claim for depreciation was an expense that related to
                    services rather than rent or letting. She confirmed that
                    this monthly sum of $0.20 per square foot was an integral
                    part of gross rent but its purpose was not itemised in the
                    tenancy agreements; that it was for depreciation in relation
                    to the asset items; that the monthly service charge of $1.50
                    per square foot was to cover operating expenses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and not depreciation of
                    the asset items. It was argued on behalf of the Landlord
                    that the Premises would yield higher rental as compared to a
                    shopping mall without similar installations like central
                    air-conditioning, lifts, escalators and fire safety
                    systems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Ms Tan’s evidence was
                    not seriously challenged by the Chief Assessor who did not
                    call any witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Board referred to
                        <em>BCH Retail Investment Pte Ltd v Chief
                        Assessor</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 580
                        (“<em>BCH( No
                        2)”</em>) for the principle that any
                    component of gross rent that was for services and not
                    related to rent must be excluded from the gross rent for
                    purposes of calculating annual value. With that principle in
                    mind, the Board accepted the Landlord’s reasoning and
                    stated (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the first place the items in question were required
                        to provide the services to the tenants. The [Landlord]
                        would have to incur actual and notional expenditure,
                        which refers to the depreciation of the equipment.
                        Undoubtedly, these items cannot last forever and not
                        only require maintenance but need replacement due to
                        wear and tear. ... [T]he underlying premise remain (sic)
                        that the [Landlord] would require these items to provide
                        services to the tenants which they are contractually
                        bound to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In coming to its decision,
                    the Board followed <em>Chartered Bank v The
                        City Council of Singapore</em> [1959] SPTC 1
                        (“<em>Chartered
                    Bank</em>”), a decision of Wee Chong Jin J (as
                    he then was). In that case, Wee J excluded the cost of
                    services and the landlord’s profit for providing those
                    services from the gross rent to determine annual value. In
                    addition, the learned judge allowed for the exclusion of
                    depreciation of equipment (lifts, air conditioners and fire
                    extinguishers) from gross rent as well. The Board observed:
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A plain reading of the Chartered Bank case would be an
                        implicit awareness of the learned judge that
                        depreciation was a concept which he recognised and which
                        ought to be excluded from the gross rent, if it had been
                        so included, for the purposes of calculating annual
                        value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Applying <em>Chartered Bank</em> to the factual matrix
                    of this particular case, the Board agreed (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... that the depreciation of the [asset] items
                        constituted part of the total cost of services and since
                        the gross rents were formulated taking into
                        consideration the depreciation, this ought to be
                        excluded in the computation of the annual value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Having concluded in favour
                    of the Landlord that the amount claimed for depreciation of
                    the asset items (<em>ie</em>, the
                    notional expense) was part of the total cost of services and
                    that it related to services rather than rent, the Board
                    considered it irrelevant and saw no merit and legal
                    implication in the Chief Assessor’s contention that
                    the asset items were permanent features and as an integral
                    part of the building in Bugis Junction were assessable to
                    property tax together with the building.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OS 422/2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     OS 422/2011 is brought
                    pursuant to s 35 of the Property Tax Act (Cap 254, 2005 Rev
                    Ed) (“the PTA”). It was agreed between the
                    parties that the question of law for this appeal is whether,
                    as a matter of principle, a component in the gross rent for
                    depreciation of the asset items (<em>ie</em>, escalators and lifts, air conditioning
                    and fire safety systems) should be excluded from gross rent
                    in the computation of annual value. This question requires a
                    determination of what the annual value of the Premises is
                    according to the definition of “annual value”
                    in s 2(1) of the PTA, which focuses on the element of rent
                    or letting. Some additional questions will necessarily flow
                    from this definition read with s 2(2), as well as the
                    charging provision in s 6(1) of the PTA, and they will be
                    identified and discussed later in this
                Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is appropriate at this
                    juncture to set out the relevant statutory provisions. The
                    charging provision of the PTA is s 6(1) which
                    provides:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Chief Assessor’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Chief Assessor submits
                    that the Board erred in allowing the exclusion of a portion
                    of the gross rent for depreciation in the computation of
                    annual value. First, the Chief Assessor argues that the
                    Board had focussed on the wrong question, <em>viz</em>, whether the Landlord required the asset
                    items to provide services to the tenants. It was an error
                    that distracted it from what the Chief Assessor considers to
                    be the correct approach pronounced by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>BCH (No 2)</em>, <em>viz</em>, whether the portion of the
                    gross rent for depreciation is related to rent or
                        letting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Second, the Board was wrong to have ruled as irrelevant its
                    own findings that the asset items were permanent features
                    and, hence, an integral part of the building. Third,
                        <em>Chartered Bank</em> provides
                    little guidance on whether, as a matter of principle, the
                    depreciation of the asset items ought to be excluded from
                    gross rent in arriving at the annual value of the Premises
                    for the valuation years 2004 and 2005. There was no
                        <em>ratio decidendi</em> in that
                    case to give it binding authority to resolve the problem in
                    the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Landlord’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Landlord submits that
                    the Board was correct in holding that the claim for
                    depreciation ought to be excluded from the gross rent in
                    order to arrive at the annual value of the Premises. The
                    Landlord’s argument is that as depreciation
                    constituted part of the total cost of the services provided
                    and the gross rent was formulated with the depreciation in
                    mind, it ought to be excluded from the gross rent in order
                    to arrive at the annual value of the property. <em>Chartered Bank</em> and <em>BCH (No 2)</em> were cited in
                        support.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Finally, the Landlord
                    accepts that the asset items are in the nature of plant and
                    machinery, but disagrees that they formed “integral
                    parts of the building”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    Landlord, the Board rightly decided (at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the point made by [the Chief Assessor] that all the
                        items are permanent features of the building and hence
                        an integral part of the building, we are of the view
                        that this is irrelevant. Just because an escalator form
                        (sic) a permanent feature of the building does not
                        necessarily mean it cannot remain an equipment at the
                        same time, and whose moving parts must be replaced over
                        time due to wear and tear. The case of <em>People’s Park Chinatown Development
                            Pte Ltd v Schindler Lifts (Singapore) Pte
                            Ltd</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 236, ...was
                        in a different context and turned on the passing of
                        property or title of escalators which had been installed
                        but not paid for. It provided little guidance to the
                        issue at hand as to whether depreciation ought to be
                        excluded in the computation of the annual value of the
                        property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Chief Assessor in
                    computing the annual value of the Premises started with the
                    gross rent received by the Landlord. No point was taken that
                    depreciation was never included in gross rent to begin with.
                    The Chief Assessor did not challenge Ms Tan’s evidence
                    that although the annual depreciation of the asset items was
                    not itemised separately in the tenancy agreements, the gross
                    rent, however, was negotiated and formulated with
                    depreciation of the asset items in mind. The main arguments
                    that were canvassed before the Board were repeated in this
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The question of law in
                    this appeal is whether, as a matter of principle, the
                    depreciation component in the gross rent should be excluded
                    from gross rent in the computation of annual value of the
                    property. In assessing annual value the touchstone is
                    whether a component in the gross rent is related to rent or
                    letting (“the touchstone question”). This is
                    in turn determined by whether the machinery or equipment to
                    which a component in the gross rent is directed is part of
                    the property that is assessable to tax (“the
                    threshold question”). It is, therefore, necessary to
                    first determine the threshold question to ascertain whether
                    the asset items in the present case are fixtures in or on
                    immoveable property so as to be potentially assessable to
                    tax together with the immoveable property under s 6(1) of
                    the PTA. If the answer is in the affirmative, the next step
                    is to look at the touchstone question. At this stage, the
                    question of law in this appeal will be
                considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Depreciation as defined in
                    the Financial Reporting Standards FRS 16<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> is the systematic allocation
                    of the depreciable amount of an asset (<em>ie</em>, the cost of an asset, or other amount
                    substituted for cost, less its residual value) over its
                    useful life. Put simply, depreciation serves to match a fair
                    proportion of the cost of an asset against income earned by
                    a business in an accounting period as well as reflect the
                    book value of the asset used in the business at each
                    accounting period end. In this case, the Landlord has
                    described depreciation as a “notional expense”
                    for wear and tear of the asset items that would need to be
                    replaced in the future, and this is usually at the end of
                    the useful life of the asset item. On the matter of
                    depreciation, the Board in its Decision stated (at [14]): <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the [Landlord] would have to incur actual and
                        notional expenditure, which refers to depreciation of
                        the equipment. Undoubtedly, these items cannot last
                        forever and not only require maintenance but need
                        replacement due to wear and tear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In this appeal, the
                    parties’ focus was on the touchstone question (see
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). If it
                    is adjudged in this appeal that depreciation is not part of
                    the total cost of services, it does not necessarily result
                    in an outcome favourable to the Chief Assessor because the
                    opposing views are, strictly, not different sides of the
                    same coin such that if one view fails the other
                    automatically prevails. As noted by the Chief Assessor, the
                    Board had focused on the wrong question and should instead
                    have asked whether the depreciation component in the gross
                    rent related to rental or letting. The outcome of this
                    appeal depends on whether the asset items are fixtures and,
                    as fixtures, are assessable to tax together with the
                    building that comprises the shopping centre, Bugis Junction.
                    As fixtures, the asset items can enhance the value of a
                    building, and they are to be taken into consideration in
                    assessing annual value. From this perspective, the relevance
                    of the asset items as fixtures to the question on appeal is
                    clear: depreciation has something to do with <em>letting</em> of the Premises which, in
                    turn, means that the depreciation component in the gross
                    rent is related to rent or letting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the same time, the
                    Landlord’s use of the phrase “notional
                    expense” to denote depreciation of the asset items
                    due to wear and tear gives rise to complications. The term
                    depreciation invites discussion on whether depreciation as
                    “notional expense” or depreciation in the form
                    of a notional provision for future replacement cost of the
                    asset items is within the ambit of the qualifying words in s
                    2(1) of the PTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With these observations in
                    mind, I now turn to examine the Board’s
                    Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the Board’s Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Board erred in several
                    respects. Firstly, the Board did not consider whether the
                    asset items were potentially assessable to tax together with
                    the subject building under s 6(1) of the PTA. Under our
                    local property tax regime, tax is payable on immoveable
                    properties such as houses, buildings, lands and tenements.
                    In other words, it is the immoveable property that is taxed.
                    Thus, a building is assessable together with fixtures that
                    are on or in the building unless the fixtures are
                    manufacturing or industrial machinery exempted under s 2(2)
                    of the PTA. The Board found that the asset items were
                    fixtures and, hence, part of the building, but nevertheless
                    ruled that its findings were irrelevant and had no
                    application in law to this case. With respect, the
                    Board’s reasoning in the context of this particular
                    case is misconceived. It detracted from settled
                    jurisprudence in land law on the distinction between
                    chattels and fixtures. Consequently, it cast aside the
                    statutory imposition of tax on fixtures in or on immoveable
                    property in the determining what constitutes
                    “building” for property tax assessment (see
                    generally Andrew Phang JA in <em>Pan-United Marine Ltd v Chief Assessor</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 569 (“<em>Pan-United</em>”) at [104] and Phang
                    JA’s passing comment at [43] that a “building” would
                    by its nature and definition constitute part of the land),
                    or if outside the definition of “building”,
                    the asset items could still be affixed to land so as to
                    become part of the land and, thus be potentially assessable
                    to tax (see <em>Chief Assessor and another v
                        First DCS Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 724 at [46] (“<em>First DCS
                        (CA)</em>”). By skipping this important
                    step of the analysis, the Board arrived at the wrong
                    conclusion in answer to the question of law before the
                    Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the sake of
                    completeness, I should add that there may be occasions where
                    on the facts it is possible to skip the threshold question
                    to go straight into assessment of annual value (but not so
                    in this case based on the present facts). To illustrate, in
                        <em>BCH (No 2)</em>, the Court of
                    Appeal sanctioned the use of the gross rent as a
                    starting-point to see if there are components not related to
                    rent or letting. The dispute on advertising and promotional
                    (“A&amp;P”) contributions and its resolution
                    is unconnected to the threshold question described in
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above.
                    Similarly, in <em>BCH Retail Investment Pte
                        Ltd v Chief Assessor</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 973 (“<em>BCH (No
                        1)</em>”), the dispute related to the
                    tenants’ A&amp;P contributions. In <em>BCH (No 2)</em>, Andrew Phang JA said (at
                        [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having regard to the analysis and (more importantly)
                        general principles laid down above, <em>the correct approach to adopt in the present
                            proceedings</em> (as in <em>BCH
                            (No 1)</em>) would be to first ascertain
                        whether or not the gross rent adopted as a starting
                        point includes any elements that ought <em>not</em> to be included. If, in fact,
                        there are such elements, then their value ought to be
                            <em>excluded</em> for the
                        purposes of computing the annual value. The corollary of
                        such an approach is that where expenses have been
                        incurred, but which have had nothing to do with rent or
                        letting and have not been included in the gross rent,
                        they are not to be considered at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Secondly, and this follows
                    from the first error, the Board’s focus on services
                    led it to decide that its finding that the asset items were
                    fixtures and an integral part of the building that comprises
                    Bugis Junction was irrelevant to the issue before it.
                    Contrary to the Board’s views, as fixtures to the
                    building the asset items are relevant to the question of
                    including them in the assessment of the building’s
                    annual value. As the asset items are assessable to tax
                    together with the building, in assessing annual value it
                    cannot be said that depreciation of the asset items has
                    nothing to do with <em>letting</em> of
                    the Premises. This, in turn, means that the depreciation
                    component in the gross rent is related to rent or
                    letting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Thirdly, the Board’s
                    ruling that a portion of the gross rent for depreciation was
                    related to the total cost of services is wrong. In this
                    case, the Board answered the question whether the claim for
                    depreciation related to rent or letting by noting that the
                    provision of the asset items related to the Landlord’s
                    contractual obligation to provide services to its tenants,
                    and that without the asset items, those services could not
                    have been provided. I disagree with this reasoning. The mere
                    fact that there is a contractual obligation to provide
                    services is neither here nor there. One reason why the
                    Board’s ruling is unsound in law is that the
                    Board’s decision is inconsistent with the principle
                    that the statutory definition of annual value bespeaks of a
                    hypothetical tenancy. The mode of finding out the annual
                    value is laid down in the PTA, and it is to ascertain the
                    rent which a hypothetical tenant (not <em>the</em> tenant) taking one year with another
                    might reasonably be expected to pay. Even a property
                    occupied by its owner is still subject to property tax, but
                    the ascertainment of annual value there will be a
                    hypothetical exercise. It is clear from <em>BCH (No 2)</em> that Parliament did not make the
                    annual value of a property dependent on the terms on which
                    the property was <em>actually</em> let,
                    but upon the notion of a hypothetical tenant. Furthermore,
                    the rent actually paid is only <em>prima
                        facie</em> evidence but not conclusive evidence of
                    the rent at which the premises might reasonably be expected
                    to be let. The proposition – that the actual rent is
                    only <em>prima facie</em> evidence of
                    the gross rent on which to arrive at the true annual value
                    – may be rebutted or supported by other evidence. It
                    is precisely because the gross rent might, <em>on the actual facts</em>, comprise
                    elements that have nothing to do with rent or letting that
                    they have to be excluded (see <em>BCH (No
                        2)</em> at [24]). After alluding to the fact-sensitive
                    dictates of any particular case such as <em>Chartered Bank</em>, Phang JA remarked (at
                    24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Certainly, whilst not necessarily conclusive, we would
                        highlight that the actual rent paid would often be an
                        important factor and/or starting-point in the assessment
                        of the annual value of the property concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Fourthly, apart from the
                    similarity of the facts in <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em> and in this case, it is difficult to be
                    sure of the legal principle enunciated in the former
                    decision that excluded depreciation from gross rent in the
                    computation of annual value. It seems to me that the Board
                    accepted and applied <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em> to the present case basically because
                    the facts in <em>Chartered Bank</em>
                    were similar. It is noticeable that the rates of
                    depreciation were, coincidentally, the same in both cases.
                    For instance, in <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em>, depreciation of lifts and air
                    conditioners were stated as 7½% of cost and fire
                    extinguishers at 20% of cost. In this case, the same rate of
                    7.5% was used for the more modern central air conditioning
                    system, lifts and escalators and 20% for the fire safety
                    system (as opposed to “fire extinguishers” in
                    1959). As a matter of impression, the story-board, one
                    reasonably suspects, was for the sole purpose of enabling
                    the Landlord to argue that the facts fall within the
                    decision of that case. Be that as it may, the
                    Landlord’s contention that <em>Chartered Bank</em> is now binding authority
                    because Phang JA approved it in <em>BCH</em> (No 2) is misplaced. I do not agree with
                    the Landlord’s submissions that the <em>Chartered Bank</em> case was expressly approved
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>BCH (No
                        2)</em>. Phang JA did not have in mind the same
                    question before this court in the earlier case, nor was he
                    expressing approval of the point for decision in this OS
                    422/2011. Passages from <em>BCH (No
                        2)</em> to which reference have been made do not
                    bear out the assertions. In fact, in a subsequent case,
                        <em>Tan Hee </em><em>Liang v Chief Assessor</em> [2009]
                    1 SLR(R) 335 (<em>“Tan Hee
                        </em><em>Liang
                    (CA)</em>”), counsel for the Chief Assessor
                    invited Phang JA sitting in the Court of Appeal to consider
                    the correctness of the <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em> case (see [35] of the Judgment). As it transpired, it
                    was not necessary in that case for the appellate court to
                    take up the call of the Chief Assessor. That said, the fact
                    that <em>Chartered Bank</em> was
                    decided as far back as 1959, that it probably has since been
                    acted upon, and that it has been referred to in later cases
                    without express disapproval are not reasons why it should
                    not be questioned and even disregarded if that case is of no
                    value as a binding authority on the issue in this appeal. I
                    will be discussing the <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em> case in detail later on in this
                    Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Immoveable Property is assessable to tax –
                what of permanent fixtures in or on the property?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In this part of the
                    judgment, I will consider the threshold question:
                    “Are the asset items an integral part of the subject
                    building, such that the building together with the asset
                    items is assessable to tax under s 6(1)?” There is no
                    doubt that property tax is a tax on immoveable property, and
                    any plant and machinery in or on such property is assessable
                    to tax if the plant and machinery is affixed so as to become
                    part of the immoveable property. The significance of the
                    existence of fixtures in a building is potentially the
                    enhancement in value that is added to the annual value of
                    the building. Conversely, if the plant and machinery is not
                    affixed to the building, the question of including it in the
                    assessment of the building’s annual value does not
                    even arise. Hence, the difference between fixtures and
                    chattels is important in relation to the calculation of the
                    annual value for property tax purposes. Section 2(2) of the
                    PTA is relevant in that not all fixtures are taken into
                    account in determining the annual value. Certain types of
                    machinery, especially trade machinery, are excluded from
                    computation of the annual value of the subject
                    premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The decision of <em>First DCS Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor and
                        another</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 326
                        (“<em>First
                    DCS</em>”) is instructive. Andrew Ang J
                    explained s 2(2) of the PTA at [27] &amp; [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[27]  In contrast, under s
                            2(2) of the Act, only machinery used for the

                            articles is excluded from assessment. In general, as
                            property tax is a tax on immoveable property,
                            machinery on such property is not assessable unless
                            such machinery is affixed so as to become part of
                            the immoveable property. If machinery is so affixed,
                            the annual value of such immoveable property will be
                            enhanced owing to such machinery. Section 2(2) of
                            the Act provides relief in that the enhancement in
                            value due to qualifying machinery used for the
                            purposes stated therein is not to be taken into
                            account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[28]  The
                            question then arises: what was the

                            certain kinds of machinery? Although no express
                            statement in this regard may be found, it seems to
                            be likely that the object behind s 2(2) was to
                            encourage investments in plant and machinery for
                            manufacturing, processing and other industrial
                            purposes. As such, a distinction may be made between

                            class include lifts and air-conditioning

                        now examine whether the machinery in the present case
                        qualifies under any of the limbs in s 2(2) of the
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I pause here to mention
                    that Ang J’s distinction between two separate classes
                    of machinery in s 2(2) was accepted by the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>First DCS </em><em>(CA)</em>. VK Rajah JA (delivering the
                    decision of the court), agreeing with Ang J on fixtures on
                    or in immoveable property, said (at [46]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As pointed out by the Judge at [27] of the Judgment,
                        for machinery on immoveable property to be potentially
                        assessable for property tax, it must first be affixed to
                        the property such that it is part of the property. Even
                        if the machinery does not come under the definition of
                        “building”, it could still be affixed to
                        land so as to become part of the land and, thus, be
                        potentially assessable. Whether or not the machinery is
                        such a scenario is actually to be included when
                        assessing the land’s annual value will depend on
                        whether the machinery falls under s 2(2) of the PTA.
                        This has nothing to do with the definition of
                        “building” in s 2(1) of the PTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I now turn to Ang
                    J’s confirmation that escalators, lifts and
                    air-conditioning units would fall under the second category
                    of non-manufacturing or processing or industrial machinery.
                    The significance and effect of this confirmation is that
                    this second category of non-exempted machinery is in fact
                    fixtures in or on the immoveable property and are, thus,
                    included in the assessment of the building’s annual
                    value. This leaves the fire safety system in the present
                    case. I should imagine this also falls under the same
                    category of non-exempted machinery as escalators, lifts and
                    air-conditioning units. Fire safety systems comprise
                    different parts: indicator panels, alarms, sprinklers, heat
                    sensors, hose reels, systems of piping forming part of the
                    fire safety equipment of the building. As the Board found on
                    the facts in evidence, the asset items were fixtures and
                    they formed integral parts of the building. Therefore, the
                    asset items for property tax purposes are part of immoveable
                    property and, hence, are to be included in the assessment of
                    the immoveable property’s annual value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Ang J also considered the
                    factors to be considered when determining whether an item is
                    a fixture or a chattel for property tax purposes (at
                        [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general rule at common law is that
                        everything substantially attached to land is part of the
                        land: <em>quicquid </em><em>plantatur solo, solo cedit</em>.
                        However, the rule is subject to two exceptions. Megarry
                        &amp; Wade, <em>The Law of Real
                            Property</em> (Charles Harpum gen ed) (Sweet
                        &amp; Maxwell, 6<sup>th</sup> ed, 2000)
                        at para 14-314, describes them as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">First, certain kinds of chattels were held to
                            remain chattels even after annexation, if the
                            purpose of the annexation is for the better
                            enjoyment of the object as a chattel rather than to
                            improve the land permanently. Secondly, even though
                            an object was clearly a fixture and therefore part
                            of the land, a tenant for years or for life was
                            allowed to sever and remove it if he had annexed it
                            to the land for certain purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the later case of
                        <em>Pan-United</em>, the Court of
                    Appeal had occasion to discuss the fixture test and the
                    enhancement test. In that case, the appellate court did not
                    apply either of the tests as the structure in question was
                    found to be within the meaning of “building”
                    in the PTA and, therefore, taxable. It is pertinent to note
                    that once the structure in question was determined to be a
                    building the inquiry comes to an end. Consequently, the
                    Court of Appeal made no authoritative decision as to which
                    of the tests should be applied to ascertain if the plant and
                    machinery was affixed to land for the purposes of tax under
                    the PTA. However, the appellate court’s <em>obiter</em> remarks at [43] to [53] are instructive on
                    the application of each test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As a starting point, the
                    appellate court cited the English decision of <em>Holland v Hodgson</em>
                    [1872] LR 7 CP 328 as authority that the two
                    considerations for determining whether objects are fixtures
                    or chattels are: (a) the degree of annexation; and (b) the
                    object of annexation. In regard to the object of annexation,
                    the observations made by the English High Court in the
                    decision of <em>Hamp v Bygrave</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second test is: What was the purpose of the
                        annexation? Was it in order to enjoy the chattel as a
                        chattel or was it to improve the freehold in a permanent
                        way? There is, in my judgment, authority for the
                        following propositions: (a) Items which are firmly fixed
                        to the land may yet remain chattels if (1) the purpose
                        of the annexation was to enjoy them as chattels and (2)
                        the degree of annexation was no more than was necessary
                        for that purpose. See <em>Re de Falbe,
                            Ward v Taylor</em> [1901] 1 Ch 523, which was
                        a case concerning valuable tapestries. (b) Articles
                        which are intended to improve, in the sense of being a
                        feature of, the land though their annexation is by no
                        more than their own weight may be regarded as fixtures.
                        See <em>D’Eyncourt v
                            Gregory</em> (1866) LR 3 Eq 382. (c) <em>While the earlier law attached greater
                            importance to the mode and degree of annexation,
                            more recent authorities suggest that the relative
                            importance of their considerations has declined and
                            that the purpose of the annexation is now of first
                            importance.</em> In judging the purpose of
                        annexation regard must be had to all the circumstances,
                        including the manner of annexation and the intention of
                        the annexor or occupier of the land at the relevant
                        time. See <em>Leigh v Taylor</em>
                        [1902] AC 157. (d) Nevertheless, in the absence of
                        evidence of a contrary intention, the prima facie
                        inference to be drawn from the mode and degree of
                        annexation will not be displaced ...</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Phang JA (delivering the
                    Judgment of the Court of Appeal) also approved of the
                    summary of the fixture test in Kevin Gray &amp; Susan
                    Francis Gray, <em>Elements of Land
                        Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2005), where it was
                    opined that the “contemporary borderline between
                    fixtures and chattels may now be more case-specific and more
                    context-dependent than was once believed.” Thus,
                    “relatively few guidelines remain in the modern law
                    which are capable of unambiguous application to particular
                    facts.” Purpose, and not degree, of annexation is now
                    the primary consideration and “[i]nferences drawn
                    from the physical mode of annexation may well be overridden
                    by more subtle considerations relating to the objectively
                    understood motivation underlying the annexation in
                    question.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is clear that according
                    to the fixture test as described, the asset items in
                    question are undoubtedly part of land, being annexed to the
                    building that comprises Bugis Junction. The photographs of
                    the escalators, lifts, air conditioning and fire safety
                    systems adduced as evidence in this case show that these
                    have been built-in to or affixed to the
                        building.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    Accordingly, they therefore satisfy the first consideration
                    stated in <em>Holland v Hodgson</em>.
                    In regard to the object of annexation, there are no facts in
                    evidence to rebut the <em>prima
                        facie</em> inference to be drawn from the fact
                    that the asset items have been annexed to the building. I
                    note that there was not a great deal of difference between
                    the parties on the question of whether the asset items were
                    fixtures or chattels. On the present facts, neither common
                    law exceptions mentioned at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above applies. Given the nature of and
                    the manner in which the escalators, lifts, air conditioning
                    and fire safety systems are usually utilised, their function
                    or purpose is to be served by annexation to the building,
                    where they will remain in place for a substantial period of
                    time. It is quite clear that escalators, lifts, air
                    conditioning and fire safety systems are incapable of
                    utility on a free standing basis and cannot be enjoyed as
                    mere chattels. Air conditioners with vents, ducts and piping
                    form a cooling system that functions together to cool the
                    building in question. Escalators and lifts are mainly or
                    usually used for shoppers and visitors. In the case of the
                    fire safety system, it consists of several components. For
                    example, the indicator boards, piping, alarms, heat sensors,
                    hose reels, and sprinklers. All these components function
                    together to form the system. Each component also performs
                    its own discrete function independent of the others, but
                    taken as a whole, they are affixed to the building to serve
                    as protection from fire and are intended to remain in place
                    for a substantial period of time. As the Board found on the
                    facts in evidence, the asset items were fixtures and they
                    formed integral parts of the building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The alternative test is
                    the enhancement test. The Court of Appeal noted in <em>Pan-United</em> (at [48]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second test (“the enhancement test”)
                        is also embodied in the English case law –
                        notably, in the House of Lords decision of <em>London County Council v Wilkins</em>
                        [1957] AC 362 (“<em>Wilkins</em>”) and the English Court
                        of Appeal decision of <em>Field Place
                            Caravan Park Ltd v Harding</em> [1966] 2 QB
                        484 (“<em>Field Place Caravan
                            Park</em>”), as well as in the more
                        recent (also) English Court of Appeal decision of
                            <em>Rudd v Cinderella Rockerfellas
                            Ltd</em> [2003] 1 WLR 2423 (“<em>Rudd</em>”) (reference may
                        also be made to <em>Ryde on
                            Rating</em> (<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> <em>supra</em>) at pp 148 –
                        152). Briefly put, pursuant to the enhancement test, if
                        a <em>chattel is enjoyed with the land
                            and enhances its value</em>, it forms part of
                        the land for property tax purposes. More importantly,
                        however, for the purposes of the present appeal, the key
                        issue is whether the enhancement test is not (like the
                        fixture test) only embodied in the English law but is
                        also (and more importantly) considered, in the context
                        of <em>property tax</em>, as being
                        the operative test (the fixture test being consequently
                        held, in this last-mentioned regard, to be <em>irrelevant</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added by the Court of Appeal]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Phang JA cited the
                    judgment of Lord Denning MR in <em>Field
                        Place Caravan Park</em> as a succinct statement of
                    the enhancement test (at [49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever the cases may have said in the past, I think
                        that the law on this subject has been revolutionised or,
                        perhaps I ought to say, made clear, by the decision of
                        the House of Lords in <em>London County
                            Council v. Wilkins</em>. The House considered
                        at length whether a chattel which was placed on land
                        could be a rateable hereditament. The Lord Chancellor,
                        Lord Kilmuir, said: “In my view a chattel to be
                        rateable must be enjoyed with the land on which it
                        rests.” Lord Radcliffe said: “A structure
                        placed upon another person’s land can with it form
                        a rateable hereditament, even though the structure
                        remains in law a chattel and as such the property of the
                        person who placed it there.” Lord Oaksey
                        agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Albery [lead counsel for the appellants] urged us
                        to hold that Lord Radcliffe was wrong. I am not prepared
                        to do so. If I may respectfully say so, I think he was
                        right. The correct proposition today is that, although a
                        chattel is not a rateable hereditament by itself,
                        nevertheless it may become rateable together with land,
                        if it is placed on a piece of land and <em>enjoyed with it in such circumstances and
                            with such a degree of permanence that the chattel
                            with the land can together be regarded as one unit
                            of occupation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Lord Denning did not
                    mention the requirement that the value of the land be
                    enhanced. However, that requirement was present in the
                    judgment of Lord Kilmuir which he cited. The observations
                    relating to the fixture test apply equally here. The items
                    have been annexed to the building with a significant degree
                    of permanence. They are enjoyed with the building, and
                    indeed significantly influence the enjoyment and use of the
                    building, rather than being enjoyed as mere chattels. The
                    principle requirement of the enhancement test is that the
                    thing concerned must enhance the value of the land. In
                    context “value” here should be understood to
                    refer to how much a property is worth in the lay sense. For
                    example, a building with the asset items installed would be
                    worth more than one that is not is self-evident. The same
                    point is evident using the analogy of a sale of the property
                    with fixtures. In a sale of property, the transfer of the
                    real estate would include the fixtures and the transfer
                    instrument to be assessed for duty would include the
                    transferor’s title to or interest in the
                    fixtures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In my judgment, either
                    test should reach the conclusion that the asset items are
                    affixed to land so as to become part of the land and, thus,
                    be assessable to tax together with the building concerned
                    under s 6(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether depreciation of the asset items should be
                included</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Given the Board’s
                    finding that the asset items are fixtures that form part of
                    the building comprising the shopping centre known as Bugis
                    Junction, the asset items are, in my view, assessable to tax
                    together with immoveable property under s 6(1) of the PTA.
                    Put another way, as fixtures the asset items enhance the
                    value of the building, and they are, thus, included in the
                    assessment of the building’s annual value. It follows
                    that the portion of the gross rent for depreciation of the
                    asset items in question has to do with the letting of the
                    Premises, which, in turn, means that the depreciation
                    component in the gross rent is related to rent or letting of
                    the Premises. Therefore, the depreciation component in the
                    gross rent has to be included in the computation of annual
                    value in the valuation years of 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Given the analysis in
                        <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above, how is
                        <em>Chartered Bank</em> to be
                    explained?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     While the statute
                    applicable at the time was the Local Government Ordinance
                    1957, the provision regarding annual value there was
                        <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with the current version of the PTA.
                    The Chief Assessor argues that the decision in that case is
                    not binding as there is no <em>ratio
                        decidendi</em> applicable to the present case. In
                    that case, the learned judge had to decide on the quantum of
                    expenditure for lifts, air conditioners and fire
                    extinguishers to be deducted in arriving at the annual value
                    of the property, but he did not decide whether in principle
                    depreciation of equipment should be included or excluded.
                    The learned judge’s attention was directed towards
                    whether amortization or depreciation was the correct method
                    for ascertaining the cost of such equipment. While the Chief
                    Assessor’s contentions appear to be, strictly
                    speaking, correct, this seems a rather fine technical
                    argument. As the Board noted, there appeared to have been an
                    implicit awareness on the part of the learned judge that
                    depreciation ought to be excluded from the gross rent for
                    the purposes of calculating annual value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I have already explained
                    in <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above why the
                    Landlord’s contention that <em>Chartered Bank</em> has been made binding
                    authority by <em>BCH (No 2)</em> is
                    misplaced. While <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em> was mentioned in <em>BCH
                        (No 2)</em>, depreciation was not an issue before
                    the Court of Appeal. Reference to <em>Chartered Bank</em> was to show that previous
                    cases, of which <em>Chartered Bank</em>
                    was one, were consistent with its holding that the concept
                    and language of exclusion rather than deduction be used for
                    expenses not related to rent or letting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Landlord cited the
                    English case of <em>Caltex Trading and
                        Transport v Cane</em> (1962) 9 RRC 313
                    (“Caltex Trading”) as an example of
                    depreciation being excluded from annual value. Again the
                    legal basis for the court’s reasoning is not
                    discernable. If the legal principle in <em>Caltex Trading</em> is that in addition to the
                    cost of annual repairs, the landlord is allowed a further
                    sum to meet or provide for depreciation of lifts, central
                    heating and boiler house and ultimately their replacement
                    cost in the future, the short answer is that the property
                    tax regime here is different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     
          <em>Chartered Bank</em> might not be as unambiguous a
                    case as might at first appear. The learned judge allowed the
                    exclusion of expenses related to services from the gross
                    rent in calculating annual value. Such services were (a)
                    watchmen and cleaning; (b) lifts; (c) air conditioning; (d)
                    common parts, and (e) cost of supervision. In addition to
                    the cost of these services, an additional exclusion (f) was
                    allowed for the landlord’s profit on services.
                    However, a seventh exclusion (g) was allowed for the
                    depreciation of equipment (lifts, air conditioners and fire
                    extinguishers). The sum on which the allowance for the
                    landlord’s profit on services was calculated on only
                    the first five heads (a) to (e) which were for services but
                    not (g) which was a different genre. This is a positive
                    indication that lifts, air conditioners and fire
                    extinguishers were considered on a different footing from
                    services generally. Another indication was Wee J’s use
                    of the phrase “total cost of services, <em>etc</em>” at page 5 of the report
                    to refer to the seven heads collectively: “total cost
                    of services” ostensibly referred to only (a) to (f),
                    while the abbreviation “<em>etc</em>” referred to (g). These two
                    points suggest that it was through inadvertence that Wee J
                    later referred to all seven heads as simply “total
                    cost of services” when determining the total money
                    sum to be excluded. It would appear that this contributed to
                    the Landlord and the Board being led astray in the present
                    case. In any event, there is no trace of an identifiable
                    legal basis upon which depreciation for equipment installed
                    in the building was excluded from gross rent in computing
                    annual value for property tax purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The validity of the
                    distinction made in <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>
                    can withstand scrutiny in light of <em>BCH
                        (No 2)</em>. In assessing annual value the
                    touchstone is whether a component in the gross rent is
                    related to rent or letting. This is in turn determined by
                    whether the machinery or equipment to which a component in
                    the gross rent is directed is part of the property or not.
                    In relation to services identified as (a) to (e) and the
                    profits on services, item (f), the expenses were clearly for
                    services and had nothing to do with the subject property. If
                    the conclusion is that the equipment, <em>ie</em>, item (g), formed part of land
                    (admittedly it is a stretch to consider “fire
                    extinguishers” part of the property), the expense
                    ought to be related to rent or letting of the property and
                    included in annual value (see also <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> &amp; <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There is, however, one
                    further question still to be answered: To what extent does
                    depreciation described as the notional expense for the wear
                    and tear of the asset items relate to the qualifying words
                    in s 2(1) of the PTA for the purposes of ascertaining the
                    annual value of the subject property? This question arises
                    from the Landlord’s use of the term depreciation as a
                    notional expense. The term depreciation invites discussion
                    on whether depreciation as “notional expense”
                    or depreciation in the form of a notional provision for
                    future replacement cost of the asset items is within the
                    ambit of the qualifying words in s 2(1) of the
                PTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I start with the function
                    of the qualifying words. The tax base in relation to the
                    category of properties under s 2(1) of the PTA is the annual
                    value, which includes an amount which the landlord charges
                    the tenant to cover his responsibility for repairs and other
                    annual outgoings as described by the qualifying words. This
                    is clear from the various statements of principle made by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Hee
                        </em><em>Liang (CA)</em>. In
                    that case, Andrew Phang JA (delivering the judgment of the
                    court) reiterated (a) that the “very premise
                    underlying the ascertainment of annual value, <em>viz</em>, the relation to the rent or
                    letting of the subject property, which in turn approximates
                    the real value of the property” (at [40]), and (b) that the
                    function of the qualifying words in the definition of
                    “annual value” is that the annual value would
                        <em>include</em> the element of the
                    landlord’s expenses for repair, insurance, maintenance
                    or upkeep and all taxes except Goods and Services Tax (at
                        [43]). Phang JA
                    said (at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this respect, the function of the qualifying
                        words...in this category of properties [s 2(1)(<em>a</em>)] is to affix the
                        responsibility of paying all the expenses of property
                        tax, repair, maintenance and insurance <em>on the landlord</em>. Indeed, as the
                        Judge pointed out on the Judgment (at [8]), “[t]he
                        effect of that definition is that the landlord may be
                        assumed to include, within the rental charged to the
                        tenant, an amount to recoup his expenses of repair,
                        insurance, maintenance or upkeep of the premises
                        let.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added by the Court of Appeal]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Two consequences flow from
                    the meaning ascribed to the qualifying words: (a) the
                    landlord’s actual expenses have to be expended in the
                    year of valuation and (b) the expenses must relate to
                    repairs, insurance, maintenance or upkeep of the subject
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In contrast, conceptually
                    depreciation is not an expense in the true sense of the
                    word. The claim for depreciation of the asset items,
                    referred to as a notional expense, is in respect of any
                    contingent or future replacement cost of the asset items. It
                    seems to me that what is envisaged in the depreciation claim
                    is the Landlord notionally expending from year to year such
                    sum as will in the future replace the asset items at the end
                    of their useful life. Depreciation for escalators, lifts,
                    air conditioning and fire safety systems installed in Bugis
                    Junction were calculated by reference to the same
                    depreciation rate adopted in <em>Chartered
                        Bank</em>, and by attributing to those asset items
                    a depreciable notional useful life and calculating the
                    appropriate allowance to be made so that the relevant asset
                    item would be able to be replaced at the end of its notional
                    useful life. In assigning $0.20 per square foot per month to
                    the depreciation of the asset items, the Landlord appears to
                    be referring to either a notional provision or a notional
                    account of its replacement cost but given its
                    “notional” character, no eventuality to
                    replace need follow. In reality, no expenditure falling
                    within the qualifying words has occurred in the valuation
                    year. In the context of a sinking fund, such as that
                    discussed in <em>Tan Hee </em><em>Liang (CA)</em>, the money for major
                    maintenance and repairs comes from the sinking fund and will
                    be included in the assessment of the annual value for
                    purposes of property tax when the money is spent or
                    specifically allocated in the future. As to when money can
                    be considered to be specifically allocated is something
                    which Phang JA has called upon the Chief Assessor to provide
                    firm guidelines. In <em>Tan Hee
                        </em><em>Liang</em> the Chief
                    Assessor excluded from the gross rent contributions payable
                    towards the sinking fund in the computation of annual value
                    when no money from the sinking fund was spent towards major
                    repairs in the valuation year. Notably, contributions to a
                    sinking fund in the gross rent is conceptually different
                    from the depreciation component in the gross rent in respect
                    of the asset items. In the present case, the claim for
                    depreciation is a “notional expense” in
                    respect of contingent or future replacement cost of the
                    asset. By parity of reasoning (and not by analogy), Phang
                    JA’s observations are instructive to clarify that
                    landlords’ expenses within the meaning of the
                    qualifying words must be expended in the valuation year if
                    the expenditure is to be included in the annual value. Phang
                    JA said (at [73]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]here arises the issue of <em>when</em> the funds utilised from the sinking
                        fund for the purposes of maintenance and repair can be
                        included in the assessment of the annual value for the
                        purposes of property tax. We are of the view that such
                        inclusion can take place only <em>when
                            the maintenance and repairs are in fact effected or
                            at least specifically allocated (which would, in the
                            nature of things, be a major undertaking</em>
                        (see above at [55]). Thus, in so far as present
                        maintenance preserves the value and hence goes towards
                        the present value, this should be included. As for
                        future maintenance, we think this might enhance (or
                        preserve) the value of the property and hence is related
                        to the annual value. However, just when “specific
                        allocation” of funds for such future maintenance
                        takes place is something which we think the Chief
                        Assessor would be in a better position to provide some
                        firm guidelines on after consultation with the relevant
                        industry stakeholders. Apart from the precise timing
                        when the payments ought to be taken into account, there
                        is a further issue of whether one-off payments have a
                        permanent effect on the property tax payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added by the Court of Appeal]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In my judgment, a notional
                    expense is outside the ambit of the qualifying words in the
                    statutory definition of annual value. The sum of $0.20 per
                    square feet per month in the gross rent is a payment related
                    to rent or letting of the Premises for the reasons set out
                    in [43], and is,
                    therefore, included in the computation of annual value for
                    the valuation years of 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p>For the reasons stated, the Chief Assessor’s
                    appeal in OS 422/2011 is allowed with costs. Since the
                    parties have agreed to the annual values applicable if
                    depreciation of the asset items is to be included in the
                    computation of annual value, the figures in Column E of the
