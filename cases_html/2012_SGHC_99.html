<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an action by
                    Manickam Sankar (“the plaintiff”) against his
                    former employer, Selvaraj Madhavan (trading as MKN
                    Construction &amp; Engineering) (“Madhavan”),
                    as the first defendant and Trans Equatorial Engineering Pte
                    Ltd (“TEE”) as the second defendant. The
                    plaintiff instituted his action on 16 March 2011,
                    claiming that both defendants were liable for his fall from
                    the area between the false ceiling of the first storey and
                    the floor slab of the second storey of Terminal 1, Changi
                    Airport (“the Ceiling Space”) which caused him
                    to suffer various injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       TEE was the main contractor
                    in a project for the “Design, Supply, Installation,
                    Testing and Commissioning of VAV Boxes and Associated
                    Control and Electrical Works in T1 and T2, Singapore Changi
                    Airport” (“the Project”). The project
                    owner was the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore
                    (“CAAS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Madhavan failed to enter an
                    appearance although the writ of summons was served on him by
                    way of personal service on 19 March 2011. Consequently,
                    interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was entered
                    against him by the plaintiff on 29 March
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff’s action
                    against TEE was bifurcated on 29 June
                2011.</p>

                    witness called in support of his case. His account in his
                    Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of the
                    events leading up to the fall was as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    On the night of 19.05.2009, I
                            was working at Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 1.
                            As I did not know the way to Singapore Changi
                            Airport Terminal 1, I met one Kannan and followed
                            him. We reached the Singapore Changi Airport
                            Terminal 1 at or about 11.00pm. As work was to start
                            at 1.00am, Kannan and I went to a warehouse to pick
                            up some equipment (air-conditioner spare parts)
                            before going to Terminal 1. Upon reaching Terminal
                            1, as there was still time to spare, the other
                            workers and I were sitting around the bus terminal
                            and drinking coffee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    A group of 10 workers including
                            me were involved in carrying out the works at the
                            material time. Rex [a supervisor, one Selvaraj Arun
                            Johansonrex (“Rex”)] came to the spot
                            and told all the workers including me to be at the
                            work area by [11.50pm] as work had to start at
                            [midnight]. Accordingly all the other workers and I
                            walked to the work area. <em>At
                                [11.55pm] all the workers including myself were
                                given safety belts without any explanation. We
                                were not issued with other safety equipment like
                                safety helmets. Even the safety shoes I was
                                wearing on the day of the accident was my
                                own</em>. Thereafter, Rex told us to
                            follow Kannan and go up and start work. <em>Rex did not do or say anything else. We
                                did not have any safety briefing that
                                day</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    We were working on the staging
                            of the said premises which is about 12 metres high.
                            We were fixing the air-conditioner. As such, each of
                            the workers including myself had carried a ladder to
                            the work area. <em>Rex did not climb
                                the ladder.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    When I was mounting the ladder,
                            I had already worn my safety belt as I had already
                            commenced work. <em>The area was

                                catwalks and the false ceiling (“ceiling
                                panels”). </em></b><em>Further, approximately every 3 feet of the work
                                area was covered with huge railings. There was
                                no space for the other workers and myself to
                                walk and do our work. Thus, we had to crawl on
                                our bellies to move from one point to the other.

                                carried equipment and crawled to the other side
                                of the work area after Kannan. I was the next

                                turned around to crawl back to the other side of

<p class="Judg-1">When the plaintiff stated “On the night of
                    19.05.2009...” at para 4 of his AEIC, this was
                    clearly a mistake because the plaintiff reached Changi
                    Airport on the night of 18 May 2009 and the accident
                        (<em>ie</em>, the fall from the
                    Ceiling Space) occurred in the early hours of 19 May
                    2009. Nothing turned on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff’s
                    account in his AEIC of what happened was elaborated upon in
                    oral evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Before the plaintiff went up the ladder to the
                Ceiling Space</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff is an Indian
                    national. Before he arrived in Singapore sometime in March
                    or April 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, he was
                    working, and had always been working, as a marketing
                    executive in the finance sector in India<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.
                    This job did not require him to wear a safety
                        harness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime in March or April
                    2009, the plaintiff attended a “Construction Safety
                    Orientation Course for Workers (General Trade)” which
                    was conducted in Singapore by an entity called
                    “Armstrong Health and Safety Training
                    Providers” (see Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents
                    (“PB”) at p 50) (“the Safety
                        Course”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff was
                    taught how to wear a safety harness and how to hook the
                    safety harness to metal railings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. However, the
                    Safety Course did not teach him how to hook the safety
                    harness to objects which were larger than the opening of the
                        hook<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. I
                    demonstrated to the plaintiff how the safety harness could
                    be hooked to such objects by looping the rope around the
                    object and then attaching the hook to the rope itself
                    (“loop-hooking”). The plaintiff stated that he
                    was not taught this method of hooking the safety harness at
                    the Safety Course, and that he had not personally thought
                    about this method before<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore,
                    during the Safety Course he was only told that the safety
                    harness should be hooked when he was at the place where the
                    work proper was being carried out. He was not told that he
                    should also hook the harness when he was moving
                        around<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 18 May 2009,
                    Madhavan instructed the plaintiff to report for work at
                    Changi Airport for “air-con
                        renovation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The
                    plaintiff arrived at Changi Airport at about 11pm on
                    18 May 2009. At about 11.30pm, Rex told him and some
                    other workers to be at the work area by 11.50pm because work
                    would start at midnight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. When
                    the plaintiff reached the work area at Terminal 1, he saw
                    two Chinese men. No briefing was given by these two men to
                    the workers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The
                    ten workers, including the plaintiff, were told that the
                    works would commence at midnight and that they should wear
                    their safety harnesses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.
                    Further, they were told that it was getting late and that
                    they should commence work<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. Rex
                    fixed the safety harness to the plaintiff because the latter
                    did not know how to do so<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The safety harness which
                    TEE produced at trial was not of the same type as the safety
                    harness which was in fact provided to the plaintiff on
                    18 May 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. The
                    safety harness which was supplied to him had hooks with a
                    gap of about 4cm. This was significantly smaller than the
                    hooks of the safety harness which was produced in court
                    (which had a gap of about 7cm)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before the plaintiff went
                    up the ladder to the Ceiling Space, he was not shown any
                    diagrams or photos of the Ceiling Space or of the particular
                    area in the Ceiling Space where he would be working that
                        night<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. He
                    was also not told <em>how</em> to hook
                    the safety harness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. Rex told the
                    plaintiff to follow one Ramanujan Kamalakkannan
                    (“Kannan”). The plaintiff, Kannan and another
                    pair of workers then went up the ladder<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. Rex remained at the
                    foot of the ladder on the first storey and was supposed to
                    pass things to the workers, who would then bring the things
                    up to the Ceiling Space<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. When
                    cross-examined, the plaintiff maintained that Rex was not in
                    the Ceiling Space when the accident occurred because Rex was
                    on the ground level near the ladder<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events occurring in the Ceiling Space</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the top of the ladder,
                    the plaintiff and the other workers stepped onto a catwalk
                    (see, for example, p 54 Second Defendant’s Bundle of
                    Documents (“SDBD”))<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Each worker was
                    carrying a plank to be carried to the worksite. The workers
                    then walked along the catwalk to the area where some old VAV
                    boxes were located (see red arrows at SDBB p 41)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. However,
                    at some parts the workers had to stoop or crawl because
                    there were obstructions. The plaintiff was following
                    Kannan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There were fluorescent
                    tubes placed every 7 or 8 feet “within some
                    gaps” in the Ceiling Space (see, for example, p 54
                    SDBD). However, it was dark at the place where the plaintiff
                        fell<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. That
                    area was not bright and not clear, but the plaintiff could
                    see his own feet<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At this juncture, it is
                    necessary to set out the following diagram of the immediate
                    vicinity of where the fall occurred<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Once the workers
                    (including the plaintiff) reached A, they left the planks
                    there because there were some “stage works”

                    fluorescent light (chemically operated) in his hand, whereas
                    the plaintiff did not have a light<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. Kannan was
                    the first person to cross from A to B, and Kannan had told
                    the plaintiff to follow the route which he (Kannan) took.
                    However, Kannan did not tell the plaintiff of the location
                    of the ceiling panels and that he should not step on
                        them<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Once Kannan had reached B,
                    he stopped there and motioned for the three other workers

                    Kannan and the other two workers did not hook their safety
                    belts to any external objects when they were crossing from A
                    to B<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff was the
                    last to cross from A to B. He stated that he could not
                    recall how he got across from A to B, and that he may have
                    placed his foot on the area marked by dotted marks (see p 6

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I observed that the
                    plaintiff was fairly big-sized and tall. In his AEIC (at
                    para 9), he said that he was 6 feet tall and weighed about
                    106 kg at that time. Due to his size, manoeuvring in such a
                    confined space would not have been easy especially when he
                    had to bend down to clear the horizontal railing before he
                    could get back from B to A. From a stooping position, he
                    would have to extend his leg out to step on the Transverse
                    Grating (seen as dotted lines in the diagram above) to
                    support himself before climbing on top of the Air Con Duct
                    at C, which was at a higher level, in order to reach A. The
                    plaintiff’s fall had to be seen in that context
                    because the horizontal railing was in the way, which made it
                    rather difficult to cross over safely in my
                opinion.</p>

                    cross-examined on why his report of the accident to the

                    interpreted to the plaintiff in Tamil before he signed it.
                    The plaintiff explained that what he meant was that he had
                    fallen off <em>together with</em> the
                    safety harness. He asserted that he did not tell the
                    interpreter that the safety harness had given
                        way<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. The
                    plaintiff also stated that he did not know what the word
                    “staging” meant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     When asked whether the
                    safety harness was hooked by him to an anchor point during
                    the crossing over from B to A, the plaintiff responded by
                    saying that he had not hooked it because there was no place
                    to hook it to<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>.</p>

                    Chandrasekaran (“Chandra”), were not new
                    workers in that they had worked on the Project before.
                    However, it was the first day on the job for the other two
                    workers (one of whom was the plaintiff) and Rex was aware of
                        this<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff was paired up
                    with Kannan by Rex<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Rex did not show the
                    diagrams at pp 4 and 6 of his AEIC (see above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> for the diagram at p 6 of
                    his AEIC) to the plaintiff before the latter went up the
                    ladder even though he knew that the plaintiff was working at
                    that site for the first time and the other workers who had
                    worked on the Project before knew about the
                        diagrams<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.
                    TEE’s project engineer, Tommy Liaw Chee Wee
                    (“Liaw”), was the first person to go up the
                    ladder, followed by Rex, Kannan, and three other workers
                    (including the plaintiff)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. Liaw
                    and Rex did not carry anything up the ladder, while Kannan
                    and the three workers were carrying tools<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. The wooden planks were
                    already in the Ceiling Space because some work was done
                    there on the previous night<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After all the workers had
                    climbed up the ladder, Rex’s evidence was that he had
                    told the plaintiff that there were metal catwalks and metal
                    railings. Rex said that he had also shone his torchlight to
                    show the plaintiff where to go and where not to
                        go<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>.
                    Specifically, Rex asserted that he had shone his torchlight
                    on the ceiling panels and told the plaintiff that it was
                    dangerous if he went closer to the ceiling
                        panels<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. Rex
                    made the plaintiff and Kannan cross from A to B and he
                    crossed over last<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>.
                    Although Kannan had a headlight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>, he did not turn it
                        on<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. As
                    Rex was crossing from A to B, he hooked his safety harness
                        somewhere<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>. Once
                    the three of them were at B, Rex showed the plaintiff and
                    Kannan the location where they would be working that night.
                    Rex then crossed back from B to A, followed by
                        Kannan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>. When
                    Rex was past A and Kannan was at A, Kannan called out to Rex
                    to say that someone fell down, and Rex came running
                        over<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>. When
                    Rex saw that the plaintiff had fallen to the ground level,
                    he informed Liaw and all the works were stopped<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     When questioned by the
                    court, Rex explained that in order to cross from A to B, one
                    would first have to stand on top of the air-con duct marked
                    C (see bottom right section of photo 14 at p 47
                        SDBD)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>.
                    After that, one would have to hook the safety harness on the
                    beam (see square beam running diagonally downwards from
                    upper right to middle of photo 14). However, as the opening
                    of the hook was not large enough to fit around the beam
                    directly, the loop-hooking method would have to be
                        used<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. This method of
                    hooking the safety harness was demonstrated by Rex in court.
                    Once the harness was hooked to the beam, one would then have
                    to step down to the Transverse Grating which was
                    about 40cm wide (see lower centre section of
                    photo 14, and also the area demarcated by dotted lines
                    in the diagram at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                        above)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. The Transverse
                    Grating was about 73cm lower than the air-con
                        duct<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>. The
                    distance between the air-con duct and the catwalk at B
                        (<em>ie</em>, the length of the
                    Transverse Grating) was about 1.5m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. Rex explained that one
                    would then have to stoop underneath a horizontal metal
                    railing in order to step onto B<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. This railing was
                    higher than the catwalk at B by
                        about 1.38m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Rex also explained how one
                    would cross from B back to A. First, while standing on
                    the catwalk at B, one would have to hook on to the
                    horizontal metal railing first<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>.
                    Next, one would have to stoop under the horizontal metal
                    railing and step on the Transverse Grating (most likely with
                    the left foot) to hook the safety harness (using
                        loop-hooking<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>) to the roof
                    truss which was further away. Both hooks of the safety
                    harness would not be hooked at the same time to the same
                        spot<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>.
                    After hooking the harness to the beam while stooping under
                    the horizontal metal railing, one would have to detach the
                    other hook from the said railing (“sequential
                    hooking”). One would then step onto the air-con duct
                    which was higher than the platform by
                        about 73cm<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. Rex did not
                    explain to the plaintiff how to navigate the path back
                    from B to A<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>.
                    However, he maintained that the air-con duct was the only
                    obstacle there<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence of the safety supervisor, Heng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Heng Chin Aun
                    (“Heng”) is presently employed by TEE as a
                    safety supervisor. At the time when the accident occurred,
                    Heng had been employed by TEE for about 10 years and
                    was the safety supervisor for the Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Heng’s evidence was
                    that on 18 May 2009, the work day started at about
                    midnight with a toolbox meeting for all workers who were
                    scheduled to work that night<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span>. This toolbox meeting was
                    held on the ground floor. It was “to remind the
                    workers of the safety issues that they have to pay attention
                    to at work” as they would be working at a height of
                    about 8m from the ground<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>. The toolbox meeting was
                    conducted mainly by Liaw who did most of the talking. Heng
                    added his comments and observations where necessary. It was
                    emphasised to the workers as a group that they would be
                    working at a height and that they should put on their safety
                    harness and hook it at all times<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>. Among other
                    things, Heng made sure that all the workers were wearing
                    their safety harnesses, and he also told them that they
                    should hook the safety harness to a safe anchor
                        point<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span>. However, he did
                    not demonstrate how they should go about doing
                        this<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>.
                    Although Heng knew that the plaintiff was coming to work on
                    the Project for the first time, he did not explain the
                    safety issues to the plaintiff separately<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     After the toolbox meeting,
                    Heng checked to ensure that each worker had put on his
                    safety harness before climbing the ladder<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>. After the workers went
                    up the ladder to the Ceiling Space, Heng remained on the
                    ground floor with one Mohammad Mohsin Bashir Ahammad
                    (“Mohsin”). Mohsin helped Heng to cordon off
                    an area on the ground floor in order to avoid injury from
                    falling objects to persons who were passing by. After the
                    cordon was set up, Heng was supposed to go up to the Ceiling
                    Space to ensure that the workers complied with safe work
                    procedures, especially as regards the hooking of their
                    safety harnesses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>. When the plaintiff fell
                    from the Ceiling Space, Heng was still setting up the cordon
                    on the ground floor. Heng ran to the plaintiff’s
                    location to help him and Heng noticed that the plaintiff was
                    still wearing his safety harness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence of the project engineer, Liaw</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Liaw is presently employed
                    by Sembawang Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd as a
                    mechanical engineer<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>. At
                    the time of the accident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span>, Liaw was employed by TEE as
                    a project engineer. At about 11.50pm on 18 May
                    2009, a toolbox meeting was held. Liaw testified that he had
                    reminded a group of workers, including the plaintiff, of
                    safety issues<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span>. Although Liaw
                    was aware that the plaintiff was working at the site for the
                    first time, he did not explain the safety issues to the
                    plaintiff separately<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>.
                    Among other things, Liaw told the workers that they were
                    required to wear their safety harnesses and to hook the
                    harnesses while they were working<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>. However,
                    he did not demonstrate to the workers how they were supposed
                    to hook the harnesses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>. The
                    reason for the absence of any demonstration was because Liaw
                    assumed that all the workers knew how to use the
                        harness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span>. The
                    plaintiff had not come forward to ask how to use the
                        harness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>.</p>

                    up the ladder<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>. He
                    led the workers to the first work location which was about
                    6 metres from A (see the two VAV boxes coloured in red
                    and which were closest to A at p 39 of

                    Those two VAV boxes were scheduled to be replaced that
                    night. Liaw assigned two workers to remove the VAV boxes and
                    another two workers to assist them. When Liaw was still at
                    this location, he heard a loud shout and he was told that
                    someone had fallen through the ceiling panels. At that time,
                    the workers were just about to start work on the VAV boxes

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     After the accident, CAAS
                    asked TEE to halt the works and to brief it on how the
                    accident could have happened and whether even more safety
                    measures could be taken to ensure the safety of workers. In
                    order to prepare for the briefing, Liaw went up to the
                    working area on 2 June 2009 to take photographs of the
                    location where the accident occurred<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Counsel for TEE, Mr Tan
                    Joo Seng (“Mr Tan”), argued that TEE’s
                    version of events should be accepted in preference to that
                    of the plaintiff’s for two reasons. First, Rex was an
                    “independent” witness in that he was not an
                    employee of TEE and had never been in its employment. Thus,
                    he had nothing to gain or lose from the outcome of the case.
                    Mr Tan argued that the same could be said of Liaw. By
                    contrast, a lot was at stake for the plaintiff because
                    although he had initially applied for workmen’s
                    compensation with the Ministry of Manpower
                    (“MOM”), he later opted not to accept
                    MOM’s assessment of damages and instead to pursue his
                    rights under the common law. The plaintiff had every reason
                    and motivation to twist his evidence to advance his
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, the
                    plaintiff’s evidence was inherently implausible and
                    demonstrated a selective recollection of the facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was highly
                        implausible that the plaintiff was not taught how to
                        hook the safety harness at the Safety Course. A safety
                        harness was a crucial piece of equipment to be worn by
                        workers working at height. It was very unlikely that
                        workers were not taught how to secure the harness
                        properly during the Safety Course.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff said
                        that he did not know how he had managed to cross from A
                        to B. This selective amnesia was deliberate. The
                        plaintiff managed to cross over safely the first time
                        and did not want to show the court that it could be
                        done. It was inexplicable that he could recall in much
                        detail the events occurring before he crossed from A to
                        B (including the lighting) but not the actual crossing
                        itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     Liaw, Heng and Rex all testified that
                        there was a safety briefing and their evidence on this
                        was not challenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     Rex did enter the Ceiling
                        Space. Heng stated that all workers then entered the
                        Ceiling Space except for Mohsin and himself, who
                        remained on the ground to set up a cordon. This aspect
                        of Heng’s evidence was not challenged by the
                        plaintiff’s solicitors. Further, there was no
                        reason for Rex to remain on the ground
                    level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In response, counsel for
                    the plaintiff, Mr R Kalamohan
                    (“Mr Kalamohan”), advanced the following
                    arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     TEE’s case
                        was loaded with inconsistencies between their witnesses
                        as to what happened on the day of the accident,
                        especially between the testimony of Rex and Liaw.
                        Additionally, there were internal contradictions between
                        the AEIC and testimony of the same witnesses,
                        particularly Rex and Liaw.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was no evidence
                        produced to disprove the plaintiff’s evidence that
                        he was not taught loop-hooking and sequential hooking
                        during the Safety Course. Therefore, the court should
                        accept the plaintiff’s evidence to that effect.
                        TEE’s argument was purely
                    speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was understandable that the
                        plaintiff was not able to remember exactly how he
                        crossed from A to B given that almost three years had
                        elapsed between the accident and the time he testified
                        in court. Furthermore, he had spent very little time in
                        the Ceiling Space (which had poor lighting) and had only
                        crossed from A to B once. It was not fair for TEE to
                        regard the plaintiff’s inability to recollect how
                        he crossed from A to B and his ability to remember the
                        lighting conditions as selective amnesia because the
                        lighting would be the first thing that one would notice
                        upon entering the Ceiling Space.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Before the plaintiff went up the ladder to the
                Ceiling Space</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first area of dispute
                    between the parties was whether the plaintiff had been
                    taught at the Safety Course in March or April 2009 how to
                    hook the safety harness by loop-hooking and sequential
                    hooking. I accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that he
                    was not taught these methods of hooking the safety harness
                    at the Safety Course. He appeared to me to be an honest
                    witness who was trying his best to recall the events which
                    occurred about three years ago. It would have been highly
                    implausible if the plaintiff had not been taught how to hook
                    the safety harness <em>at all</em>.
                    However, as the plaintiff testified, he was in fact taught
                    how to wear the safety harness and how to hook the safety
                    harness to objects such as metal railings (where the objects
                    were smaller than the gap in the hook). Given that this was
                    so, I rejected Mr Tan’s submission that the additional
                    methods of loop-hooking and sequential hooking were also
                    taught during the Safety Course. It was open to TEE to have
                    called the course instructors to testify in court but it did
                    not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The second area of dispute
                    was whether a safety briefing had been conducted on the
                    night of 18 May 2009 and, if so, what matters were
                    touched upon during the briefing. Based on the evidence of
                    Liaw and Heng, I accepted that there had been a safety
                    briefing on that night and that the workers had been
                    reminded that they should wear their safety harnesses and
                    hook their safety harnesses to roof trusses, steel
                    structures or railings at all times. To a limited extent, I
                    was fortified in reaching this conclusion by reason of the
                    fact that the plaintiff testified that he had been told to
                    wear his safety harness (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Both parties did not
                    dispute the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff
                        had not been shown any diagrams or pictures of the
                        Ceiling Space before he went up the
                    ladder;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff was in fact wearing a
                        safety harness before he went up the ladder. The hook of
                        the safety harness which the plaintiff was wearing was
                        smaller than the hook of the safety harness which was
                        produced by TEE in court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff had not been
                        told by Liaw, Heng or Rex how to hook the safety harness
                        onto objects by way of loop-hooking or sequential
                        hooking; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff had been paired up with
                        Kannan who was a more experienced
                    worker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the circumstances, I accepted
                    these undisputed facts which were also established by the
                    evidence. I will now examine the events occurring in the
                    Ceiling Space.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events in the Ceiling Space</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The first area of dispute
                    was whether Rex had gone up the ladder together with the
                    plaintiff and Kannan. While the plaintiff insisted that Rex
                    had remained at the foot of the ladder in order to pass
                    things to the workers, Rex testified that he had climbed up
                    the ladder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I believed the
                    plaintiff’s evidence that Rex had remained at the foot
                    of the ladder to pass things to the workers. There were no
                    inconsistencies in the plaintiff’s evidence in this
                    regard. On the other hand, I agreed with Mr Kalamohan
                    that there were several inconsistencies which indicated that
                    Rex’s story was untrue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Rex stated in
                        his AEIC (at para 16) that he was the second person
                        to go up the ladder and he was followed by one Tong Jian
                        Wei (“Tong”). Tong was allegedly employed
                        by Yong Teng as Rex’s supervisor and did most of
                        the technical work to the VAV boxes. The other workers
                        (including Rex) were there only to assist Tong and
                        followed Tong’s instructions. However, Rex’s
                        oral testimony was that he was followed up the ladder by
                        Kannan and no mention was made of
                    Tong.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     Rex stated that Liaw did not stay in the vicinity
                        of A and went to another location outside the diagram at
                        exhibit “SAJ-3” of Rex’s
                            AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span>.
                        This was contradicted by Liaw’s testimony (see
                            <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     Rex stated in his AEIC (at
                        paras 25 and 26) that he had
                        “explained” to the plaintiff how to get
                        from A to B and that he crossed over to B after this
                        explanation, followed by the plaintiff and Kannan.
                        However, Rex stated during cross-examination that the
                        plaintiff and Kannan crossed from A to B first and that
                        he crossed over last<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     Rex stated in his
                        AEIC (at para 28) that he heard a shout just after
                        returning to A. However, he stated in court that he was
                        moving away from point A when Kannan informed him that
                        the plaintiff had fallen, and that he had not heard any
                        sound of the plaintiff falling<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_e"></a>(e)     Rex testified in
                        court that he had hooked his safety harness when he was
                        crossing from A to B and back from B to A. However, he
                        had not stated this fact anywhere in his AEIC. This was
                        a highly material fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In
                    particular, I was of the view that Rex’s failure to
                    mention Tong when he was questioned as to the identities of
                    the persons who went up the ladder into the Ceiling Space
                    was very significant. Rex affirmed his AEIC only about five
                    months before the trial (in September 2011). If Tong had
                    been Rex’s supervisor (from the same company, Yong
                    Teng) and had played such an important technical role in the
                    Project, Rex’s failure to mention him when testifying
                    in court was inexplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As for the question of
                    whether Heng’s evidence had any corroborative effect
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> Rex’s
                    evidence, Heng’s AEIC stated (at paras 12 and 13)
                    that “Nine workers would go up first with the Project
                    Engineer, Tommy” and that one worker, Mohsin,
                    remained below with Heng to set up the cordon. It could
                    possibly be inferred from the “Daily Toolbox Meeting
                    Form” (at p 8 of Heng’s AEIC) that Rex was
                    one of the nine workers who, according to Heng, went up the
                    ladder. I noted that Heng’s AEIC was less than
                    satisfactory because it did not expressly state that the
                    nine workers <em>did in fact</em> go up
                    the ladder. Nonetheless, even leaving aside this point, I
                    was of the view that Heng’s evidence had no
                    corroborative effect (and in fact undermined Rex’s
                    credibility and therefore the veracity of his evidence)
                    because it materially contradicted Rex’s oral
                    testimony that a total of <em>six</em>
                    persons went up the ladder. Therefore, Rex’s evidence
                    in this regard was not merely internally inconsistent (see
                    [39(a)] above) but also externally
                inconsistent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I was of the opinion that
                    it was not true that there was absolutely no reason for Rex
                    to have remained at the foot of the ladder. As the works for
                    the night had just begun, it was not unlikely that there
                    were things which had to be brought from below to the
                    Ceiling Space. In this regard, Rex’s explanation as to
                    the location of the wooden planks was highly
                        evasive<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The second area of dispute
                    was whether Rex had informed the plaintiff of the following
                    matters when they were both in the Ceiling Space before the
                    accident occurred:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     How to cross
                        safely from A to B and back from B to
                    A;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     The danger posed by the ceiling panels;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     The proper method of hooking the
                        safety harness to the roof trusses, steel structures or
                        railings (<em>ie</em>, loop-hooking
                        and sequential hooking).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I accepted the
                    plaintiff’s evidence that Rex had not informed him of
                    any of these matters. First, as I stated earlier, I accepted
                    the plaintiff’s evidence that Rex had not gone up the
                    ladder into the Ceiling Space before the accident. Secondly,
                    even if I was wrong on that point and Rex did in fact go
                    into the Ceiling Space together with the plaintiff before
                    the accident occurred, it did not <em>necessarily</em> follow that Rex had <em>additionally</em> informed the plaintiff
                    of those three matters. I was not convinced by Rex’s
                    evidence in this regard because there were numerous
                    inconsistencies between his AEIC and his testimony in court
                    (see <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above).
                    Furthermore, Rex was evasive when he was cross-examined on
                    whether he had shown the plaintiff where to hook his safety

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I also found it odd that
                    TEE produced in court a different safety hook that was much
                    larger instead of the smaller type of safety hook that was
                    actually supplied to the plaintiff at that time for his use.
                    In his examination-in-chief, the plaintiff denied that the
                    safety hook produced in court was of the same size as the
                    one which was supplied to him on 18 May 2009, which was
                    much smaller<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>. He was not
                    challenged on this point by Mr Tan. In my opinion,
                    TEE’s production of a larger hook was an attempt to
                    establish that the plaintiff could have used the larger hook
                    to secure the safety harness to an anchor point by simple
                    hooking. Before the trial, TEE probably had not thought of
                    the possibility of adapting the other equally effective
                    loop-hooking method to secure the safety harness equipped
                    with small hooks to the big roof trusses that were present
                    in the area where the plaintiff fell from. Hence, I was not
                    surprised that the plaintiff was not taught the alternative
                    method of loop-hooking with the smaller hook since TEE
                    apparently also never contemplated that possibility itself,
                    even up to the stage of the trial. If it had done so, then
                    there would have been no need to impress the court with a
                    different larger safety hook which the plaintiff flatly
                    denied was ever issued to him.</p>

                        Construction &amp; Engineering Co Ltd and other
                        appeals</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 746
                        (“<em>Awang bin
                    Dollah</em>”) at [20] for the proposition that if a main
                    contractor exercised or had the right to exercise control
                    over a workman (employed by its sub-contractor) in respect
                    of the work which he was engaged to perform, the main
                    contractor would owe the workman a duty of care <em>as if</em> it was the workman’s
                    employer. In this regard, Mr Kalamohan drew the
                    court’s attention to the following undisputed
                    facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     At the time of
                        the accident, the plaintiff was the direct employee of
                        Madhavan who had assigned him to work on the
                        Project;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     Liaw and Heng were direct employees
                        of TEE while Rex was the employee of Yong Teng
                        (TEE’s sub-sub-contractor).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On
                    TEE’s own case, Liaw and Heng had conducted a safety
                    briefing during which they reminded the workers of the need
                    to adhere to safety precautions. Heng had checked the safety
                    harness of all workers before they were allowed to enter the
                    Ceiling Space. Liaw went up the ladder into the Ceiling
                    Space first, and all other workers followed his lead. Thus,
                    on TEE’s own case it had control or the right to
                    exercise control over the plaintiff in respect of the work
                    he was engaged to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Kalamohan submitted
                    that TEE owed certain duties to the plaintiff, relying on
                        <em>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Parno</em>”) at [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The common law duty of employers vis-à-vis their
                        employees is clear. This was laid down in <em>Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd v
                            English</em> ... where the House of Lords held
                        that the obligation was three-fold – to provide a
                        competent staff of men; adequate material; and a proper
                        system and effective supervision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Kalamohan added that this categorisation was
                    not exhaustive and that there was also an established duty
                    on an employer to provide safe premises and access to it,
                    relying on <em>Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers
                        Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 786
                        (“<em>Dockers
                    Marine</em>”) at [22]. The plaintiff’s claim was that
                    TEE had (a) failed to provide him with a proper system of
                    work and effective supervision, and (b) failed to provide
                    him with a safe place of work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     With respect to the first
                    allegation, Mr Kalamohan submitted that even if the court
                    was inclined to believe TEE’s version of events, TEE
                    should still be held to have failed to provide the plaintiff
                    with a proper system of work and effective
                        supervision<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>. He drew the
                    court’s attention to the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     Liaw did not
                        state in his AEIC that he had instructed Rex to take the
                        plaintiff and Kannan from A to B. This meant that Rex
                        took the plaintiff and Kannan from A to B without
                        Liaw’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     No efforts were taken by
                        Liaw and Heng to explain the safety issues (such as how
                        to hook the safety harness in the Ceiling Space using
                        loop-hooking and sequential hooking) to the plaintiff
                        individually although they knew that he was a new
                        worker. Indeed, Liaw and Heng did not demonstrate how to
                        hook the safety harness to the workers as a group at
                        all. Liaw had assumed that all the workers knew how to
                        hook the harness properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     No diagrams or photos were
                        given to the plaintiff before he entered the Ceiling
                        Space. This was despite the obvious dangers and
                        difficulties which one would face in crossing from A to
                        B and back from B to A.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     No explanations were given
                        to the plaintiff on how to manoeuvre between A
                        and B. Rex had not explained to the plaintiff how
                        to hook his safety harness in the Ceiling Space (by way
                        of loop-hooking and sequential
                    hooking).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_e"></a>(e)     Rex and Kannan left the plaintiff at
                        B for him to move back to A on his own without any
                        supervision although it was his first day of work at the
                        site.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_f"></a>(f)     Heng was supposed to enter the
                        Ceiling Space after setting-up the cordon on the ground
                        level to ensure that the workers complied with safe work
                        procedures such as the proper hooking of their safety
                        harnesses. However, he did not enter the Ceiling Space
                        at the same time as the plaintiff and the other
                        workers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Kalamohan relied on
                        <em>Parno</em> (at [48]) for the proposition
                    that “the instruction of apprentices and
                    inexperienced workers” was within the category of a
                    proper system of work. Liaw and Heng testified that they
                    only <em>reminded</em> the workers as a
                    group of the safety issues that they had to bear in
                    mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     With respect to the second
                    allegation, <em>viz</em>, that TEE
                    failed to provide the plaintiff with a safe place of work,
                    Mr Kalamohan pointed to the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     Various
                        obstructions (<em>ie</em>, vertical
                        railings, horizontal railings and the air-con duct) were
                        present in the path which the plaintiff would have to
                        take to get from A to B and from B back
                        to A.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     A safety officer appointed by TEE to
                        review the working conditions and to provide
                        recommendations had stated the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_49-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       That
                            there was “restricted
                            workroom”;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_49-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       That
                            “certain areas may not have available/nearest
                            structure (roof beam or truss) for anchoring of
                            safety harness”;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_49-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       That there were
                            “existing services piping across
                            platform” creating a “hazard of
                            tripping &amp; falling”. The safety officer
                            had recommended that the “area of existing
                            services across working platform be made known to
                            all work personnel as far as practical possible
                            (layout plans, etc)”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_49-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       That
                            there was a “gap within platform”
                            creating a “hazard of tripping and
                            falling”, and that the brightness of the
                            lights was not sufficient;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was insufficient lighting
                        at A, B and C with the result that the
                        plaintiff could not differentiate between the catwalk
                        and the ceiling panels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Kalamohan summed up by
                    referring to the court’s observation in <em>Dockers Marine</em> (at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>) that “the common
                    law demands more of employers who require their employees to
                    work at heights as compared to employers who do not expose
                    their workers to similar dangers”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">TEE’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Tan submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s claim under this cause of action should be
                    dismissed for several reasons. First, TEE did not owe any
                    duty of care to the plaintiff because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was not the
                        plaintiff’s employer at the material time;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     The working conditions were not
                        inherently dangerous and it did not exercise a
                        significant degree of supervision and control over the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In relation to the point
                    that TEE was not the plaintiff’s employer, Mr Tan
                    did not take issue with the general proposition in <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above). However, he
                    submitted that there was no evidence that TEE had the
                    requisite control or the right to exercise control over the
                    plaintiff in respect of the work he was to perform. On the
                    contrary, the evidence showed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff
                        took instructions from and was supervised by Rex who was
                        Yong Teng’s employee, or Kannan who was
                        Madhavan’s employee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     TEE did not deal
                        with the plaintiff directly and left it to Yong Teng
                        because the plaintiff was provided by Yong Teng’s
                        sub-contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, Mr Tan
                    submitted that the plaintiff had not adduced any evidence
                    showing the degree of TEE’s control and supervision
                    over him. The plaintiff’s AEIC was silent on this
                    point and so were his pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In relation to the point
                    that the working conditions were not inherently dangerous
                    and TEE had not exercised a significant degree of
                    supervision and control over the plaintiff, Mr Tan
                    submitted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The working
                        conditions were not inherently dangerous because there
                        were catwalks for workers to walk on. The catwalks were
                        red in colour and were lit by fluorescent lights at
                        regular intervals. The mere fact that the plaintiff was
                        working at a height did not make the workplace
                        inherently dangerous: see <em>Mohd bin
                            Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd and another
                            appeal</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 223 at
                            [34].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     TEE had not taken it upon itself to
                        micromanage and coordinate Madhavan’s and the
                        plaintiff’s activities. The plaintiff took
                        instructions from and was supervised by Rex or
                        Kannan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Tan added that it was
                    Rex (or, according to the plaintiff, Kannan) who instructed
                    the plaintiff to use the route which ultimately led to the
                    accident. There was no evidence that TEE knew or approved of
                    this route.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Tan’s second
                    argument was that the plaintiff had not pleaded any specific
                    particulars or material facts in his Statement of Claim to
                    explain how TEE had breached its duty of care. Consequently,
                    he was not entitled to adduce any evidence in support of
                    this cause of action and his claim should be dismissed. In
                    support of this proposition, Mr Tan relied on <em>Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v
                        Intraco Ltd and others</em> [1992]
                    2 SLR(R) 382, <em>Multi-Pak
                        Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco
                        Ltd</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 220 and Jeffrey
                    Pinsler SC gen ed, <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at
                    pp 360–363.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Tan submitted that TEE
                    had not breached its duty of care to the plaintiff because
                    it had taken the following steps:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     Giving a safety
                        briefing to all workers before they commenced
                        work;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     Checking that all workers had put on
                        their safety harnesses before allowing them to go up the
                        ladder to the Ceiling Space;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     Reminding the
                        workers to hook up their harnesses to roof trusses,
                        steel structures or railings at the working area at all
                        times;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_d"></a>(d)     Instructing the workers to work in
                        pairs and pairing the plaintiff with Kannan, a more
                        experienced worker;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_e"></a>(e)     Limiting the number of VAV
                        boxes to be replaced each night;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_f"></a>(f)     Reminding the
                        workers to ensure that there was sufficient lighting;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_g"></a>(g)     Reminding the workers’
                        supervisors to keep a close watch to ensure that the
                        workers took adequate care when
                    working.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Tan submitted that the
                    standard of care to be applied was that which an ordinary
                    prudent employer would have taken in all the circumstances,
                    relying on <em>China Construction (South
                        Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd v Shao
                        </em><em>Hai</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 479. Further, he submitted that although
                    evidence of general practice might be of material
                    assistance, it was ultimately for the court to decide what
                    would be required to discharge the standard of reasonable
                    care having regard to the particular circumstances of a
                    case, relying on <em>Chong Yeo and Partners
                        and another v Guan Ming Hardware and Engineering Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 30. Mr Tan
                    observed that TEE should not be required to give
                    instructions to the plaintiff on every aspect of his work
                    and that the plaintiff was expected to be able to carry out
                    some work himself relying on his own experience and
                    judgment, especially for simple tasks, relying on <em>Chua Ah Beng v C &amp; P Holdings Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2001]
                1 SLR(R) 844.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I was of the view that the
                    plaintiff’s pleadings were not fatally defective.
                    Although I agreed with Mr Tan that para 11 of the
                    plaintiff’s Statement of Claim was not sufficiently
                    particularised, this was not prejudicial to TEE. It was well
                    aware of the case which the plaintiff was putting forward
                    and which it had to meet (see para 13 of the Defence).
                    Even if there was some prejudice to TEE due to the lack of
                    particulars in the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim,
                    this would have been cured by the particulars given in the
                    plaintiff’s Reply (see paras 5 to 11
                thereof).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I found that TEE owed a
                    duty of care to provide the plaintiff with (a) a proper
                    system of work and effective supervision, and (b) a
                    safe place of work. I agreed with Mr Kalamohan that TEE
                    exercised sufficient control over the plaintiff on the night
                    of 18 May 2009 such that it could be treated as his
                    employer. There was no doubt in my mind that if TEE had
                    wished that the plaintiff be deployed to replace other VAV
                    boxes (at a location other than B), Liaw (who was
                    TEE’s project engineer) would have directed Rex (who,
                    on TEE’s own case, was the plaintiff’s
                    supervisor) accordingly and Rex would have complied. TEE was
                    the main contractor for the Project and the plaintiff was
                    assigned by his employer, Madhavan, to work on the Project
                    that night. According to TEE’s own Defence (at
                    paras 2 to 5), Madhavan was contractually bound to
                    provide labour to dismantle and install the VAV boxes. While
                    it was true that, on the face of it, Madhavan was
                    contractually bound only to Yong Teng, the reality of the
                    situation was that if one went down the chain of the various
                    contracts, the true power over the deployment of labour for
                    the Project was concentrated in TEE’s hands. That
                    power would be exercised, in practice, through directions
                    given by Liaw and Heng (TEE’s safety supervisor), both
                    of whom were present on 18 May 2009 when the plaintiff
                    reported for work. According to Liaw’s own evidence
                    (at para 26 of his AEIC), he was the person who assigned
                    workers to work on particular VAV boxes. In the
                    circumstances, it would not make commercial and practical
                    sense to find that TEE did not have <em>de
                        facto</em> control over the work that the
                    plaintiff did on that night.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I agreed with Mr Tan that
                    the standard of care to be applied was that which an
                    ordinary prudent employer would have taken in all the
                    circumstances, that TEE should not be required to give
                    instructions to the plaintiff on every aspect of his work,
                    and that the plaintiff was expected to be able to carry out
                    some work himself relying on his own experience and
                    judgment, especially for simple tasks. However, I found that
                    on the facts TEE had breached its duty to provide the
                    plaintiff with (1) a proper system of work and
                    effective supervision, and (2) a safe place of
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With respect to (1), I
                    arrived at this finding for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     Although Liaw
                        and Heng had given a safety briefing to all workers
                        before they commenced work, this briefing did not
                        include an explanation or demonstration on how the
                        safety harnesses should be hooked using loop-hooking
                        together with sequential hooking having regard to the
                        fact that at the location where they had to do the
                        crossing from A to B and back again in order to perform
                        the work, there was no convenient anchor point to simply
                        hook on to with the safety hooks that were supplied.
                        Liaw simply assumed that all the workers knew what to
                        do, even though he was aware that the plaintiff would be
                        working in the Ceiling Space for the first time that
                        night. The importance of these methods of hooking the
                        safety harness was underscored in this case because the
                        accident would most likely have been prevented had the
                        plaintiff been taught these methods.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     Although Liaw and
                        Heng were aware that the plaintiff was a new worker,
                        they did not take any steps to ensure that the plaintiff
                        knew how to get across safely from A to B and then back
                        from B to A. They did not testify that either one of
                        them had instructed the plaintiff in this regard, or had
                        instructed Rex to guide the plaintiff. This aspect was
                        particularly important because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_60-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The
                            architecture of that area of the Ceiling Space made
                            it necessary for workers crossing from A to B or
                            from B to A to take a specific path which would
                            avoid the obstructions and the ceiling panels;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_60-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The methods for getting
                            across from A to B safely would be different from
                            those from B to A, given that the Transverse Grating
                            was lower than the air-con duct, a horizontal
                            railing was blocking entry to B while there was no
                            such railing blocking entry to the air-con duct, and
                            the safe anchor points for the safety harness would
                            be different.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     As Heng was the safety
                        supervisor on that night, he should not have remained at
                        the foot of the ladder to ensure that the cordon was set
                        up before he went up into the Ceiling Space. It was not
                        clear to me why he had to remain downstairs to oversee
                        what was a simple task as compared to the work which was
                        going to be carried out in the Ceiling Space, especially
                        considering the obstructions which were present there.
                        The cordon should have been set up first before the
                        workers went up the ladder. Alternatively, Heng should
                        have instructed one worker to set up the cordon and he
                        should have gone up himself into the Ceiling Space to
                        ensure that proper safety practices (such as the proper
                        hooking of safety harnesses to roof trusses and beams)
                        were complied with. Heng’s failure to do so was
                        compounded by the fact that he had not demonstrated to
                        the workers how to hook the safety harnesses properly
                        (using loop-hooking and sequential hooking) in an area
                        where anchor points for simply hooking the safety
                        harness were not readily available.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     Heng’s
                        presence in the Ceiling Space was particularly important
                        given the plaintiff’s testimony that Kannan and
                        the other two workers had not hooked their safety
                        harnesses while they were crossing from A to B. It was
                        open to TEE to apply for leave to call Kannan or the two
                        other workers to rebut this assertion of the
                        plaintiff’s. It did not do so. Heng’s
                        presence would have made it more likely that all the
                        workers would comply with their instructions to hook
                        their safety harnesses. I could not see how there could
                        be a proper system of work and effective supervision
                        when Heng, as the safety supervisor, was not present at
                        all in the Ceiling Space to supervise the work carried
                        out there.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     Although there was an obvious danger
                        posed by the presence of the ceiling panels, no diagrams
                        or pictures were shown to the plaintiff by Liaw and
                        Heng. Indeed, the plaintiff was not even told that there
                        were ceiling panels which he had to look out for. This
                        failure on TEE’s part was compounded by the
                        particular path which workers had to take when crossing
                        back from B to A.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_f"></a>(f)     There was no evidence that Kannan had
                        instructed the plaintiff as to the danger posed by the
                        ceiling panels, how he could cross from A to B and back
                        from B to A safely, and how he could hook his safety
                        harness properly in that area (using loop-hooking and
                        sequential hooking). There was also no evidence that
                        Liaw or Heng had instructed Kannan to inform the
                        plaintiff of these matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     With respect to (2), I
                    found that TEE had breached its duty to provide a safe place
                    of work for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     There were
                        numerous obstructions along the path which the workers
                        had to take to get around the Ceiling Space in order to
                        carry out their work. Some of the obstructions were
                        particularly difficult to manoeuvre around, such as
                        horizontal railings which could only be circumvented by
                        going under or over them. Although I accepted that TEE
                        had no control over the layout and design of the Ceiling
                        Space (which was, presumably, under the control of
                        CAAS), this was not a sufficient reason for finding that
                        TEE did not reasonably have to take any steps for the
                        safety of workers who were working on the Project. TEE
                        had to take the Ceiling Space as it found it, but its
                        safety measures also had to be adequately adapted to the
                        Ceiling Space.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     TEE had failed to ensure that the
                        plaintiff had been adequately instructed on how to hook
                        his safety harness (by loop-hooking and sequential
                        hooking) to the various objects contained in the Ceiling
                        Space, some of which were larger than the gap of the
                        hook (which was 4 cm). TEE had also failed to ensure
                        that the plaintiff had been adequately instructed on how
                        to hook his safety harness while crossing from A to B or
                        back from B to A. This specific area was particularly
                        difficult to navigate because, as Rex testified, it
                        required loop-hooking and sequential hooking, stooping
                        and stretching in order to cross safely (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was insufficient lighting in
                        the vicinity of A, B and C. Sufficient lighting would
                        help workers differentiate between catwalks and ceiling
                        panels. Although there were fluorescent tubes placed at
                        various points in the Ceiling Space, the photos clearly
                        showed that these were not sufficient to provide
                        adequate lighting for the areas in which work was to
                        take place and for the paths which the workers had to
                        take to get to those areas. Furthermore, the mere fact
                        that fluorescent tubes were provided would not be
                        sufficient in the absence of proper placement, given
                        that there were many obstructions and objects which
                        would cast shadows. TEE should have given the workers
                        helmets with attached lights for them to wear or
                        provided additional temporary lighting at the work
                        location and the areas around A, B and C in the Ceiling
                        Space.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Occupier’s liability</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Mr Kalamohan argued that
                    it is settled law that an employer who is an occupier of
                    premises where an accident has happened can be liable to his
                    employee in his capacity as an occupier, regardless of
                    whether the employer is also liable under the common law for
                    failing to take reasonable care of the employee’s
                    safety. He cited <em>Ma HongFei v U-Hin
                        Manufacturing Pte Ltd and another</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 336 (“<em>Ma
                        HongFei</em>”) as authority for this
                    proposition. He then cited <em>Sim Cheng Soon
                        v BT Engineering Pte Ltd and another</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 697 for the proposition that an occupier
                    would be liable to an invitee for injuries suffered by him
                    where:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a>(a)     The occupier
                        knew or ought to have known of the danger;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a>(b)     The danger was unusual to that class of plaintiff
                        having regard to the nature of the place and the
                        knowledge of the invitee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Applying
                    these propositions to the facts, Mr Kalamohan submitted
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     TEE was an
                        occupier of the premises at the time when the accident
                        occurred;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     As the main contractors who had
                        been carrying out work at the said premises before the
                        accident, TEE knew or ought to have known of the danger
                        posed by the various obstacles (<em>ie</em>, vertical pipes, horizontal railings
                        and air-con ducts) in the path which the plaintiff would
                        have to take from A to B and back from B to A;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_c"></a>(c)     This danger was unusual to the
                        plaintiff considering that he was a new worker and that
                        no diagrams or pictures of the work area were shown to
                        him before he climbed up the ladder into the Ceiling
                        Space.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Mr Tan submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s claim under this cause of action should be
                    dismissed for several reasons. First, the plaintiff had not
                    pleaded any specific particulars or material facts in his
                    Statement of Claim to explain how TEE had breached its duty
                    as an occupier. As a result, the plaintiff was not entitled
                    to adduce any evidence in support of this cause of action
                    and his claim should be dismissed. Mr Tan relied on
                    several authorities in support of this proposition (see
                        <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Secondly, and in any
                    event, Mr Tan submitted that TEE had not breached its
                    duty of care as occupier because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     The danger was
                        not unusual to the plaintiff having regard to the nature
                        of the place and the knowledge of the plaintiff. The
                        plaintiff was working in a space above the ceiling. He
                        should have known that parts of the
                        “floor” were actually ceiling panels and
                        that these panels would give way if he stepped on them.
                        Para 7 of his AEIC showed that he did in fact know
                        this. Further, the plaintiff would have been informed
                        about the ceiling panels by Rex or
                    Kannan;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     The danger was not unknown to the
                        plaintiff and its significance was appreciated by him.
                        The danger was highlighted to the plaintiff by Rex.
                        Further, it was very likely that Kannan had informed the
                        plaintiff of the danger posed by the ceiling
                        panels.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     TEE had taken reasonable care to
                        prevent any injury from the danger. The plaintiff had
                        been reminded to hook up his harness to roof trusses,
                        steel structures or railings at the working area at all
                        times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Mr Kalamohan’s reply
                    submissions were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff
                        was in the Ceiling Space for a very short time and the
                        area was not well-lit. TEE had never requested further
                        and better particulars even though it had the option to
                        do so. In the circumstances, the plaintiff had provided
                        the best particulars that he could.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     Given that TEE
                        knew that it was the plaintiff’s first day working
                        in the Ceiling Space, it was irresponsible for it to
                        have assumed that he should have known that the ceiling
                        panels would give way. Para 7 of the plaintiff’s
                        AEIC did not show that he was aware of the existence of
                        the ceiling panels and the danger posed by those panels.
                        The term “staging” was used in the
                        Statement of Claim because the plaintiff did not know
                        what he had stepped on. It was TEE who had used the
                        terms “ceiling panels” and
                        “catwalks” in its Defence. This led to the
                        plaintiff using the correct terms in his Reply and
                        AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     Rex’s testimony in court as to
                        whether he had told the plaintiff of the danger of
                        stepping on the ceiling panels contradicted what he said
                        in his AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_d"></a>(d)     It was not TEE’s pleaded case
                        that Kannan had informed the plaintiff about the ceiling
                        panels. In any event, it had not produced Kannan as a
                        witness to support this assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_e"></a>(e)     It was not
                        sufficient to discharge TEE’s duty of care for it
                        merely to remind the workers to hook their safety
                        harnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For the same reasons which
                    I have set out in relation to the claim in negligence (see
                        <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above), I was
                    of the view that the plaintiff’s pleadings were not
                    fatally defective in respect of the claim in
                    occupier’s liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I found that TEE had
                    breached its duty as occupier for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     The danger was
                        unusual to the plaintiff having regard to the nature of
                        the place and the knowledge of the plaintiff as invitee.
                        Although it was true that the plaintiff was working in a
                        space above the ceiling and he should have known that
                        parts of the “floor” were actually ceiling
                        panels, it was an entirely different matter to assert
                        that he should have known that these panels <em>would or were likely to give way</em>
                        if he stepped on them. Given that TEE knew that it was
                        the plaintiff’s first day working in the Ceiling
                        Space, it was irresponsible for it <em>to
                            assume</em> that he had such knowledge. At the
                        very least, Liaw or Heng should have reminded the
                        workers of this danger. There was no evidence to this
                        effect. As I accepted Mr Kalamohan’s argument
                        in relation to para 7 of the plaintiff’s
                        AEIC, Mr Tan’s point in this regard did not
                        assist TEE.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     The danger was unknown to the
                        plaintiff. He had not been shown any diagrams or
                        pictures of the Ceiling Space, let alone that of the
                        area around A, B and C. Although Liaw, Heng and Rex all
                        knew that the plaintiff was a new worker, they did not
                        ensure that he was aware of the danger posed by the
                        ceiling panels. Given that the nature of the pathway
                        between A to B meant that workers crossing that path
                        would have to come very close to stepping on the ceiling
                        panels, it was important that the plaintiff’s
                        attention be drawn to the ceiling panels. This failing
                        on TEE’s part was compounded by the fact that the
                        lighting in that area was poor. Even if I was wrong to
                        find that Rex had not gone up the ladder, Rex’s
                        evidence as to what he had told the plaintiff in the
                        Ceiling Space was riddled with inconsistencies. I
                        therefore did not believe that Rex had ensured that the
                        plaintiff was aware of the ceiling panels and of the
                        danger posed by them. As for Mr Tan’s
                        argument that it was very likely that Kannan had
                        informed the plaintiff of the danger posed by the
                        ceiling panels, this was merely speculative. TEE failed
                        to call Kannan as a witness to establish that
                        fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     Although the plaintiff had been
                        reminded to hook up his harness to roof trusses, steel
                        structures or railings at the working area at all times,
                        this was not sufficient to discharge TEE’s duty of
                        care in the specific circumstances of this case because
                        the plaintiff had not been instructed on how to hook his
                        safety harness properly in the area whilst moving around
                        and between the various points A, B and C (by
                        loop-hooking and sequential hooking). Workers working in
                        that area had to have such knowledge given the
                        obstructions that were present. It was negligent, to say
                        the least, for Liaw and Heng to have assumed that the
                        plaintiff knew how to hook his harness in that way given
                        that they knew he was a new worker. While it was true
                        that the plaintiff had attended the Safety Course, it
                        would not have been unduly onerous for Liaw and Heng to
                        have confirmed whether he indeed had such
                        knowledge.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Mr Tan argued that <em>Ma

                    action in relation to a breach of the Act, was incorrect and
                    should not be followed by this court. In support of this
                    argument, Mr Tan relied on Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee
                    Pey Woan, <em>The Law of Torts in
                        Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2011)

                    where the Court of Appeal considered the effect of s 60
                    of the Act, supported his argument that a breach of the Act
                    did not confer a right of action in civil

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In any event, Mr Tan

                    s 11 of the Act, Mr Tan accepted that TEE fell
                    within the definition of “occupier” in
                    s 4. However, he argued that TEE had taken all
                    reasonably practicable measures to ensure that the
                    plaintiff’s workplace was safe. It had:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     Held a toolbox
                        meeting with the workers every day to remind them of the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     Reminded the workers to hook up their

                        railings at the working area;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     Ensured that all
                        workers put on their safety harnesses before entering

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_d"></a>(d)     Provided additional lighting at the

                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_e"></a>(e)     Requested the workers’

                        took adequate care when carrying out their
                    works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In relation to the duty
                    imposed under s 12 of the Act on “every
                    employer”, Mr Tan submitted that TEE was not the
                    plaintiff’s “employer” as defined in
                    s 6 of the Act. Mr Tan submitted that TEE did not
                    have any contractual relationship with the plaintiff, and
                    the plaintiff was not placed at its disposal to do work for
                    it. Instead, the plaintiff was under the control and
                    supervision of Madhavan and/or Yong Teng.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Mr Kalamohan submitted
                    that <em>Ma HongFei</em> was good law
                    and should be followed by the court. He argued that the
                    court was merely stating that a plaintiff had to have
                        <em>locus standi</em> before he
                    could commence a civil action for breach of statutory duty
                    under the Act, and that the test of <em>locus
                        standi</em> was whether a plaintiff could show
                    that his injuries were <em>caused</em>
                    by the breach of the Act. The criticism in <em>Chan &amp; Lee</em> was misplaced because
                    it was premised on a misunderstanding of that
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In relation to s 11 of the
                    Act, Mr Kalamohan submitted that TEE had failed to take
                    all reasonably practicable measures to ensure that the
                    plaintiff’s workplace was safe:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     Regarding the
                        alleged toolbox meeting, it was not sufficient for TEE
                        simply to remind the workers of the safety issues. It
                        should have explained the safety issues in detail,
                        including how to manoeuvre around difficult, problematic
                        and risky areas such as between A and B, especially
                        because it knew that the plaintiff was a new
                        worker.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     Regarding the alleged reminder to
                        hook the safety harnesses, it was not sufficient to
                        remind the plaintiff to do so since he was a new worker.
                        TEE should have showed pictures or diagrams of the
                        workplace to the plaintiff before allowing him into the
                        Ceiling Space. Also, TEE should have demonstrated to the
                        plaintiff how to hook the harness (loop-hooking and
                        sequential hooking). It was fundamentally wrong to
                        assume that the plaintiff would have known how to
                        loop-hook and sequentially hook his safety
                        harness.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     Regarding the alleged checks to
                        ensure that all workers were wearing safety harnesses
                        before going up the ladder, this fell short of the
                        statutory duty to take all reasonably practicable
                        measures. It would be more reasonable for Heng to have
                        entered the Ceiling Space together with the workers.
                        Heng could then have instructed the plaintiff as to how
                        and where to hook the safety harness.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_d"></a>(d)     Regarding the
                        additional lighting at the area near the VAV boxes, it
                        was clear from the photos that the workplace was not
                        well lit, especially between A and B. TEE should have
                        provided additional lighting at all areas of the
                        workplace. At the very least, it should have provided
                        the workers with helmets with attached headlights. This
                        would have aided the plaintiff to see the ceiling panels
                        clearly.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_e"></a>(e)     Regarding the alleged request to the
                        workers’ supervisors to keep a close watch on
                        them, TEE should not delegate the duty to take all
                        reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the workers and
                        the workplace to other workers (<em>ie</em>, the supervisors). Even if this duty
                        was delegated, TEE was still vicariously liable for the
                        conduct of those to whom its responsibility was
                        delegated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In relation to s 12 of the
                    Act, Mr Kalamohan submitted that TEE was the
                    plaintiff’s “employer” under the Act and
                    therefore owed him a duty under s 12 to take all reasonably
                    practicable measures to ensure his safety at the workplace.
                    Mr Kalamohan relied on the following facts to support
                    this argument:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff
                        was at the workplace to do work for the business of TEE.
                        The plaintiff was a loaned employee, and, by virtue of
                        the contractual relationship between TEE, Sing Wah
                        (sub-contractor), Yong Teng (sub-sub-contractor) and
                        Madhavan (sub-sub-sub-contractor), TEE was the
                        plaintiff’s employer at the time of the
                        accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     On the day of the accident, the
                        plaintiff was under the control and supervision of TEE
                        and not Madhavan. The plaintiff was on the worksite at
                        TEE’s disposal to do work for them. It was TEE who
                        allegedly held a toolbox meeting, who asked the workers
                        to sign an undertaking (see p 29 of Liaw’s AEIC),
                        and who allegedly took it upon itself to ensure that all
                        workers were wearing safety harnesses before entering
                        the Ceiling Space.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Mr Kalamohan pointed out
                    that TEE had not pleaded in its Defence that Yong Teng was
                    the plaintiff’s employer and that Yong Teng should be
                    liable for his injuries. In any event, Mr Kalamohan
                    submitted that if the court found that the plaintiff was
                    under the control and supervision of Yong Teng and not TEE,
                    TEE should still be <em>vicariously</em> liable for Rex’s failure
                    to ensure the plaintiff’s safety.</p>

                            give rise to a common law duty of care founded on

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    We should highlight at the
                            outset that even if the Appellant's construction of
                            s 10(5) of the Act is correct, s 10(5) is,
                            strictly speaking, not determinative of the
                            Respondent's civil liability to the Appellant in an
                            action for negligence, for it is trite law that
                                <b><em>there is no common law tort

                                <em>ie</em>, the statutory
                            duty which a plaintiff alleges sounds in negligence
                            must have been previously held to give rise to a
                            common law duty of care, or must be so declared by
                            the court adjudicating the matter, applying the test

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    Even if the Appellant's
                            construction of s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act is correct, therefore,
                            the <em>mere existence</em> of
                            a statutory duty on the Respondent to supervise the
                            backfilling is not sufficient to establish an action
                            in negligence at common law by the
                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Nevertheless, if there is
                            indeed such a statutory duty on the Respondent under
                                s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of
                            the Act (as construed by the Appellant), and the
                            Respondent had breached such a duty, <b><em>another possible cause of action that

                            this alternative legal route does not appear to have
                            been adopted by the Appellant. Although s 10(5)
                            of the Act clearly imposes some sort of statutory
                            duty on site supervisors, the Act only states that
                            breach of that duty will give rise to <em>criminal</em> liability under
                            s 10(8) of the Act. As <b><em>the
                                Act is completely silent on whether breach of

                            for breach of statutory duty would, in the main,
                            have depended on the construction of the Act in
                            general and s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) in particular, in order to
                            ascertain whether the Legislature impliedly intended
                            to provide a right of civil action to enforce the
                            statutory duty (see the leading House of Lords
                            decision of <em>Cutler v Wandsworth
                                Stadium Ltd</em> [1949] AC 398

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, a distinction has to be drawn
                    between, on the one hand, determining whether a duty of care
                    is owed at common law, and, on the other hand, determining
                    whether the breach of a statutory duty <em>per se</em> gives rise to a right of civil
                    action. In the present case, Mr Kalamohan’s
                    arguments on the purported claim for “breach of
                    statutory duty” (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>–<a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above) were directed at the former
                    rather than the latter. Furthermore, Mr Kalamohan did
                    not advance any arguments on Parliamentary intention which,
                    as the Court of Appeal noted in <em>Animal
                        Concerns</em> (at [24]), is the primary determinant of whether
                    the breach of a statutory duty <em>per
                        se</em> gives rise to a right of civil action. As
                    I had already found that TEE owed a duty of care at common
                    law (in the torts of negligence and occupier’s
                    liability) to the plaintiff, and that this duty of care was
                    breached, it was not necessary for me to go on to consider
                    whether ss 11 and 12 of the Act were breached by reason
                    of the facts raised by Mr Kalamohan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I should add that if Mr
                    Kalamohan had argued that a breach of ss 11 and/or 12
                    of the Act <em>per se</em> gave rise to
                    a right of civil action, s 60(1)(<em>a</em>) indicates that Parliament did not intend
                    such a result (as the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Juay </em><em>Pah</em>
                    noted at [63]).
                    Mr Kalamohan’s reliance on <em>Ma
                        HongFei</em> was misplaced because it was a case
                    where the principal question was whether a duty of care was
                    owed at common law in the tort of occupier’s liability
                    (see [43]–[45] thereof). The court’s comments in
                        <em>Ma HongFei</em> on s 60 of
                    the Act must therefore be read in that
                context.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Negligence depends on a breach of duty, whereas
                            contributory negligence does not. Negligence is a

                            others. Contributory negligence is a man’s
                            carelessness in looking after his own safety. He is
                            guilty of contributory negligence if he ought
                            reasonably to have foreseen that, if he did not act

                            the problem of apportionment and in considering what
                            is just and equitable, must have regard to the

                            in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Tan submitted that the
                    plaintiff should be held to be contributorily negligent for
                    the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff
                        failed to hook up his safety harness when he was
                        crossing from B to A, even though he knew or should have
                        known that he was required to hook the safety harness at
                        all times.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff failed to retrace his
                        route on the way back from B to A.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff
                        failed to keep a proper look-out for the ceiling panels.
                        He could have seen the ceiling panels because the
                        lighting conditions were sufficient for him to see his
                        feet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Mr Kalamohan submitted
                    that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     With respect
                        to (a), TEE did not have any evidence to show that
                        the plaintiff was contributorily
                    negligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     With respect to (b), TEE had not
                        proved that the plaintiff was shown the safe and proper
                        route to cross from A to B, or from B to
                    A.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     With respect to (c), while crossing from A
                        to B the plaintiff had followed Kannan and had somehow
                        managed to cross safely. However, on the return from B
                        to A, the plaintiff was the first person to cross and he
                        fell through the ceiling panels on his first step. Just
                        because he could see his feet did not mean that he could
                        see the ceiling panels. Furthermore, the plaintiff had
                        no knowledge that the ceiling panels would give way if
                        he stepped on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     After considering the
                    evidence as a whole, I found that the plaintiff was
                    contributorily negligent to the extent of one third. In
                    reaching this conclusion, I took into account the following
                    factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was
                        undeniable that the plaintiff could have reasonably
                        taken more care for his own safety when he was crossing
                        from B to A. It could be said, for example, that the
                        plaintiff should have spoken up and asked Kannan or the
                        other two workers how he should hook his safety harness
                        to a safe anchor point in that area. The plaintiff
                        should not have taken the risk and proceeded with the
                        crossing from A to B and back again, when he did not
                        know how to secure his safety harness to the roof
                        trusses and steel structures due to the limited
                        knowledge he had. However, I was of the opinion that
                        this should not be counted as a very significant factor
                        against the plaintiff given that he was a new worker and
                        that neither Kannan nor the other two workers had hooked
                        their safety harnesses to any anchor points in that
                        area. Further, no steps were taken by Liaw or Heng to
                        ensure that all workers knew how to hook their safety
                        harnesses using loop-hooking or sequential hooking.
                        These were methods which were essential to safe work in
                        the Ceiling Space given the numerous obstructions and
                        the absence of anchor points for simple hooking in that
                        area. Heng, as the safety supervisor, was not even there
                        at the work area in the Ceiling Space to answer the
                        workers’ questions on safety, if any, and to
                        advise and supervise the workers
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_b"></a>(b)     The lighting conditions in the area
                        were poor, making it difficult for the plaintiff to
                        differentiate between the catwalk and the ceiling
                        panels.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff had been paired with
                        Kannan who was the more experienced worker. However, TEE
                        did not call Kannan as a witness to substantiate its
                        assertion that Kannan warned the plaintiff of the
                        various dangers and taught him how to hook his safety
                        harness and how to navigate from A to B and back from B
                        to A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contributory negligence of the first
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Mr Tan also submitted that
                    the court had the power to apportion liability between
                    Madhavan and TEE even though the former did not defend the
                    action and judgment in default of appearance had been
                    entered against him. Paras [30] and [31] of <em>Ng Kim Cheng v
                        Naigai Nitto Singapore Pte Ltd and another</em>
                    [1991] 1 SLR(R) 270 (“<em>Ng
                        Kim Cheng</em>”) were cited as authority
                    for this proposition. Mr Tan went on to argue that
                    Madhavan had breached his duty to take reasonable care for
                    the plaintiff’s safety and should therefore be held
                    100% liable to the latter, thereby implying that TEE should
                    not be held liable at all to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I was of the view that
                    this argument did not assist TEE. In <em>TV
                        Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi and another
                        appeal</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 543, the
                    Court of Appeal stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">155    The law as to the apportionment of damages between
                            joint tortfeasors is laid out in <em>Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd</em>

                            English Court of Appeal held at

                                the plaintiff and the defendant it is immaterial
                                that there are others whose acts also have been
                                a cause of the injury and it does not matter
                                whether those others have or have not a good
                                defence. These factors would be relevant in a
                                claim between tortfeasors for contribution, but
                                the plaintiff is not concerned with that; he can
                                obtain judgment for total compensation from
                                anyone whose act has been a cause of his

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">156    We also find it useful to refer to the case of

                                Prestressing Pte Ltd</em> [2001]
                            3 SLR(R) 1  , where the judge
                            held at [92]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... [The] defendants were each a proximate cause
                            of the injury inflicted on the plaintiff. Although
                            they were not acting in concert when the accident
                            happened, their contemporaneous acts of omission
                            caused the indivisible damage to the plaintiff. The
                            defendants left it to the others to take the
                            necessary precautions and, cumulatively, they did
                            nothing at all. Each turned a blind eye to safe
                            working practices and relied on the others. Their
                            faults and breaches indisputably overlapped such
                            that each of them must be held liable to the
                            plaintiff for the whole damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, TEE’s liability <em>to the plaintiff</em> for his injuries
                    caused by the accident was unaffected by the fact that
                    Madhavan was made 100% liable (by virtue of the
                    interlocutory judgment in default of appearance) <em>to the plaintiff</em> for those injuries.
                    The injuries suffered by the plaintiff were indivisible and
                    stemmed from a single event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     As for Mr Tan’s
                    argument that the court had the power to apportion liability
                    between Madhavan and TEE, this would only be relevant if TEE
                    had brought contribution proceedings against Madhavan under
                    ss 15 and 16 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43,
                    1999 Rev Ed). I would add that even if TEE had in fact
                    brought contribution proceedings against Madhavan by way of
                    a third party notice in this suit, this would not have
                    affected the extent of TEE’s liability <em>to the plaintiff</em> (see <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I did not think that
                        <em>Ng Kim Cheng</em> was of
                    assistance to TEE for three reasons. First, the
                    apportionment of liability between the first and second
                    defendants in that case was based on counsel’s
                    submission without any citation by counsel of any
                    authorities to the court on joint and several liability (see
                        [31] of
                        <em>Ng Kim Cheng</em>). The second
                    defendant had instructed its counsel not to defend the
                    claim; thus, there were no arguments in rebuttal of the
                    first defendant’s submission on apportionment. Second,
                    it was not clear from the judgment whether contribution
                    proceedings had been brought by the first defendant against
                    the second defendant. Third, it was not clear from the
                    judgment (at [30]–[31]) whether the apportionment of liability
                    was between only the first and second defendants (with their
                    individual liability to the plaintiff being unaffected), or
                    whether the court had in fact held that the plaintiff could
                    only recover 30% of his loss from the first defendant and
                    had to recover the remaining 70% of his loss from the second
                    defendant. The fact that the court referred (at [31]) to the apportionment
                    of liability “between the two defendants”
                    suggested that the court was not dealing with the
                    plaintiff’s entitlement to recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In any event, the issue of
                    Madhavan’s liability <em>vis-à-vis</em> TEE was not pleaded in the
                    Defence. Therefore, even if I was wrong to hold that
                    TEE’s liability to the plaintiff was unaffected by the
                    apportionment of liability between Madhavan and TEE (if
                    any), TEE could not rely on the fact that Madhavan was
                    adjudged 100% liable (by virtue of the interlocutory
                    judgment in default of appearance) to the plaintiff for
                    those injuries as a defence to the plaintiff’s claim.
                    In assessing the plaintiff’s contributory negligence,
                    I took into account all the plaintiff’s acts and
                    omissions that had contributed to the accident as a whole,
                    whether they were in relation to the breach of the duty of
                    care by TEE or Madhavan. Once the total damage less the
                    contributory negligence of the plaintiff as a whole has been
                    assessed, it is for the joint tortfeasors to sort out
                    between themselves their respective portions (if they so
                    wish), which would not be the concern of the plaintiff. The
                    plaintiff could still proceed against Madhavan for 100% of
                    his loss by virtue of the interlocutory judgment in default
                    of appearance. If Madhavan chose to contest the default
                    judgment on the merits, Madhavan would be able to argue,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that he should
                    only be liable for 66.67% of the plaintiff’s loss on
                    the basis of the latter’s contributory negligence
                    which I assessed at one third after taking into account all
                    the plaintiff’s acts and omissions that had
                    contributed to the accident as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     For the above reasons, I
                    found that TEE was liable to the plaintiff in negligence and
                    occupier’s liability. However, I also found that the
                    plaintiff was contributorily negligent to the extent of one
                    third of the losses sustained by him as a consequence of the
                    accident. I ordered the damages to be assessed by the
                    Registrar with costs of the assessment reserved to the
                    Registrar. After hearing the parties on costs, I ordered TEE
                    to bear 90% of the costs of the plaintiff up to the
                    completion of this trial.</p>
