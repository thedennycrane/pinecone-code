O 32 r 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) provides that “[t]he Court may set aside an order made ex parte”. I disagree with CSC’s submission that O 32 r 6 should be read restrictively and that non-parties to an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order may not apply to set aside the order. In my view, it would be unjust to deny a person the right to apply to set aside an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order <span class="font-italic">that affects him</span>, just because he was not a party to the proceedings in which the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order was made. CSC’s narrow interpretation of O 32 r 6 is also not supported by the authorities that I was referred to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 345 (“<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span>”), the court held that the party who obtained an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order could also apply to set it aside under O 32 r 6. In coming to this decision, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) observed (at [19]) that O 32 r 6 “does not limit the court’s power by reference to the identity of the party seeking to set aside the order”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In <span class="font-italic">Emjay Enterprises Pte Ltd v Thakral Brothers (Pte) Ltd and others </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 729 (“<span class="font-italic">Emjay</span>”), the defendant obtained an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>attachment order under the Debtors Act (Cap 73, 1985 Rev Ed) against its debtor, Shah Electronics. The plaintiff obtained judgment against Shah Electronics in separate proceedings and a WSS was issued on the same day that the attachment order was granted to the defendant. The plaintiff subsequently filed an originating summons seeking, among other things, an order setting aside the attachment order. The plaintiff was a stranger to the proceedings in which the attachment order was obtained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 One of the arguments made by the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Em</span><span class="font-italic">jay </span>was that the plaintiff had no <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to take out the application to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>attachment order as the Debtors Act contemplated an application by the debtor only. Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) rejected this argument and held (at [46]) that the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>because it was a competing creditor who had a “legitimate interest” to protect. Although <span class="font-italic">Emjay </span>did not concern O 32 r 6, in my view, it demonstrates the court’s general reluctance to deny a third party the right to challenge an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order if its interest has been affected by the order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1968-1970] SLR(R) 194 (“<span class="font-italic">Chung Khiaw </span><span class="font-italic">Bank</span>”), the respondent obtained an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order declaring itself a legal mortgagee over the debtor’s properties. The appellant was not a party to the proceedings in which the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order was obtained. The appellant applied to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order on the ground that it had obtained and registered an order attaching the debtor’s properties earlier. O LIII r 4(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1934 (“the 1934 Rules”) provided that “[a]ny order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>may be varied or set aside on application, <span class="font-italic">by any person affected by</span><span class="font-italic"> it</span>, to a judge, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as to the judge seem fit” [emphasis added]. As the appellant had acquired a right that ranked in priority to the respondent’s right, the Federal Court held (at [28]–[29]) that the appellant was (a) a person affected by the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order within the meaning of O LIII r 4(1) and (b) entitled <span class="font-italic">ex debito justitiae</span> to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 O LIII r 4(1) of the 1934 Rules is similar to O 32 r 6 except that O LIII r 4(1) was expressly limited to persons affected by the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order. On the face of it, O 32 r 6 is couched in broader language since it does not contain any such express limitation. On that basis, the argument that O 32 r 6 is available to non-parties would be even stronger. However, in my view, an applicant under O 32 r 6 must also show that he is affected by the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order. It cannot be right to allow a stranger who is not affected by the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order to set aside the order. Either way, <span class="font-italic">Chung Khiaw Bank </span>is direct authority against CSC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 CSC tried to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Chung Khiaw Bank </span>on the ground that the appellant was deemed to be an “affected person” under O LIII r 4(1) because it had acquired a right <span class="font-italic">before</span> the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order was made whereas in the present case, CLK’s WSS was issued <span class="font-italic">after</span> CSC’s WSS. In my view, this distinction is inconsequential. The question in <span class="font-italic">Chung Khiaw Bank </span><span class="font-italic">w</span>as whether the applicant was affected by the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order; that is also the question in the present case. It is clear that as a competing creditor, CLK is affected by the Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In conclusion, I am of the view that CLK has <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>under O 32 r 6 to make this present application. I must emphasise that this application to set aside the Order is not an appeal. In permitting <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>orders to be set aside, O 32 r 6 recognises that an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order is provisional in nature and is made upon hearing one party only: <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [19]–[20].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Order should be set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In making the Order, Edmund Leow JC decided that a joint tenant’s interest can be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. His Honour chose to depart from the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 1008 (“<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>”) which decided otherwise. Before I proceed to consider both decisions, it would be useful to first describe the nature of a joint tenant’s interest in land.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of a joint tenant’s interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In a joint tenancy, all the joint tenants together own the whole property. Joint tenants have rights between each other, but against the world they are seen as one owner. No one joint tenant holds any specific or distinct share of the property. The interest of each joint tenant is identical and lies in the whole of the property. The hallmark of a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. See <span class="font-italic">Goh Teh Lee v Lim Li Pheng Maria</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2010] 3 SLR 364 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Teh Lee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]; Tan Sook Yee, Tang Hang Wu &amp; Kelvin FK Low, <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Principles of Singapore Land Law</span>”) at para 9.5.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Because each joint tenant’s interest in the property is indistinguishable, joint tenants have to act jointly to effectively bind the estate which they hold jointly. Every joint tenant must partake in any dealings with the whole legal estate before such dealings may effectively bind the entire estate since the whole estate does not reside in a single joint tenant. Therefore, although a joint tenant is entitled to the whole of the interest in the property, he cannot sell the property without the agreement of all the joint tenants. See <span class="font-italic">Goh Teh Lee </span>at [17].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 However, a joint tenant can sever the joint tenancy and if he does so, a tenancy in common would be created. Severance can only take place during the joint tenant’s lifetime because of the right of survivorship. A tenant in common owns a specific but undivided share in the property which he can deal with and sell without the need for the agreement of his other co-owners. It is accepted that an interest held by a tenant in common can be seized under a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The mere registration of a WSS over land held under a joint tenancy does not sever the joint tenancy: <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span> at [18]; the GD at [9]; <span class="font-italic">Principles of Singapore Land Law</span> at para 9.43, also referred to at [18] of the GD.

Each joint tenant holds nothing by himself; he holds the whole estate together with the other joint tenants: Robert Megarry &amp; William Wade QC,<span class="font-italic"> The Law of Real Property </span>(Charles Harpum, Stuart Bridge &amp; Martin Dixon eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2012) at para 13-003. How does a WSS seize such an interest unless the issuance of the WSS itself amounts to a severance? However, it is well established that the issuance of a WSS does not sever the joint tenancy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The GD does not directly address this question. Leow JC’s conclusion was that a joint tenant’s interest can be attached under a WSS because the joint tenancy will be severed when the sheriff subsequently sells the land pursuant to the WSS (see [26] above). As stated earlier, Leow JC relied on the view expressed in Tan’s article (2000) at pp 56–57, which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The writ of seizure and sale gives the judgment creditor no interest in the land seized. It would be logical therefore, to conclude that there is no severance. But it does not follow from this that the interest, which a joint tenant does have in the land, cannot be seized. It is submitted that severance into undivided shares is not a prerequisite for the issuance of a writ of seizure and sale against a joint tenant’s interest. <span class="font-italic">He has an interest, which can be converted into an undivided share by alienation, and “for the purposes of alienation each is conceived as entitled to dispose of an aliquot share</span>”<span class="font-italic">.</span> The judgment creditor however does have to state clearly that he is only taking the interest to which the joint tenant is entitled. <span class="font-italic">Although a joint tenant does not have an undivided share, yet when the property is sold, the erstwhile joint tenants will be entitled to the proceeds equally</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>unless they were holding in trust for themselves as tenants in common in undivided and unequal shares …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The proposition in both the GD and the above passage is that although a joint tenant does not have an undivided share, his interest can be seized under a WSS because it will be converted into an undivided share when the joint tenancy is <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span><span class="font-italic">ly</span> severed. I respectfully disagree with this proposition for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, the proposition focuses not on what is being seized when the WSS is issued but on what can be seized <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> upon severance of the joint tenancy. However, upon severance, the joint tenancy ceases to exist as it would have been converted into a tenancy in common. What the WSS seizes when that happens is not the interest of a joint tenant but that of a tenant in common. In my view, the proposition implicitly acknowledges that there is nothing for the WSS to bite onto until the joint tenancy is converted into a tenancy in common. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, before the court makes an order for a WSS to be issued, it must be satisfied that the interest that is sought to be seized under the WSS is capable of being so seized. If it is not capable of being so seized, the court cannot make the order. It cannot be an answer to say that that interest will subsequently be converted into one which would be capable of being seized. In other words, if the nature of a joint tenant’s interest is such that it cannot be seized under a WSS, it cannot be an answer to say that upon a <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> severance, the joint tenant’s interest will be converted into that of a tenant in common which can be seized under a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Third, in any event, the proposition seems to be premised on an ability to sell the <span class="font-italic">property</span> following a seizure of the <span class="font-italic">debtor’s interest</span>. However, the seizure of the debtor’s interest does not allow the sheriff to sell the property in respect of which the debtor is a joint tenant. Seizure of a joint tenant’s interest under a WSS is not the same thing as a seizure of the property itself. Further, it is clear from the earlier discussions (at [21] above) that even assuming that a joint tenant’s interest can be taken in execution under a WSS, the sheriff cannot sell <span class="font-italic">the property</span> without the agreement of all the joint tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 A judgment creditor may take only property to which the judgment debtor is beneficially entitled: Tan’s article (2000) at p 54. This is logical and is also recognised in s 135(1) of the LTA, which provides that the “interest in registered land which may be sold in execution under a writ shall be the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor at the date of the registration of the writ”. The judgment creditor cannot have greater rights than what the judgment debtor has. Therefore, absent statutory powers, the sheriff cannot sell property held under a joint tenancy without the agreement of all the joint tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Leow JC expressed the view (at [22] of the GD) that “given that the sheriff may apply to the court for directions under O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the [ROC], it is recognised that a sale of the whole property may still be ordered, in spite of the objections of a co-owner of the property”. I respectfully disagree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Order 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the ROC provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sale of immovable property (O. 47, r. 5)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span> Sale of immovable property, or any interest therein, shall be subject to the following conditions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) the Sheriff may at any time apply to the Court for directions with respect to the immovable property or any interest therein seized under the order and may, or, if the Court so directs, must give notice of the application to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and any other party interested in the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my opinion, O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) does not allow the court to order a sale of the property against the wishes of the other joint tenants. It merely permits the sheriff to apply to the court for directions <span class="font-italic">in connection with the sale of </span><span class="font-italic">immovable property</span>. In other words, O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) comes into play only where the sheriff has the power to sell the property in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I also disagree with CSC’s submissions that either the judgment creditor or the sheriff can apply for sale of the property in lieu of partition. Section 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) read with para 2 of the First Schedule provides that the High Court shall have:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Power to partition land and to direct a sale instead of partition in any action for partition of land; and in any cause or matter relating to land, where it appears necessary or expedient, to order the land or any part of it to be sold, and to give all necessary and consequential directions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The history of this provision was comprehensively reviewed in <span class="font-italic">Abu Bakar v Jawahir</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 865 at [7]–[17]. It seems to me that the right to apply for partition and the right to apply for sale in lieu of partition are rights given to co-owners. The WSS does not make the judgment creditor a co-owner. Neither does registration of the WSS; the general property and interest in the property remains with the debtor until the execution sale takes place: <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Chia Kin Tuck </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 322 at [14].  In my view, neither the judgment creditor nor the sheriff is entitled to seek either partition of the property seized under a WSS or sale in lieu of partition. I find support for this view in the observation in Tan’s article (2000) at p 58 that a judgment creditor would have to persuade the judgment debtor to ask for a sale in lieu of partition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Leow JC also relied on the practice in other Commonwealth jurisdictions. However, as his Honour noted (at [15] of the GD), these cases proceeded on the <span class="font-italic">assum</span><span class="font-italic">ption</span> that a WSS can be executed against a joint tenant’s interest in land, without any discussion. These cases therefore do not assist in the analysis of the issues discussed above. I would add that in Canada, s 9 of the Execution Act (RSO 1990, c E24), which was first enacted in 1957, expressly permits the seizure and sale of property held in joint tenancy. The section reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sheriff may sell any lands of execution debtor</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9.</span> (1) The sheriff to whom a writ of execution against lands is delivered for execution may seize and sell thereunder the lands of the execution debtor, including any lands whereof any other person is seized or possessed in trust for the execution debtor and including any interest of the execution debtor in lands held in joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Previous Canadian cases had assumed that a joint tenant’s interest can be attached in execution. However, in 1953, the Ontario High Court in <span class="font-italic">Re Tully and Tully and Klotz</span> [1953] 4 DLR 798 cast doubt on this position when it decided, albeit without giving written reasons, that a joint tenant’s interest could not be attached in execution. There was thus at least some degree of uncertainty in Canada on this issue before the legislature intervened and enacted s 9 of the Execution Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on CSC’s WSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>has been understood to be the law in Singapore since 1998 and in my respectful view, it remains good law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Accordingly, I set aside the Order and CSC’s WSS which was issued pursuant to the Order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Status of CLK’s WSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 If follows from the above that CLK’s WSS was also ineffective in attaching the Debtor’s interest in the Property unless the joint tenancy had been severed before CLK’s WSS was issued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Under s 53(5) of the LTA, a joint tenant may “sever a joint tenancy … by an instrument of declaration in the approved form and by serving a copy of the instrument of declaration personally or by registered post on the other joint tenants”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Section 53(6) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Upon the registration of the instrument of declaration which has been duly served as required by subsection (5), the respective registered estates and interests in the registered land shall be held by the declarant as tenant-in-common with the remaining joint tenants, and the declarant shall be deemed to hold a share that is equal in proportion to each of the remaining joint tenants as if each and every one of them had held the registered land as tenants-in-common in equal shares prior to the severance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Lim had served his instrument of declaration by way of advertisement (see [6] above) but had not registered it as required under the LTA.

In November 1994, M signed a declaration under s 53(5) of the LTA, declaring her intention to sever the joint tenancy and hold the property as tenant in common with Priscillia. The instrument of declaration was served on Priscillia but it was not registered. M left her entire estate to Angela. After her death, Angela lodged a caveat claiming an interest as beneficial owner as tenant in common of an undivided half share in the house. Priscillia contested the caveat on the ground that the severance was not effective and the entire property had devolved to her under the rule of survivorship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Court of Appeal noted (at [24]) that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the purpose of sub-ss (5) and (6) of s 53 of the LTA was to enable a joint tenant to sever the joint tenancy without obtaining the consent of the other joint tenants; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) registration of the instrument of declaration required the duplicate certificate of title to be produced and a joint tenant will not be able to sever his tenancy if the duplicate certificate of title is in the hands of another joint tenant or other person (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a mortgagee) who refuses to release it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Court of Appeal then held that signing and serving the instrument of declaration under s 53(5) of the LTA is effective to sever the joint tenancy “as between the joint tenants”; however, until registration is completed, the severance does not affect third parties (at [17] and [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The difficulties with the distinction drawn in <span class="font-italic">Diaz</span> have been commented upon: see Barry C Crown, “Severance of a Joint Tenancy” [1998] Sing JLS 166 (“Crown’s article (1998)”) and Barry C Crown, “Developments in the Law of Co-Ownership” [2003] Sing JLS 116 (“Crown’s article (2003)”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In 2001, the LTA was amended and, among other things, s 53(8) was enacted.

In any event, the law in Singapore has been clearly settled by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span>. In that case, the Court of Appeal held (at [14]) that “it is not the law in Singapore that a unilateral declaration of intention to sever a joint tenancy, when communicated to the other joint tenant, has the effect of severing it into a tenancy in common”. Although s 53 of the LTA was subsequently enacted in 1993 to give joint tenants the right to unilaterally sever a joint tenancy, <span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span> represents the law in Singapore where the requirements of s 53 of the LTA are not met. As discussed earlier (see [47] above), the requirements of s 53 were not met in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on CLK’s WSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Accordingly, CLK’s WSS was also ineffective in attaching the Debtor’s interest in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The writs of seizure and sale obtained by both CLK and CSC are ineffective to attach the Debtor’s interest as a joint tenant in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, the sum of $623,341.50 forms part of the Debtor’s estate in bankruptcy and is to be paid to the trustee in bankruptcy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As Leow JC noted at [23] of the GD, it may be unfair to a judgment creditor that he cannot enforce his judgment against a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property.

In my view, legislative intervention is necessary if this is to be changed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As CLK has succeeded in setting aside the Order and CSC’s WSS, I award him costs fixed at $15,000 plus disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Wai Kit Darren Dominic and Hirono Eddy (Characterist LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Chia Soo Michael and Hany Soh Hui Bin (MSC Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
