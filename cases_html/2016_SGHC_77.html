</div>
</div> At all material times, the defendant was a director and the sole shareholder of MCPL. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The key events</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Sometime in or around 2009, the defendant embarked on plans to list MCPL on Catalist (“the Listing Exercise”). He approached Ang Boo Hock Stephen (“Stephen”), a business consultant specialising in assisting and facilitating the listing of companies, to advise MCPL on its proposed listing. Apart from Stephen, the following professionals were engaged to assist in the Listing Exercise:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Paul Wan &amp; Co as the Reporting Accountant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) KhattarWong LLP (“KhattarWong”) and subsequently Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP as the solicitors advising on the Listing Exercise; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Prime Partners Corporate Finance Pte Ltd (“Prime Partners”) as the Sponsor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 17 December 2009, Stephen introduced the defendant to Eric. On various other occasions in December 2009, the defendant, Stephen and Eric met to discuss the defendant’s business plans. These discussions culminated in the execution of a series of transactions. Derek was present during some of these discussions. The genuineness of these transactions lies at the heart of the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Body Show</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The first transaction involved an asset belonging to the Mactus Group: the exhibits of the Body Show (“the Show Assets”). The Body Show was an exhibition showcasing actual preserved human bodies which were dissected to display bodily systems. The defendant was looking to sell the Show Assets and lease the same back. This arrangement was calculated to enhance MCPL’s listing prospects by improving the cash position of the Mactus Group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 It was subsequently decided between the parties that the Mactus Group would enter into agreements for the sale of the Show Assets to TIPL, which would lease the same to an entity within the Mactus Group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Sometime after 21 December 2009, TIPL and Mactus Leisure entered into a sale and purchase agreement (“the TIPL-Mactus SPA”) wherein TIPL bought the Show Assets from Mactus Leisure for S$2.8m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Under cl 3.1 of the TIPL-Mactus SPA, TIPL granted Mactus Leisure the right of first refusal to purchase the Show Assets if TIPL wanted to sell the same. TIPL paid Mactus Leisure S$1.7m for the Show Assets in the following instalments (leaving a balance of S$1.1m unpaid):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) S$400,000 by way of a cashier’s order dated 24 March 2010;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) S$400,000 by way of a cashier’s order dated 30 March 2010; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) S$900,000 by way of a cashier’s order dated 4 June 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Sometime after 12 May 2010, TIPL and Mactus Leisure entered into a lease agreement wherein TIPL leased the rights for the Show Assets to MPL for the sum of S$300,000 (being S$150,000 each for the exhibition in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively) (“the Lease Agreement”). The payment was made in the following instalments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) S$60,000 by way of a cheque dated 14 May 2010;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) S$180,000 by way of a cheque dated 8 June 2010; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) S$60,000 by way of a cheque dated 10 June 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Subsequently, TIPL decided to sell the Show Assets. Mactus Leisure declined to exercise its right of first refusal and TIPL proceeded to sell the Show Assets to ARG International Ltd (“ARG”). It is apposite at this juncture to briefly describe the relationship between ARG and the parties in this dispute. In 2004 or 2005, Eric, Derek and one Anatoly Karmazin (“Anatoly”) came together to form ARG. Eric and Derek each held 20% of the shares in ARG whereas Anatoly held the remaining 60% of the shares in ARG.

The sale was structured such that ARG would pay S$1.6m to TIPL and the balance of S$1.1m to Mactus Leisure directly. A total of S$2m was paid by PPS on behalf of ARG. Of the S$2m, S$1.6m was paid to TIPL and S$400,000 was paid to Mactus Leisure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Sometime in 2011, the parties decided to enter into agreements to reflect: (a) a sale of the Show Assets from Mactus Leisure to Carrindon Inc (an offshore company linked to the defendant); and (b) a sale of the same assets from Carrindon to ARG (“the Carrindon Agreements”).

The CLAs may be broadly divided into two categories: first, those between TIPL and the defendant; and second, those between PPS and the defendant. It would suffice for now to note that the defendant’s case is that the entire series of CLAs that were executed between the parties were sham agreements that were designed to mislead third parties in connection with the hoped-for listing exercise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 4 June 2010, TIPL and the defendant executed a convertible loan agreement wherein TIPL agreed to extend to the defendant the Tronic Principal Convertible Loan, being the sum of S$1m (“Tronic CLA”).

</div> PPS SA also corrected what was described by the plaintiffs as an error in the earlier PPS CLA. According to Eric, the understanding of the parties when PPS CLA was executed was that if the listing did not take place by 31 December 2010, the defendant would be obliged to return: (a) TIPL, the Tronic Principal Convertible Loan and Tronic Compensation Sum B; and (b) PPS, the PPS Principal Convertible Loan and PPS Compensation Sum B. However, the CLAs stated that only the compensation sums would be returned if the listing did not take place by 31 December 2010 (as noted at [19] above). To correct the alleged error, the terms of the PPS SA provided <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that the defendant was to repay the PPS Principal Convertible Loan, the PPS Compensation Sum B plus a further compensation sum of S$25,000 (“PPS Compensation Sum C”) in the event that the listing did not take place by 30 June 2011.

</div> Instead, he rests his defence on the following grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The CLAs are fictitious agreements.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The loan monies under the CLAs have been repaid.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In any case, the compensation sums provided in the CLAs are unenforceable because they amount to penalties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I note preliminarily that the defendant alleges that the plaintiffs were part of a larger “Tronic Group”. However, the plaintiffs dispute the existence of the “Tronic Group” as alleged by the defendant. I will return to this point at the appropriate juncture. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fictitious agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The central plank of the defendant’s narrative is that the CLAs were executed to create the false impression that monies disbursed to the defendant as loans remained unpaid, thereby entitling TIPL and PPS to convert the loans into equity at listing. The shares were meant to reward TIPL and PPS for their assistance in the following matters in the Listing Exercise:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Mactus Group would enter into a sale-and-leaseback agreement with the Tronic Group wherein Mactus Leisure would sell the Show Assets to TIPL which would then lease the Show Assets to MPL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Tronic Group would arrange for further investment into the Mactus Group prior to the listing of MCPL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Tronic Group would provide assistance in the form of securing underwriters, lead managers, placement agents and other advisors for the proposed listing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Tronic Group would source for potential subscribers for the proposed listed shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Tronic Group would provide strategic advice on the restructuring of Mactus Group’s business and capital structure to make it more attractive for listing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Under this plan, the “reward” was to be effected in the following manner. The parties were to enter into a series of convertible loan agreements to give the impression that monies were loaned to the defendant for the purpose of the listing and that the loans would remain unpaid. Monies were to be advanced by the plaintiffs and the loans under the CLAs were to be repaid  immediately after they were disbursed, with the repayment not being recorded and/or reflected in the books and records of TIPL and PPS, thereby giving the impression on the books that the loans could be converted into equity upon the successful listing of MCPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  The “equity” was fixed at S$3m worth of shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, double the amount that was purportedly loaned). The defendant agreed to do all that was necessary to assure the auditors and/or investors of TIPL and PPS that the loans were indeed outstanding and would be repaid even though the said loans had effectively been repaid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, since the sale and leaseback agreement involving the Show Assets was a part of the overall arrangement put in place between the parties, the defendant claims that the circumstances surrounding the Body Show transactions were inextricably linked to the execution of the CLAs and have to be considered when determining the underlying nature and purpose of the CLAs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged repayments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The defendant claims that the loan of S$1m under the Tronic CLA was repaid in the following manner:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mode of payment</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">10 June 2010</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">S$300,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Cash</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">14 June 2010</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">S$300,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Cash</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">22 June 2010</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">S$300,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Cash</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">7 September 2011</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">S$100,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Cheque</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendant claims that the loan of S$500,000 under the PPS CLA was repaid in the following manner:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mode of payment</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">23 August 2010</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">S$400,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Cash</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">- </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">S$100,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Set-off against the sum due and owing by ARG to Carrindon</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The defendant also claims that the additional loan of S$100,000 disbursed by PPS under PPS 2SA was repaid by the defendant by way of cash handed to Eric on 8 June 2011.

To this end, the defendant argues that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the imposition of the compensation sums is arbitrary and therefore unenforceable;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the additional sums are extravagant compared to the losses made by the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the plaintiffs were in a dominant position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the defendant and were more involved in determining and formulating the terms of the terms of the CLAs; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the additional sums are not commercially justifiable because their dominant purpose was to deter the defendant from breaching his obligation to procure MCPL’s listing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiffs’ claim is S$2.2m in aggregate, and comprises  two components:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Tronic’s claim for S$1,375,000 – the loan under  the Tronic CLA (as amended by the supplemental agreements) as well as a further sum of S$125,000 as compensation pursuant to the terms of Tronic 2SA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) PPS’ claim for S$825,000 – the loan under the PPS CLA (as amended by the supplemental agreements) as well as a further sum of S$75,000 as compensation pursuant to the terms of PPS 3SA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fictitious agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiffs’ case is relatively straightforward.

</div> The initial proposal was for TIPL to inject S$1m of funds by acquiring the defendant’s shares in MCPL. However, Eric did not agree to the proposal because MCPL’s audited accounts were unavailable then and he could not ascertain its financial position. Further, if the listing failed, the shareholding in MCPL would most likely be illiquid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The parties eventually decided to proceed by way of a convertible loan agreement under which the plaintiffs would extend loans to the defendant in his personal capacity. In return, the plaintiffs would be entitled to receive shares in MCPL worth two times the loan amount just before MCPL was about to be listed.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Penalties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The plaintiffs contend that the compensation sums were genuine pre-estimates of loss and thus do not amount to penalty clauses. To this end, they point to the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was every reason to believe that the defendant sought legal advice before he signed Tronic 2SA and PPS 3SA;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant conceded that he “d[id] have some choice” but chose to sign Tronic 2SA and PPS 3SA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The compensation sums were to compensate the plaintiffs for the repeated delays in the listing of MCPL.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues raised</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I shall address the issues raised in this order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there is a “Tronic Group” as alleged;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the CLAs were fictitious loan agreements;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the loan monies were repaid; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the compensation (or further) sums stipulated in Tronic 2SA and PPS 3SA constitute penalties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Burden and standard of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Given the considerable dispute between the parties over the true nature of the agreements and the events which took place, a brief review of the burden and standard of proof will be helpful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It is hornbook law that the court’s decision in every case will depend on whether the party concerned has satisfied the particular burden of proof imposed on him. As explained by V K Rajah JA (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East</span><span class="font-italic">, Ltd </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 (“<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>”) at [58], there are two kinds of burden in relation to the adduction of evidence. The first is the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden of proof which describes the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute exists. This <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden always rests with the plaintiffs, unless a legal presumption operates. The second is the <span class="font-italic">evidential </span>burden to produce evidence since, whenever it operates, the failure to adduce some evidence will mean a failure to engage the question of the existence of a particular fact or to keep this question alive. This <span class="font-italic">evidential</span> burden can and will shift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It also well-established that he who asserts must prove. The legal burden of proof is placed on the party who asserts the existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact: <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (Trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorol</span><span class="font-italic">a Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 63 (“<span class="font-italic">Rabobank</span>”) at [30]. In civil trials, the pleadings are central in determining the burden of proof because they state the material facts establishing the legal elements of a claim or defence. For example, the legal burden of proving a pleaded defence rests on the proponent of the defence, unless the defence is a bare denial of the claim: <span class="font-italic">Rabobank </span>at [31].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The party asserting a fact must raise sufficient evidence to prove the fact to the standard required. The other party succeeds insofar as it raises sufficient evidence to ensure that the asserting party is unable to prove the fact to the standard required: Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span>”) at para 12.006. The standard of proof required in civil trials is that of a balance of probabilities. Using a mathematical analogy, it is often said that this means proving the case on the basis of a 50+% standard: <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>at para 12.091. Whilst a mathematical analogy may provide some help in articulating the standard, the essential question remains whether the plaintiff has shown that his case is more probably true than it is false. This is a matter of judgment for the court. The scales of justice applied to evaluating the evidence and the burden and standard of proof is not a mathematical exercise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The party alleging that a document is a sham bears the burden of proving that the parties intended the document to be a pretence: <span class="font-italic">Chng Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye </span>[2013] 2 SLR 715 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Bee Kheng</span>”) at [51]. The crux of a sham is a common intention to mislead. However, there is a strong presumption that parties intend to be bound by the provisions of agreements which they have entered into. The reasons for this presumption are summarised in the following statement by Neuberger J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">National Westminister Bank plc v Rosemary Doreen Jones </span>[2001] BCLC 98 at [59]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Because a finding of sham carries with it a finding of dishonesty, because innocent third parties may often rely upon the genuineness of a provision or an agreement, and because the court places great weight on the existence and provisions of a formally signed document, there is a strong and natural presumption against holding a provision or document a sham. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 More evidence is required to prove an allegation of fraud or dishonesty in civil proceedings even though the standard of proof remains the civil standard of proof on a balance of probabilities. In <span class="font-italic">Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2015] 2 SLR 686 at [183]–[184], the Court of Appeal endorsed the following statement in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263: “the more serious the allegation, the more the party, on whose shoulders the burden of proof falls, may have to do if he hopes to establish his case”. Likewise, the learned author of <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation </span><span class="font-italic">Process</span> said at para 12.094 that there are cases where the court may require more cogent or forceful evidence before it finds that the civil standard has been met. He goes on further to say at 12.096 that where the court singles out fraud or other serious wrong as requiring proof based on more cogent and/or additional evidence, it is doing nothing more than applying its normal judicial reasoning to a particular situation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It is for the party who asserts that he has repaid a loan to prove that he had indeed discharged his indebtedness. In <span class="font-italic">Wee Yue Chew v Su Sh-Hsyu </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 212, the plaintiff claimed for unpaid amounts in relation to a share transfer. The defendant asserted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that she had paid for the shares by way of her remittance of the contract price to the plaintiff’s order. The court held that the defendant bore the legal burden to prove payment of the contract price and cited with approval the following statement from the Australian High Court in <span class="font-italic">Young v Queensland Trustees Limited </span>(1956) 99 CLR 560 at 569–570:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law was and is that, speaking generally, the defendant must allege and prove payment by way of discharge as a defence to an action for indebtedness in respect of an executed consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In <span class="font-italic">Chua Kok Tee David v DBS Bank Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 231, a claim was brought in respect of a fixed deposit placed with the bank back in 1983. In 2012, the customer claimed to uplift the deposit. In respect of the burden of proof, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J, after citing s 104 of the Evidence Act, held at [25]–[27]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t is a debtor who admits having borrowed money from a creditor who bears the burden of proving that he is not, at the time of the suit, indebted to the creditor. The defendant admits that it borrowed money from the plaintiff. The defendant accepts that the initial fixed deposit receipt issued for the 9246 account is genuine and accepts that it accurately records the terms of the initial fixed deposit placement on the 9246 account. The defendant thus accepts that, at least as at 13 March 1983, it was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum recorded in that receipt together with the interest accruing on it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 104, applied in the light of these admitted facts and in the light [of] its second illustration, places the burden of proof in this suit on the defendant. If the admitted facts were taken alone, they would make a finding that the defendant’s debt to the plaintiff existed and continues to exist inevitable. In other words, if there were no evidence adduced on either side in this suit, the admitted facts mean that the defendant would fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It bears noting the defence in the present dispute consists of positive averments such as: (a) that there was a “Tronic Group”; (b) that the CLAs were fictitious loan agreements; and (c) that the loans under the CLAs were<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>secretly<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>repaid. It is not disputed that the defendant bears the legal burden of proving the existence of such facts, on a balance of probabilities.

</div> He further argues that the plaintiffs’ case fails as long as there is sufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that at least S$100,000 was paid in cash by the defendant to the plaintiffs, since the plaintiffs’ case is that not a single cent was received by way of cash. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I disagree. The plaintiffs’ case is that they never received any cash repayments <span class="font-italic">o</span><span class="font-italic">f the loans extended under the CLAs</span>. Whilst the plaintiffs have similarly asserted that there were no secret cash repayments for the Show Assets, this issue is, strictly speaking, irrelevant to the central question of whether the loans had indeed been repaid by the defendant. That said, the cash payments for the Show Assets, if established, will go towards the general credibility of the plaintiffs’ witnesses. Put simply, beyond proving the fact of payments, the defendant also bears the burden of establishing the purpose of the payments. Were they repayments of the loans extended under the CLAs?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The core of the defence is that there never was any loan: the agreements were entered into to create the impression of loans. They were sham agreements entered into with the common intention to deceive third parties. The burden of proof rests on the defendant. It is in this context that the issue of alleged payments of cash to the plaintiffs by the defendant arises. These payments (if made) are said to establish that there <span class="font-italic">never </span>were any genuine loans intended. The passing of monies to the defendant and back to the plaintiff was “the device” used to create the false impression. This is not a case where the defendant admits that there is a loan or debt owing. His case is that there never were any loans: the passing of monies on top of the table and the almost immediate return under the table (so to speak) was for purposes of creating the sham. Bearing in mind that the defendant has the burden of establishing the sham, even if the court accepts that some payments were made to the plaintiffs, it is still necessary to consider the purpose for those payments. In short, although proof of some payments by the defendant is helpful to his case, this court must still assess the evidence in its totality in deciding whether on a balance of probabilities the defence of sham has been made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there was a “Tronic Group” as alleged</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendant’s pleaded case is that iTronic, TIPL, PPS, Tronic Technocrystal Pte Ltd (“Technocrystal”) and ARG were part of a group of companies under the Tronic banner (“Tronic Group”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Companies having a common source of control and which act as a single economic entity are usually described as a corporate group. That said, the terms “group of companies” or “corporate group” do not appear in the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed).

The entities in the alleged Tronic Group have different shareholders. Eric did not have overall control of TIPL, iTronic and Technocrystal.

The only logical explanation as to why the defendant would reward the plaintiffs with S$3m worth of shares is that the loans were genuine and unpaid and provided by way of financial support to the defendant in his attempt to list MCPL.

</div>
</div>
</div> There is no independent evidence to corroborate his allegation. At the trial, the defendant took the position that there are four categories of emails that have been adduced: (a) genuine; (b) sham; (c) partly genuine and partly sham; and (d) emails that were solely between Eric and Stephen on which the defendant said he could not comment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The plaintiffs have referred me to the following comment made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Koon Park and another v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another </span>[2013] 4 SLR 150 at [76]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is always important to test witnesses’ evidence against the objective facts and independent evidence. On the instant factual matrix, the e-mail correspondence between the parties is particularly persuasive because it is an objective record of the parties’ respective positions and intentions prior to their wrangle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 However, it must be emphasised that every case turns on its own facts. Whether or not the contemporaneous email records in each case is an accurate record of the parties’ respective positions and intentions prior to their wrangle must depend on the facts of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In the present case, it is particularly significant to bear in mind that there is an allegation of an overall sham that is said to have been set in motion right at the beginning of the parties’ commercial relationship. It is in this context that the significance of the slew of contemporaneous emails showing TIPL and PPS as pre-IPO investors is to be assessed. The paperwork, according to the defendant, was part of the mechanism to create the façade of outstanding convertible loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In <span class="font-italic">Chng Bee Kheng</span>, Chan Seng Onn J cited with approval earlier authorities which held that the true question is whether the documents represented the true relationship between the parties. This in turn depends on whether the documents were intended to create legal relationships and whether the parties did actually act according to the apparent purpose and tenor of the documents. The authorities surveyed in <span class="font-italic">Chng Bee Kheng</span> include the decision of GP Selvam JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">TKM (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Export Credit Insurance Corp of Singapore</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 858 and Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd v Chenab Contractor Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 375.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It follows that the court must be careful to avoid over relying on the objective intention as gleaned from the words of the documents in determining the question of sham. After all, if the sham is to be effective, the objective appearance must be taken as the reality. It follows that the test of whether the parties intend their agreement to be sham is subjective. What did the parties actually intend? For this reason, I agree with the comment of Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">Chng Bee Kheng</span> case that the court may have regard to a wider category of evidence (beyond the documents themselves) such as the parties’ subsequent conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The key question is whether the email exchanges are part of an elaborate and lengthy masquerade in which the plaintiffs were participating as part of the charade that was agreed upon at the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I find that the sheer volume of contemporaneous emails between Eric, Stephen and the defendant as well as the subsequent conduct of the parties support the plaintiffs’ case that the loans are genuine and unpaid. In particular, the subsequent conduct of the parties (including the engagement of debt collectors) also supports the objective impression created by the loan agreements as it strains belief that the engagement of debt collectors was also part of the facade. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In contrast, the defendant’s evidence was uncorroborated, inconsistent, illogical and sometimes contradictory. When the flaws in his reasoning were pointed out, his explanations often appeared contrived and ill-founded. I will give a few examples. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 On some occasions, the defendant appeared to be unsure, or even worse, lying about whether an email was genuine or a sham. For instance, he claimed initially that his email to Eric on 29 December 2010 was a sham. In that email, he said that he had issued a cheque drawn on his account with the Australian and New Zealand Bank (“ANZ Bank”) for S$50,000 (“the ANZ Cheque”) as Compensation Sum B and that in the event of a redemption, “KW” (presumably KhattarWong) advised that they needed to “follow documentation and time frame”. Under cross-examination, he recanted his position and admitted that it was a genuine email.

It has been said that in time of war, the truth must be protected with a bodyguard of lies. It appears that the defendant in classifying some emails as comprising a mix of genuine and sham statements is trying to do the reverse: to protect the sham statements by dressing them up with genuine statements.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>In my judgment, looking at the email and bearing in mind the number of emails, it was inconceivable that the email was partly genuine and partly sham as alleged by the defendant.

Eric continued to chase for payments and even appointed debt collectors for that purpose. However, there was complete silence on the defendant’s part.

The defendant also argues that it would be illogical for the plaintiffs to continue engaging the same solicitors to assist in the drafting of the supplemental agreements if the solicitors had made such a grave error in the drafting of the Tronic and PPS CLAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The solicitors in question were not called to give evidence at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 On balance, I am not inclined to place much weight on the omission. For a start, whilst the words of cl 5.1A are clear – that there will be no repayment of the principal loans in the event that the listing does not succeed – it is undisputed that the parties later executed supplemental agreements to rectify the omission. This, in my judgment, negates the significance of the omission. There would be no reason for the parties to rectify the omission if they had intended the omission from the very beginning. Further, an express provision that the principal loan would not be paid runs against a recurring theme in the defendant’s case — the need to avoid detection of the alleged scheme. It would certainly have raised eyebrows if the auditors or the stakeholders in the plaintiff-companies realised the implication of what was provided in cl 5.1A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In short, I am of the view that the existence of cl 5.1A in the original agreements does not undermine the plaintiffs’ case that the loans are genuine and unpaid. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third-party guarantee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 It is undisputed that the defendant procured third parties to act as guarantors <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the CLAs.

Notably, the SMS was sent on 4 June 2011 and the “Monday” that was referred to in the SMS was 6 June 2011, the date on which PPS 2SA was signed. The defendant alleges that S$100,000 in cash had indeed changed hands from the defendant to Eric on 8 June 2011, the Wednesday that was referred to in the same SMS and cites, in support of his assertion, Stephen’s evidence that S$100,000 of cash was handed over by the defendant to Eric on 8 June 2011. The defendant has also adduced evidence of a secret recording in which Stephen was allegedly shocked to learn of Eric’s denial that the defendant had made cash repayments to him.

For instance, there is evidence of a S$300,000 cash deposit into another bank account belonging to the defendant on the same day that the defendant claims to have withdrawn and paid S$300,000 in cash to Eric. The plaintiffs also rely on Stephen’s evidence that the cash repayments, even if they were made, had nothing to do with the CLAs.

In saying this, I note that the evidence on the cash payments was “thin.” Stephen had difficulty in recalling with precision the specific details concerning each cash payment made between 2010 and 2011. It appeared that his answers to questions posed by the defendant’s counsel were rather tentative and guided primarily by the documents that were placed before him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Further, Stephen’s evidence did not unequivocally point to the conclusion that the cash was handed over for the purpose of repaying the loans.

</div> whereas the defendant says that the S$100,000 cheque was part of the repayment of the Tronic loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I do not accept that the cheque was part of the repayment of the Tronic loan. For a start, the defendant’s assertion that the cheque was intended as repayment of the Tronic loan is contrary to his entire case which is that the alleged repayments were deliberately made in cash so as to avoid leaving behind any “paper trail” which would jeopardise the scheme. Critically, he consciously chose not to document those cash repayments. It thus beggars belief that the defendant would later effect a partial repayment of the Tronic loan by way of a cheque since the cheque itself would form a “paper trail” that he so desperately wanted to avoid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 During re-examination, the defendant explained that the payment was made by cheque to give confidence to TIPL’s auditors that he (the borrower) had the ability to pay. I find it extremely difficult to accept his explanation. Had the parties intended the S$100,000 cheque payment to reduce the defendant’s loan obligations to paper, there must have been a corresponding written record stating that TIPL would be entitled to a reduced value of shares upon MCPL’s listing. Otherwise, TIPL would still be entitled to S$3m worth of shares upon MCPL’s listing (notwithstanding the S$100,000 repayment) and this would have unnecessarily aroused the suspicion of the relevant parties. There was no such record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Therefore, I prefer Eric’s evidence on this point and I accept that the S$100,000 cheque was intended as repayment Tronic Compensation Sums B and C. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Set-off</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The defendant asserts that S$100,000 of the PPS Principal Convertible Loan was repaid by way of a set-off against a debt of S$150,000 owed by ARG to Carrindon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I do not accept his assertion. First, I have found that there was no “Tronic Group” as alleged by the defendant. It would be illogical to set off part of the PPS Principal Convertible Loan against a debt owed by ARG to Carrindon. Second, the defendant admitted that TIPL could not sell the Show Assets to Carrindon because the Show Assets had been sold to ARG.

First, the date of the Payment Voucher is 7 December 2010. The defendant claims that his staff could have forgotten to change the date. Arguably, his staff may have forgotten to change the date on the Payment Voucher whilst modifying a previous payment voucher. However, it is strange that the defendant never thought to raise this point in his pleadings or AEIC and his explanation only surfaced at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Second, the payment voucher was from MPL and the defendant conceded that he did not explain why it was so when the ANZ Cheque was a personal cheque from him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Third, whilst Guo Pei Pei may have filed an interlocutory affidavit to attest to the authenticity of the Payment Voucher,

In this regard, it is important to remember the context in which evidence is given in court – the witness is under intense scrutiny of the judge and is also under pressure to answer counsel’s questions; even truthful witnesses may wilt and display discomfort in such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Court of Appeal at [56] added that a witness should not be found to be less credible merely because of gaps in his memory especially where a long time has elapsed.

The totality of the evidence will of course include contemporaneous objective documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Eric and Derek were forthcoming about the fact that they lied about the Carrindon-ARG agreements. That said, their complete denial of receiving cash payments from the defendant which was contradicted by documentary evidence (of the SMS sent by Stephen to the defendant on 4 June 2011) and Stephen’s evidence in general has been noted earlier. This evidence whilst tending to undermine their general credibility has to be assessed in relation to the complicated dealings between the parties that started with the acquisition of the Show Assets that has been described above. To be clear, the defendant has not satisfied me that any payments in cash were in respect of the CLAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The defendant’s demeanour was aggressive and bordered, at times, on rudeness to counsel.

When asked when he first approached Prime Partners, the defendant answered: “Oh I know Prime for many years.”

</div> When cross-examined on the role of Prime Partners and Mark Liew, the defendant agreed that he was not alleging that Prime Partmers and Mark Liew were involved in the sham.

</div> Indeed, it bears repeating that the defendant had elected to accept Mark Liew’s evidence without cross-examination. And yet when referred to Mark Liew’s evidence that the plaintiffs did not play any role or part at all during the entire listing process, save for being represented as pre-IPO investors by the defendant, his response was a terse: “he has to say like that, then what else you want him to say. Mark Liew is a professional, he has to say like that, that’s the reality if things”.

When he was cross-examined on an email sent by a Mactus employee attaching an audited report for 2007, the defendant asserts that this email was also sham and part of the elaborate paper trail. The defendant claimed that the employee who sent the email was unaware of what was going on. His explanation was that “the whole façade is get as many people in the company to be aware of these things going on.” The defendant added that whilst his claims sound unbelievable and incredible, they were true.

</div> He also admits to taking the benefit of the sham sale by TIPL to Carrindon and then to ARG to further dress up the books of MCPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 One key plank of the defendant’s case is that the deals could not have been genuine given that the Eric and the defendant had just met shortly before the plans for the deals were hatched. In the same tenor, why would the defendant, after meeting Eric for just a few weeks, be prepared to go into such a complicated series of fictitious deals? Further, why would he be prepared to pay S$3m to TIPL/PPS for the plaintiffs’ or Eric’s general help and advice on top of payments to the professional advisers that were already engaged for the Listing Exercise?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 After the relationship between the parties broke down, the defendant made no attempt to articulate the “fiction” in the deals. He did not approach Eric directly to unwind the deal and protest the claims. Neither did he protest even when Eric appointed debt collectors to demand the repayment of the loans. How could he possibly have felt that the appointment of debt collectors was also part of the façade when he was already having so many doubts and the relationship between the parties had already deteriorated?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The defendant also appeared to be making things up as he went along to extricate himself from difficult positions. That much was clear from the inherent inconsistencies and the loopholes in his evidence. Bearing in mind the defendant’s legal burden of proving that the CLAs were intended by the parties to be fictitious, his evidence was clearly insufficient to discharge that burden. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Overall, whilst some aspects of the evidence of Eric, Stephen and Derek were fuzzy and poor, their version of events on the whole was more credible than the defendant’s. All the contemporaneous documents and emails are consistent with the plaintiffs’ case. The plaintiffs were prepared to concede that the Carrindon deal was improper. Stephen’s evidence on the whole is consistent with the plaintiffs’ save in respect of the cash repayments that he claimed to have witnessed. Mark Liew’s evidence supports generally the plaintiffs’ position that they were genuine pre-IPO investors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Although the defendant has alleged that many of the emails were sham, or staged for the purposes of creating a “paper trail”, his evidence was poor. The language and tone of many of the emails (some of which have been set out above) strongly ring true – if they were staged – the degree of coordination, planning and sheer dogged effort defies belief. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the compensation sums amounted to penalties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161  Bearing in mind my finding that the monies owed under the CLAs have not been paid by the defendant, I now turn to the issue of whether the compensation sums prescribed thereunder amount to penalties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 It is a longstanding rule that clauses <span class="font-italic">providing for remedies upon breach</span> are unenforceable if they amount to penalties. The preliminary question that arises is whether the clauses provide for remedies upon breach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, secondary obligations). According to <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2014) at para 80.573:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The inquiry whether a provision is penal is only relevant when it is a sum payable upon breach. Where the stipulated sum is payable upon other events (eg, exercise of a right to terminate), it is not susceptible to invalidation on the ground that it is a penalty clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I pause here to note the distinction between claims for payment of a debt and claims for damages – the former being a primary obligation and the latter being a secondary obligation that arises upon breach. The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>vol 1 (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) at para 21-041 explains the position:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is an important distinction between a claim for payment of a debt and a claim for damages for breach of contract. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A debt is a definite sum of money fixed by the agreement of the parties as payable by one party in return for the performance of a specified obligation by the other party or on the occurrence of some specified event or condition</span>; whereas, damages may be claimed from a party who has broken his primary contractual obligation in some way other than by failure to pay such a debt. (It is also possible that, in addition to a claim for a debt, there may be a claim for damages in respect of consequential loss caused by the failure to pay the debt at the due date.) The relevance of this distinction is that rules on damages do not apply to a claim for a debt, e.g. the claimant who claims payment of a debt need not prove anything more than its performance or the occurrence of the event or condition; there is no need for it to prove any actual loss suffered by it as a result of the defendant’s failure to pay; the whole concept of the remoteness of damage is therefore irrelevant; <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the law on penalties does not apply to the agreed sum</span>; and the claimant’s duty to mitigate its loss does not generally apply.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 It thus follows that it is necessary to distinguish conditional primary obligations from secondary obligations before invoking the rule against penalties. The basic distinction between primary and secondary obligations is set out in the seminal decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</span> [1980] AC 827 (“<span class="font-italic">Photo Production</span>”). Primary obligations are the legal obligations imposed upon each party to the contract to procure whatever he has promised to do: that what is promised to be done, will be done. A breach of the primary obligation leads to the secondary obligation to pay monetary compensation for the loss sustained by the other party in consequence of the breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 This distinction appears to have made its way into Singapore law subsequently. In <span class="font-italic">Chia Kok Leong </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Prosperland Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 484 at [29], the Court of Appeal endorsed Lord Millett’s speech in <span class="font-italic">Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd v Panatown Ltd</span> [2001] 1 AC 518 which applied the distinction between primary and secondary obligations. Further support for this distinction may be found in <span class="font-italic">Emjay Enterprises Pte Ltd v Skylift Consolidator (Pte) Ltd (Direct Services (HK) Ltd, third party) </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 268<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13] in which the High Court accepted Lord Diplock’s exposition on this point in <span class="font-italic">Photo Production</span>. In <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 20.048, it is noted that although the Court of Appeal has not directly and expressly dealt with the issue, the distinction was impliedly accepted as good law in <span class="font-italic">Sun Technosystems Pte Ltd v Federal Express Services (M) Sdn Bhd</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 411 at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The importance of the distinction is that the penalty rule does not apply to a primary obligation to pay an agreed sum. The penalty rule strikes at clauses which provide that, upon <span class="font-italic">breach </span>of a primary obligation, a secondary obligation arises on the part of the party in breach to pay a sum of money that does not represent a genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be sustained as the result of the <span class="font-italic">breach </span>of the primary obligation but, rather, an amount that is substantially in excess of that sum: <span class="font-italic">Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co AB v Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana (The Scaptrade)</span> [1983] AC 694 at 702.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The distinction between a primary obligation to pay a sum of money and secondary obligations was considered in the context of the application of the penalty rule in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square Holding BV v Makdessi </span>[2015] UKSC 67 (“<span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span>”). The UK Supreme Court at [13] underscored the principle that the penalty rule only regulated remedies available for breach of a party’s primary obligations, not the primary obligations themselves.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The following passage at [14] from the judgment<span class="font-italic"> </span>is instructive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]n some cases the application of the penalty rule may depend on how the relevant obligation is framed in the instrument, ie whether as a conditional primary obligation or a secondary obligation providing a contractual alternative to damages at law. Thus, where a contract contains an obligation on one party to perform an act, and also provides that, if he does not perform it, he will pay the other party a specified sum of money, the obligation to pay the specified sum is a secondary obligation which is capable of being a penalty; but <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if the contract does not impose (expressly or impliedly) an obligation to perform the act, but simply provides that, if one party does not perform, he will pay the other party a specified sum, the obligation to pay the specified sum is a conditional primary obligation and cannot be a penalty.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168  Whilst this point was not directly raised by the parties, the first issue must be whether the provision for repayment at hand is in the nature of a primary obligation or whether it is a clause that attempts to deal with the secondary obligation to pay damages for the breach of primary obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Returning to the case at hand, these are loan agreements with an <span class="font-italic">option</span> to convert the loan into shares should the listing succeed.

The plaintiffs were to loan the defendant the specified sum. In the event that the defendant succeeded in his attempt to list MPCL, the plaintiffs could elect to convert the loans into $3m of shares. Should they decline to do so, they could demand the repayment of the principal sum and Additional Sums (that were termed “compensation sums”) that were specified in the CLAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Notwithstanding the use of the expression “Compensation Sum”, I am of the view that the “compensation sums” were not stipulated as a remedy for a breach of a primary obligation. Listing on the stock exchange is a complex exercise and requires the sanction and approval of the regulators. There is a range of reasons behind the failure of each listing exercise and not all may be within the control of the parties. Here, the CLAs do not impose any obligation on the defendant (whether expressly or impliedly) to procure MCPL’s listing by 30 June 2012. Since there is no obligation to list, it necessarily follows that MCPL’s failure to list by 30 June 2012 is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> an event of breach. Accordingly, the defendant’s repayment obligation is not a secondary obligation since it does not arise upon an event of breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In my judgment, the defendant’s repayment obligation under cll 2.3 and 3.3 of Tronic 2SA and PPS 3SA respectively is better characterised as a <span class="font-italic">conditional primary obligation</span> which crystallises upon the occurrence of an event, that is, the failure of MCPL to list by 30 June 2012. In the event that the Listing Exercise fails to take place by 30 June 2012, the CLAs revert to simple loan agreements under which the defendant is contractually obligated to repay what he has borrowed. Seen in this context, it is evident that the Additional Sums were intended as interest to compensate – even if rather generously – the plaintiffs for the loss of use of money (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the cost of money) between June 2011 and June 2012. Thus, the Additional Sums constitute part of the primary obligation of the defendant to repay the debt he owed to the plaintiffs. In the circumstances, the rule against penalties does not bite since the defendant’s repayment obligations under cll 2.3 and 3.3 of Tronic 2SA and PPS 3SA are primary obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Nevertheless, the parties did not raise the question as to whether the payment clause was a primary or secondary obligation. In the event that I am wrong (and the clauses do deal with payments for<span class="font-italic"> breach</span> of primary obligations) I am not persuaded that the Additional Sums are so exorbitant or excessive that they ought to be struck down as penalties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In <span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengyan v Geng Changqing</span> [2015] 3 SLR 732, the Court of Appeal at [78] affirmed that the basic principles applicable to the question whether a sum is void as being a penalty remain those set out in <span class="font-italic">Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage and Motor Co Ltd</span> [1915] AC 79 (“<span class="font-italic">Dunlop Pneumatic</span>”). Whilst I note that the UK Supreme Court has recently, in the case of <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span>, re-defined the test for penalties, Lord Dunedin’s four tests in <span class="font-italic">Dunlop Pneumatic</span> was said to be adequate and applicable in cases involving straightforward damages clauses: <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> at [32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 It is not necessary to set out or review in detail the principles in relation to the rule against penalties. It suffices to highlight some key points. The sum will be held to be a penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in comparison with the greatest loss that could reasonably or proved to have followed from the breach: see Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel: The Law of Contract </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2011) at para 20-139.That said, it has been held that a clause will not become a penalty simply because it “results in overpayment in particular circumstances” and that “[t]he parties are allowed a generous margin” to determine the agreed damages to be payable upon breach: <span class="font-italic">Murray v Leisureplay Plc</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 963 at [43].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 More importantly, in a negotiated contract between properly advised parties of comparable bargaining power, the strong initial presumption must be that the parties themselves are the best judges of what is legitimate in a provision dealing with the consequences of breach: <span class="font-italic">Cavendish </span>at [35]. It is not for the courts to relieve a party from the consequences of what may prove to be an onerous or possibly even a commercially imprudent bargain: <span class="font-italic">Export Credits Guarantee Department v Universal Oil Products Co</span> [1983] 1 WLR 399 at 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 In the present case, the defendant’s assertion that he was in a weaker bargaining position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the plaintiffs was unsubstantiated. As pointed out by the plaintiffs, the loan agreements were thoroughly negotiated with the advice of solicitors. The Additional Sums are 10% of the corresponding loan amounts. The defendant has not placed before me any material suggesting that such an “interest rate” is wildly out of proportion to those imposed on comparable loans of such nature. Thus, I would not be prepared to accept the defendant’s contention that the Additional Sums amount to penalties <span class="font-italic">even if</span> I had found earlier that they were remedies that were to be paid upon breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Indeed, it has to be said that if the defendant had succeeded in listing MCPL, the plaintiffs had a contractual option to convert the loans into shares of an amount that was double the value of the loans. When compared to the value of shares that the plaintiffs would have obtained had the listing succeeded, the Additional Sums required to be paid if the listing plans fell through are not extravagant and unconscionable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’ claims are allowed with costs to be taxed if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 As a post-script, the court wishes to place on record its appreciation for counsel’s helpful submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sim Chong and Alex Goh Wei Sien (JLC Advisors LLP) <br/>for the plaintiffs;<br/>Pradeep G Pillai, Joycelyn Lin and Simren Kaur Sandhu <br/>(Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
