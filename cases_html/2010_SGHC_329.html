<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Increasingly, parties who claim to be defamed
                    are resorting to preliminary determination under O 14 r 12 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) on meaning of the offending
                    words as a precursor to either summary judgment or the trial. In some cases, the
                    determination has led to summary judgment while in others it has resulted in a
                    bifurcation of the suit in that the trial judge who eventually heard the
                    defamation action was required to decide the case based on a meaning
                    pre-determined by another judge. The undesirability of such a practice in
                    certain situations was noted in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd
                        and others</em> [2010] 3 SLR 110 (“<em>Basil Anthony</em>”). Essentially, the Court of Appeal
                    observed that the court should refrain from giving an opinion on meaning where
                    there are clearly triable defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The <em>raison
                        d’etre</em> for the observations in <em>Basil
                        Anthony</em> is simply the recognition that bifurcation of the trial
                    process in situations where there are triable defences can only lead to multiple
                    routes of appeal which would inevitably lead to more cost, expense and time. As
                    such, this decision will trace the genesis of O 14 r 12 in order to
                    determine when such a preliminary determination on meaning in defamation suits
                    would be appropriate so as not to derogate from the objective and rationale
                    behind its introduction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The offending words, which formed the subject
                    matter of the present defamation suit, were published in an article posted on a
                    blog. The article sought to expose the practice of a particular teacher, the
                    plaintiff, in extracting donations from foreign students to guarantee placement
                    in a school in spite of the students failing the placement test. The article
                    accused the plaintiff of several acts of improper conduct. Each of the alleged
                    acts is linked to the practice of improper placement in the
                school.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The principal dispute on the pleaded meaning
                    between the parties was whether the article had accused the plaintiff of
                    improperly extracting donations on behalf of the school or had pocketed the
                    donations herself. It is apparent that both pleaded meanings are defamatory. The
                    significance in the difference lies in the defence of justification. The
                    defendant seeks to justify the former meaning but is admittedly unable to
                    justify the latter. The Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) determined
                    that the article had accused the plaintiff of accepting <em>bribes</em> for her own benefit. The only remaining pleaded defence
                    by the defendant was justification. However, the reference point for any
                    justification defence must be the meaning of the offending words. It follows
                    that in order to determine whether triable issues have been raised in relation
                    to the justification defence, it is axiomatic that the court must first make a
                    determination on meaning. This decision will therefore examine, <em>inter alia</em>, how such an approach is to be reconciled
                    with the observations made in <em>Basil
                    Anthony</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 23 July 2009, the plaintiff,
                    [ANB] (“the plaintiff”), brought a defamation action
                    against the defendant, [ANF] (“the defendant’), in
                    respect of an article which the defendant had posted on her web blog
                    (“the Article”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Article was about two pages long, and read
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[ANB] was the HOD (English) at [B] Secondary School. She was also in
                        charge of foreign students applying at the school. She wielded so much
                        power. Can ask the school clerks [K] and [L], they know
                        everything.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">She was sacked. But her successor told the students that she retired. The
                        civil servant lied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I used to send my foreign students to take entrance tests in [B] Secondary
                        School. So many years of sending them, only two got admitted. [ANB]
                        demanded S$3000 cash for each student in donation. Cash ah, no cheques. Die
                        die also must go ATM to withdraw cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One particular guardian stood out, [M]. A Taiwanese
                        married to an Indian. Co-incidentally the principal of [B] Secondary School
                        then was a [N].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Many of [M]’s foreign students were accepted in [B]
                        Secondary School and [B] Primary School. Other foreign students have to
                        register with so many schools to take entrance tests, her students only have
                        to sit for test at these schools and sure to enter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I tutored one of her Taiwanese students once. Before his entrance test, he
                        was given the essay topic and letter writing to practise with me!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Later I learnt that the entrance tests were fixed. The foreign students of
                        selected guardians would write their phone numbers on the test papers. This
                        ensure the students would be given a place regardless of their results.
                        Wow!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[ANB] was sacked because of [M]. The Chinese proverb
                        says, “Go up the hill too often, sure to meet a tiger.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Chinese failed her entrance test at [B] Secondary School. She was
                        referred to [M] who not only got her a place in [B]
                        Secondary School but a place in her homestay. That angered probably the
                        guardian of the girl. That was how [ANB] was exposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[ANB] was sacked, all retirement benefits vanished into thin
                        air.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[ANB] was mad, she called up other guardians to find out if they were the
                        ones who made the complaint. She was not remorseful and was looking for
                        someone to blame.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[M] took her in as a tutor for her foreign
                        students.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I’m surprised, no further investigations were done. MOE didn’t
                        refer her to CPIB. No mention of this in our papers. Blackout.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That’s why the civil servants get bolder and bolder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The things an educator will do for performance bonus. [ANB] is not
                        the only bold one. There are plenty in our government schools. I’ll
                        have to expose them one by one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff contended that the ordinary
                    meaning of the Article meant and was understood to mean that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he Plaintiff was sacked as a teacher and lost her retirement benefits
                        because the Plaintiff was corrupt in accepting bribes from the guardians of
                        children applying for places in [B] Secondary School.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendant disagreed with the plaintiff that
                    the ordinary meaning of the Article was that the plaintiff had accepted bribes
                    from guardians of children applying for places in [B] Secondary School
                    (“[B]SS”). In her Defence (Amendment No. 1) filed on
                    27 August 2010, the defendant pleaded that the Article meant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8A(i) that the Plaintiff did not accord fair and equal
                            treatment to all guardians who had attempted to register their foreign
                            students at [B] Secondary school;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8A(ii)    that the Plaintiff had on behalf of [B]
                            Secondary School, improperly accepted cash donations of S$3000 each from
                            some guardians of the foreign students. These donations were made to
                            guarantee the admissions of these foreign students (whose guardians had
                            made the said donations) into [B] Secondary School regardless of their
                            placement test results;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8A(iii)    that the Plaintiff’s solicitation and
                            collection of donations in exchange for the grant of limited publicly
                            funded places in government schools to foreign students (regardless of
                            their placement test results) amounts to an improper conduct on the part
                            of a public servant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8A(iv)    by her improper conduct of accepting donations
                            (on behalf of [B] Secondary School) in exchange for guaranteed
                            admissions of foreign students, the Plaintiff was hoping to secure a
                            better performance bonus for herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons [xxx]/2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 2 October 2009, the plaintiff filed an
                application in Summons [xxx]/2009 (“SUM [xxx]”) under O 14
                    r 12, for determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article.
                    SUM [xxx] also included an application for interlocutory judgment on the ground
                    that the defendant had no defence to the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant’s response to SUM [xxx] was
                    that it was not appropriate for the Court to make a determination of meaning at
                    this stage of the proceedings. In the event that the Court decided that
                    determination of meaning was appropriate, the proper meaning of the Article was
                    simply that the plaintiff had accepted cash donations of $3000 per student from
                    guardians of foreign students who were accepted into [B]SS regardless of the
                    placement test results. Finally, the defendant also claimed that the plaintiff
                    should not be granted summary judgment because there were triable
                    defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     SUM [xxx] was heard by the AR on
                    24 November 2009. The AR first found, as a preliminary point, that it was
                    appropriate to make an O 14 r 12 determination on the meaning of the
                    Article. During the hearing, the AR then raised the issue whether comments made
                    by third parties on the blog on which the Article was posted could be taken into
                    account in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article. He then
                    invited the parties to make further submissions on this issue, and indicated
                    that he would give his decision on 8 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 8 December 2009, the AR delivered his
                    decision. The AR first stated that he had not relied on the comments that had
                    appeared on the blog because these comments had not been pleaded by the
                    plaintiff, and were in any case extrinsic evidence. As to the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the Article, the AR found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he natural and ordinary meaning of the Article is that the Plaintiff
                        was corrupt. She was corrupt because she had accepted cash bribes of S$3000
                        from guardians of foreign students. These bribes were made to guarantee
                        acceptance of these foreign students into [B] Secondary School and were
                        received by the Plaintiff herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After the AR’s decision on meaning was
                    delivered, the matter was stood down at the request of counsel for the
                    defendant. Thereafter, the remaining application for summary judgment was
                    scheduled for a half-day special hearing before the AR in the second week of
                    January 2010. The AR, however, did not eventually hear the summary judgment
                    application because the defendant proceeded with her appeal against the decision
                    on meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 18 December 2009, the defendant filed
                    a notice of appeal against the AR’s decision both on the appropriateness
                    of his determination on meaning as well as his actual determination of the
                    natural and ordinary meaning of the Article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I heard the appeal on 1 February 2010 and
                    reserved judgment. In the course of drafting my decision, the Court of Appeal
                    delivered its decision in <em>Basil Anthony</em> on
                    7 April 2010, which contained important dicta on the use of O14 r 12
                    in defamation cases and observed specifically that preliminary determination on
                    meaning should not be made where there are triable defences. While I was
                    considering whether to invite the parties to submit on the relevance of
                        <em>Basil Anthony</em> and more specifically whether I
                    should reconvene the hearing to consider the pleaded defences prior to arriving
                    at my determination on meaning, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Adrian Tan,
                    commendably wrote in on 25 May 2010 to draw the court’s attention to
                        <em>Basil Anthony</em> and submitted that it would be
                    appropriate for the court to hear the plaintiff’s application for summary
                    judgment before arriving at a decision on the defendant’s appeal against
                    the AR’s decision on meaning. In the meantime, the defendant (by that time
                    the defendant’s solicitor and counsel had discharged themselves from
                    further acting for the defendant) also wrote in to inform the court of the
                    decision in <em>Basil Anthony</em>. On 23 June 2010,
                    the parties appeared before me. The defendant appeared in person and informed
                    the court that she was agreeable to the plaintiff’s proposal for the
                    summary judgment application to be heard in tandem with her appeal on the
                    determination of meaning. This was in fact a course of action which was
                    favourable to the defendant in that if I should find that there were triable
                    defences, I should decline to make a determination on meaning in light of the
                    guidance provided by the Court Of Appeal in <em>Basil
                        Anthony</em>. The defendant requested for time to instruct a new
                    lawyer to represent her. I acceded to her request and was informed on
                    14 July 2010 that the defendant had instructed Mr Michael Palmer, who
                    then requested to adjourn the appeal hearing in order to file an application to
                    amend the defence. After obtaining leave, the amended defence was filed on
                    30 August 2010 in which the defendant deleted the defences of qualified
                    privilege and fair comment leaving justification as the only remaining defence
                    for consideration. The amendments which were introduced by Mr Palmer
                    simplified the issues and certainly brought focus to the heart of the dispute
                    between the parties. The plaintiff’s application for summary judgment
                    together with the defendant’s appeal were eventually heard by me on
                    20 September 2010. To be fair to the defendant’s previous counsel,
                    Mr Yeo Hock Cheong, his submissions on meaning and the defence of
                    justification were similar to the arguments which were emphasised by
                    Mr Palmer during the reconvened hearing.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Use of O 14 r 12 in defamation actions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     O 14 r 12 which is titled
                    “Determination of questions of law or construction of documents”
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12. —(1) The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its
                        own motion, determine any <em>question of law</em> or
                        construction of any document arising in any cause or matter where it appears
                        to the Court that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    such <em>question</em> is

                            only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim or
                                <em>issue</em> therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Upon such determination, the Court may dismiss the
                            cause or matter or make such order or judgment as it thinks
                        just.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The Court shall not determine any question under
                            this Order unless the parties have had an opportunity of being heard on
                            the question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Nothing in this Order shall limit the powers of
                            the Court under Order 18, Rule 19, or any other provision of these
                            Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Before examining the merits of the appeal, a
                    few observations about the scope and ambit of O 14 r 12 should be
                    noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the rule is not intended to
                        deal with any issue or question arising from the pleadings. Instead, from
                        the wording of the rule itself, it is apparent that its purpose is
                        restricted to determine questions of law and construction of
                        documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, unlike a typical summary judgment application under O 14 by
                        the plaintiff, <em>any party</em> to the proceeding may
                        invoke O 14 r 12. Indeed, there are several reported decisions in
                        which the rule was invoked by the defendant to determine questions of law
                        with the view to dismissing the action: see <em>Payna
                            Chettiar v Maimoon bte Ismail</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 738
                            (“<em>Payna</em>”), <em>UCO Bank v Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd</em>
                        [2006] 1 SLR(R) 1 and <em>Japura Development Pte
                            Ltd v Singapore Telecommunications Ltd</em> [2000]
                        2 SLR(R) 1. O 14 r 12, when used in this manner,
                        provides a defendant with an alternative way to bring about a summary
                        dismissal of the claim which may not otherwise be available under the usual
                        striking out regime under O 18 r 19.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, the rule is not limited to dealing only
                        with defamation cases. This may appear to be stating the obvious but the
                        preponderance of local reported decisions on the use of O 14 r 12
                        happen to deal with defamation cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is perhaps apposite to begin my analysis by
                    first considering the decision in Microsoft Corp and others v <em>SM Summit Holdings Ltd and another and other appeals</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 465 (“<em>SM
                        Summit</em>”) which was the first reported case where O 14
                    r 12 was used in a defamation action to determine the meaning of the
                    offending words. <em>SM Summit</em> has been interpreted in
                    subsequent decisions (See below, at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>) as
                    permitting a bifurcation of the trial process in defamation cases. However, as
                    mentioned earlier, <em>Basil Anthony</em> expressed some
                    doubt whether <em>SM Summit</em> has been properly applied.
                    Following the decision in <em>Basil Anthony</em>, both
                    parties agreed that the effect of the observations made in <em>Basil Anthony</em> is that it would no longer be appropriate for a
                    court to give a preliminary determination of meaning under O 14 r 12
                    unless such determination leads to summary judgment. Accordingly, it was also
                    agreed by both parties that the defendant’s appeal should be considered in
                    tandem with the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment and that if I
                    arrive at the conclusion that there are triable defences, I should allow the
                    appeal. In light of these developments, it is perhaps timely to revisit the
                    decision in <em>SM Summit</em> and the practice which grew
                    up post- <em>SM Summit</em> of allowing pre-trial
                    determinations of meaning under O 14 r 12 in defamation
                cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Genesis of O 14 r 12</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     O 14 r 12 was first introduced into
                    our Rules of Court in 1994 as O 14A (“SG O 14A”). In
                    1996, SG O 14A was renamed as O 14 r 12 after the revamp of our
                    Rules of Court in their present form. In turn, SG O 14A was adopted from
                    the English Rules of Court and was in <em>pari materia</em>
                    with O 14A of the English Rules of Court (“O 14A”), which was
                    introduced in England in 1991.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     To determine whether O 14 r 12 is
                    suitable for pre-trial determination of meaning in defamation cases, it is
                    useful to examine the reasons for its introduction in England, as well as its
                    subsequent application by the English Courts from 1991 to 1999 (1999 was the
                    year where the Civil Procedure Rules were introduced in England).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Introduction of O 14A in the UK</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In Singapore (as well as in the UK prior to
                    1999), the Rules of Court are typically drafted and introduced by a Rules
                    Committee set up specifically to determine how the machinery of the court
                    process should operate. However, the proceedings of the Rules Committee are
                    confidential, and there is no equivalent of the Hansard or other preparatory
                    materials that can be used to interpret any particular provision of the Rules of
                    Court. The only sources we can look to for aid in interpreting O 14A are
                    from English case law, as well as academic opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The authors of <em>The Supreme
                        Court Practice</em> (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 1995 Ed), opined that
                    O 14A was not meant to allow parties to obtain a determination of a
                    standalone point law at the interlocutory stage, which would bind the trial
                    judge should the case proceed to trial. Rather, O 14A was introduced to
                    empower the court to dispose of complex issues of law to grant summary judgment
                    in situations when the case might otherwise not have qualified for summary
                    judgment under the existing O 14 procedure. As the authors noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The underlying policy of this Order is to accelerate the final judicial
                        disposal of an action at the interlocutory stage and thereby save the
                        expense and delay which would otherwise arise not only if the action were to
                        proceed to a full trial and also if the parties were be required to
                        undertake the necessary pre-trial steps to prepare for such
                        trial…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Order strengthens the powers of the Court when dealing with an
                        application for summary judgment under O.14, since in an appropriate case
                        the Court is able, instead of granting leave to defend on the basis that the
                        defendant has raised an arguable defence on a question of law, to proceed
                        directly to determine that question <em>and to give summary
                            judgment</em>… (at 14A/1-2/1)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question of law or construction which appears to be suitable for
                        determination without a full trial must also have the potential that its
                        determination will finally determine the entire cause or matter or any claim
                        or issue therein as, for example, the issue of liability, leaving the
                        question of damage and interest therein to be assessed subject only to any
                        possible appeal (para. 1(i)(h)). <em>Indeed the overall
                            objective of this Order is the final disposal of actions at the
                            interlocutory stage on the determination of a question of law or
                            construction…</em>(at 14A/1-2/6)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This need for O 14A stemmed from the
                    conflicting and inconsistent manner in which the English courts had approached
                    the summary judgment regime under O 14. Two divergent lines of authorities
                    as regards the treatment of complex issues of law under O 14 had been
                    developed by the English Court of Appeal. Under the first line of cases, the
                    court adhered strictly to the words of O 14 r 1, which provides that the
                    court should only grant summary judgment if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he defendant has no defence to a claim included in the writ, or to a
                        particular part of such a claim, or has no defence to such a claim or part
                        except as to the amount of any damages claimed…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The effect of this approach was that summary
                    judgment was denied as long as the defendant could raise a serious defence even
                    though the defence was based solely on a point of law that could have been
                    decided at the interlocutory stage without the need for further evidence. As
                    Parker LJ stated in <em>Home and Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v
                        Mentor Insurance Co (UK)</em> [1990] 1 WLR 153:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of Order 14 is to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick
                        judgment where there is plainly no defence to the claim. If the defendant's
                        only suggested defence is a point of law and the court can see at once that
                        the point is misconceived the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. If at first
                        sight the point appears to be arguable but with a relatively short argument
                        can be shown to be plainly unsustainable the plaintiff is also entitled to
                        judgment. But Order 14 proceedings should not in my view be allowed to
                        become a means for obtaining, in effect, an immediate trial of an action,
                        which will be the case if the court lends itself to determining on Order 14
                        applications points of law which may take hours or even days and the
                        citation of many authorities before the court is in a position to arrive at
                        a final decision. (at 158)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the point of law relied on by the defendant raises a serious question
                        to be tried which calls for detailed argument and mature consideration the
                        point is not suitable to be dealt with in Order 14 proceedings. (at
                        159)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The English Court of Appeal adopted a similar
                    approach in <em>The Coral</em> [1993] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 1. In that case, the plaintiff had applied for summary judgment against
                    the defendants on the ground that the entire dispute turned on the construction
                    of certain terms in the bills of lading, and that this was an issue of law that
                    could be dealt with at the interlocutory stage without having to go to trial.
                    Bedlam LJ rejected the plaintiff’s argument and held at 9
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, it is true that no further evidence could affect the
                        construction of the bills of lading but on the construction argued for by
                        the defendant issues of fact would have to be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant’s
                        construction of the bills of lading is so clearly unarguable that there is
                        no defence to the plaintiff’s claim. In these circumstances I consider
                        it unnecessary and undesirable to express my opinion on the proper
                        construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the other hand, a second line of cases
                    showed a greater readiness to deal with complex issues of law in an O 14
                    application where that issue of law was dispositive of the dispute in question.
                    For example, in <em>European Asian Bank AG v Punjab &amp; Sind
                        Bank (No.2)</em> [1983] 1 WLR 642, Goff LJ held that
                    summary judgment ought to be given in cases where the entire dispute turned on a
                    point of law, even when that point of law was a difficult one and the defendant
                    had raised a serious question as to how that point of law should be decided.
                    This willingness to deal with complex issues of law was similarly demonstrated
                    in <em>RG Carter Ltd v Clarke</em> [1990]
                    1 WLR 578, where Lord Donaldson MR stated at 584 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a judge is satisfied that there are no issues of fact between the
                        parties, it would be pointless for him to give leave to defend on the basis
                        that there was a triable issue of law. The only result would be that another
                        judge would have to consider the same arguments and decide that issue one
                        way or another. Even if the issue of law is complex and highly arguable, it
                        is far better if he then and there decides it himself, entering judgment for
                        the plaintiff or the defendant as the case may be on the basis of his
                        decision. The parties are then free to take the matter straight to this
                        court, if so advised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The divergent approaches to O 14
                    applications involving complex issues of law by the English Court of Appeal
                    became a cause for concern because there was serious doubt among the lower
                    courts as to which approach was the correct one. It was against this background
                    that O 14A was introduced into the English Rules of Court in 1991 to enable
                    the court to determine any <em>question of law</em>. In
                    other words, it gave legislative effect to the robust approach adopted by
                    Goff LJ and Lord Donaldson MR. O 14A mandated that where the court was
                    of the opinion that the defendant had raised an arguable defence on a <em>question of law</em>, it could proceed to determine that
                    issue of law in an interlocutory manner and grant summary
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The application of O 14A by the UK Courts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The background history of O 14A is
                    informative as to the purpose which it was intended to serve, and provides a
                    rational basis from which we can infer how O 14 r 12 should be applied
                    in Singapore. However, this only tells us half the story. There is still a need
                    to examine how the English courts have applied O 14A to assist in
                    determining the proper application of O 14 r 12. It is relevant to
                    point out that no direct guidance can be obtained from the English courts on the
                    use of O 14 r 12 in defamation cases simply because in England, unlike
                    Singapore, defamation cases are tried before a judge and a jury. In fact, this
                    salient distinction was highlighted in <em>SM Summit</em>
                    at [45]–[48].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There are three threshold requirements stated
                    in O 14A, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The question or issue for determination must
                            involve a question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The question must be suitable for determination
                            without a full trial of the action; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The determination will fully determine (subject
                            only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim or
                            issue therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Beginning with the first threshold requirement
                    – is determination of meaning of the offending words a question of fact or
                    law? In all previous decisions where O 14 r 12 was used to determine
                    meaning, it was assumed by the parties that determination of meaning involves a
                    question of law. If such meaning can be determined without reference to
                    extrinsic evidence or cross-examination of witnesses, the determination would
                    typically involve a question of law for the judge to decide. The situation is
                    however different if the plaintiff is relying on a true innuendo to determine
                    the meaning: see <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and
                        another</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 444. In such an event,
                    O 14 r 12 would not be appropriate since evidence would have to be
                    led. However, in the case before me, innuendo has not been
                pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As regards the second requirement, the phrase
                    “suitable for determination” has been interpreted to exclude all
                    questions that can only be answered with reference to disputed facts. Hence, the
                    interpretation of a contract will not be suitable for an O 14A
                    determination if the context in which the contract was signed is relevant in its
                    interpretation: see <em>Associated Dairies Ltd v Baines and
                        Others</em>, Court of Appeal, 6 July 1995. Similarly, the question of
                    whether there is a duty of care in tort is typically unsuitable for O 14A
                    determination because such a question would usually involve a mixed question of
                    law and fact: see <em>Cullin v London Fire and Civil Defence
                        Authority</em> [1999] PIQR P314. On the other hand, if the
                    question to be determined is a pure issue of law, it should usually be
                    “suitable for determination”, since by definition, a question of
                    law can always be decided without a trial or any fact finding
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The final requirement that the question of law
                    must fully determine the “entire cause or matter or any claim or
                        <em>issue</em>” offers the most challenge in the
                    proper interpretation of O 14 r 12. Conceptually, it is possible to
                    argue that there is no need for the “question”, which has to be
                    determined to dispose of the entire matter or cause of action. After all, the
                    word “<em>issue</em>” suggests that
                    O 14A can be used to determine a standalone legal issue that forms part of
                    the wider case. Such an interpretation would mean that the
                    “question” to be determined is equivalent to the “<em>issue</em>”. However, it is important not to lose
                    sight of the purpose of O 14A which is to save time, cost and expense.
                    Accordingly, an approach without addressing the issue whether time and cost
                    would be saved may undermine the efficacy of the operation of O 14A since
                    the determination of the “question” will, in every case, determine
                    the “<em>issue</em>” that is raised by the
                    “question” itself. A review of some English decisions on the
                    application of O 14A is therefore essential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Korso Finance
                        Establishment Anstalt v Wedge &amp; others</em>, Court of Appeal, 15
                    February 1994 (“<em>Korso</em>”), the English
                    Court of Appeal was faced with the question of whether it should make an
                    O 14A determination on the construction of certain documents. There was no
                    dispute that if the court construed the documents in the plaintiff’s
                    favour, the plaintiff would be entitled to summary judgment. On the other hand,
                    if the court construed it in the defendant’s favour, the dispute would
                    have to proceed to trial. At first instance, the English High Court held that
                    the matter was not suitable for an O 14A determination because, if it had
                    found for the defendants on the construction issue, the matter would not have
                    been “fully determined” and would have to proceed to trial. The
                    English Court of Appeal overturned this decision. Leggatt LJ held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he question of construction is well capable of constituting an issue in
                        the cause or matter. An issue may be said to be a disputed point of fact or
                        law relied on by way of claim or defence. In the present case the
                        determination of the question of construction one way or the other will
                        finally determine an important issue, namely whether the respondents are
                        primarily liable under the agreement. If the determination is in favour of
                        the appellant it will finally determine the entire matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, having rightly decided that the issue could properly be
                        disposed of without evidence and discovery, if he decided on the side of the
                        plaintiffs, it would determine the action. In any event the question of
                        construction was a dominant feature of the case, and the Judge ought to have
                        proceeded to determine that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     
          <em>Korso</em> raises two
                    interesting points about the proper construction of O 14A. First, it
                    suggests that an O 14A determination is appropriate even if it would only
                    “finally determine” the cause of action if it is decided in favour
                    of one party, usually the plaintiff. In such circumstances, if the question is
                    determined in favour of the other party, the result is simply that the other
                    party is given leave to defend. Second, <em>Korso</em>
                    acknowledged in dicta that the word “<em>issue</em>” in O 14A could be defined widely to include any
                    legal issue in the dispute. However, it is important to note that the actual
                    ratio in <em>Korso</em> did not go so far, since the effect
                    of determining the proper construction of the documents in that case in fact
                    resulted in the plaintiff obtaining summary judgment. As mentioned above at
                    [28], this result is entirely in line with the underlying purpose of O 14A.
                    Furthermore, the court emphasised that O 14A was appropriate because it
                    would decide a “dominant feature” of the case. This suggests there
                    are at least some standalone legal issues that may not be appropriate for
                    O 14A determination if they are not “dominant features” of
                    the case. Unfortunately, the English Court of Appeal did not provide any further
                    guidance as to what it meant by “dominant feature”, and we are
                    left none the clearer as to when O 14A should be used to determine a
                    standalone question of law. In my view, the introduction of a requirement that
                    the issue must be a dominant feature of the case in order to be suitable for
                    O14A determination is likely to cause more uncertainty and
                confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>State Bank of India v
                        Murjani Marketing Group Limited and Others</em>, English Court of
                    Appeal, 27 March 1991 [“<em>Murjani</em>”],
                    the plaintiff sought summary judgment to enforce a New York judgment against the
                    defendant. In order to succeed, the plaintiff had to succeed on three broad
                    issues. The first issue in turn involved two questions, namely:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To found jurisdiction in the New York Court other
                            than by agreement or submission, did Mr Murjani need to be present
                            or to reside in New York or both, at the time the proceedings were
                            issued or served?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If residence was necessary, was he, on the facts,
                            resident at the relevant time?</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff argued that the first question
                    was a pure issue of law that the court could decide under O 14A, and leave
                    the second question to be answered by the trial judge, if necessary. This
                    approach was however rejected by the English Court of Appeal. Taylor LJ
                    held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Keenan referred to O 14A rule 1 which came into
                        force only on 1st Ferbuary [<em>sic</em>] 1991, after
                        the judgment in this case. It is headed "Disposal of Case on Point of Law"
                        and provides as follows, so far as is relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"The Court may upon the application of a party or of its own motion
                            determine any question of law . . . in any cause . . . at any stage of
                            the proceedings where it appears to the Court that</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    such question is suitable for determination
                                without a full trial of the action, and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    such determination will finally determine
                                (subject only to any possible appeal) the entire cause . . . or any
                                claim or issue therein".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even under that rule, it could not be said here that to decide the issues
                        of law would determine the whole cause or indeed the issue as to residence.
                        In my judgment, the issues of fact concerning residence are so interwoven
                        with the legal issues raised in this case as to make it undesirable for the
                        court to split the legal and factual determinations. To do so would in
                        effect be to give legal rulings in vacuo or in a hypothetical footing which
                        the court will no do [<em>sic</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Murjani</em>, the
                    English Court of Appeal therefore declined to use O 14A to decide a
                    standalone issue of law because it would not have “finally
                    determined” the dispute or even the issue of residence between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In contrast to <em>Murjani</em> and <em>Korso</em>, the English
                    High Court in <em>Neptune (Vehicle Washing Equipment) Ltd v
                        Fitzgerald</em> [1996] Ch 274 (“<em>Neptune</em>”) adopted a converse position. In that case, the
                    plaintiff company had commenced an action against the defendant who was
                    previously the sole director of the company. The plaintiff claimed that the
                    defendant had breached s 317 of the UK Companies Act 1985
                    (“Companies Act (UK)”) by failing to declare his interest before
                    making certain decisions. The plaintiff could only succeed if he proved
                    that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">section 317 of the Companies Act applied even to
                            cases where a company only had a single director; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the defendant had not made the declaration of
                            interest</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Lightman J held that the first question
                    involved a pure issue of statutory interpretation that was amenable to an
                    O 14A determination. He found that s 317 of the Companies Act (UK)
                    indeed applied to cases where the company had a single director, and that the
                    defendant would be in breach of this provision if he had not made the
                    declaration. Accordingly, Lightman J answered the O 14A issue of law and
                    left it to the trial judge to determine whether the defendant had in fact made
                    the declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     
          <em>Neptune</em> is a
                    significant case in the O 14A jurisprudence because it suggests that
                    O 14A could be used to decide a free-standing point of law that will bind
                    the trial judge when the case proceeds to trial. This substantially widens the
                    scope of O 14A from its original purpose of affording greater avenues for
                    litigants to obtain summary judgment in cases involving disputes on complex
                    issues of law. However, it seems that generally, the judicial trend in the UK
                    was actually against the use of O 14A in such a manner. Two reasons may be
                    given for this. The first is general in nature, namely that all procedures which
                    have the effect of bifurcating the judicial process should not be encouraged.
                    The second is specific to O 14A itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     English case-law has cautioned against the
                    bifurcation of the court process into issues of law and fact, regardless of
                    whether the mechanism used is O 14A, O 33 r 2, or some other
                    provision in the Rules of Court. In <em>Morris and Another v.
                        Sanders Universal Products</em> [1954] 1 WLR 67
                        (“<em>Morris</em>”), the defendant in a
                    defamation case had sought an order under O 25 r 2 of the English Rules of Court
                    to determine, as a preliminary issue of law, whether the allegedly defamatory
                    article had any defamatory meaning. The first instance judge held that the
                    article had a defamatory meaning, and the defendant promptly appealed. The
                    English Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the merits, but expressed its
                    discomfort with the way the parties had used the Rules of Court to obtain a
                    bifurcation of a defamation case without any regard whether it would save time
                    and costs. Jenkins LJ stated at 73?74:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[B]ut I cannot part with this case without saying that, in my judgment,
                        the procedure under Ord. 25, r. 2, is a most unsuitable procedure for the
                        purpose for which it has been used in this case. <em>If
                            recourse is to be had to that rule on the question whether the words
                            complained of in a libel action are capable of a defamatory meaning, it
                            seems to me the practice may grow up of splitting libel actions into two
                            stages, the first being concerned with the aspect of the case with which
                            we have been occupied today, and the second being the trial of the case
                            itself in the event of the defendants failing to put a summary end to
                            the proceedings on the preliminary issue with which we are now dealing.
                            It seems to me that this would be a most undesirable practice and that a
                            question such as that now raised is not a proper subject for an
                            application under the procedure prescribed by Ord. 25, r.
                        2</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In similar vein, the House of Lords has also
                    criticized the practice of using the Rules of Court to obtain a bifurcation of
                    the judicial process. In <em>Tilling v Whiteman</em>
                    [1980] AC 1 (“<em>Tilling</em>”),
                    the plaintiff owner of a property had commenced proceedings to recover the
                    property from the defendant tenants. The plaintiff then applied to have a
                    particular provision of the UK Rent Act 1968 interpreted as a preliminary issue
                    of law under O 33 r 2. On appeal to the House of Lords, Lord Scarman
                    observed at [25] that the use of O 33 r 2 had resulted in more cost
                    and delay for the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The case presents two disturbing features. First, the decision in the B
                        county court was upon a preliminary point of law. Had an extra half-hour or
                        so been used to hear the evidence, one of two consequences would have
                        ensued. Either Mrs. Tilling would have been believed when she said she
                        required the house as a residence, or she would not. If the latter, that
                        would have been the end of the case. If the former, your Lordships' decision
                        allowing the appeal would now be final. As it is, the case has to go back to
                        the county court to be tried. <em>Preliminary points of law
                            are too often treacherous short cuts. Their price can be, as here,
                            delay, anxiety, and expense</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The second, and more specific judicial
                    reluctance to use O 14A to determine a standalone point of law was
                    explained by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Brain v Ingledew,
                        Brown, Bennison &amp; Garrett (No.1)</em> [1996] FSR 341
                        (“<em>Brain</em>”). In <em>Brain</em>, the plaintiff had commenced a suit against the defendants
                    under s 70 of the Patents Act 1977 (UK) in respect of certain threats made
                    by the defendants against the plaintiff. The English court made certain
                    declarations in favour of the plaintiff under O 14A, and the defendants
                    appealed. The English Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in respect of some of
                    the declarations, and further held that O 14A should not usually be used to
                    determine an issue of law that would not finally determine the claim.
                    Aldous LJ stated,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The judge only had jurisdiction under Ord. 14A to determine a question of
                        law or construction of a document which arose, <em>providing
                            that it was suitable for determination without a trial and it would
                            finally determine an issue</em>. That rule is a useful weapon in
                        the court's armoury, but should not be used unless the proper factual
                        background is in evidence. <em>Generally a party who wishes
                            an issue of law to be decided prior to trial should make an application
                            for the issue to be tried under Ord. 33 r. 2 so that the court has the
                            opportunity to decide whether the issue is suitable to be determined as
                            a preliminary issue and the best way to do so</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A similar view was echoed by Hobhouse LJ, who opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are various methods which a judge can adopt to bring about the
                        simplification of litigation. Ord. 14A is only one of them and its scope
                        does not extend to the summary trial of questions which include issues of
                        fact. Where there are issues of fact which also need to be resolved, other
                        methods must be adopted, for example, ordering particulars or statements on
                        oath so as to obtain admissions, or directing the trial of preliminary
                        issues. I say nothing about whether any such course would have been
                        appropriate at this stage in the present case, nor do I wish in any way to
                        discourage judges from adopting such methods in appropriate cases, but the
                        course which Jacob J. adopted in the present case was not one which was
                        open to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The English Court of Appeal in <em>Brain</em> appeared to have taken the view that insofar as
                    determination of preliminary issue is deemed desirable, the preferred route to
                    deal with it is perhaps under O 33 r 2 rather than under O 14A.
                    Unfortunately, it did not explain its preference for the O 33 r 2
                    mechanism over O 14A. Perhaps one advantage that O 33 r 2 is
                    perceived to have over O 14A in dealing with preliminary issues of law is
                    that it seldom leads to a situation of two different judges deciding the issues
                    of law and fact, since the judge who makes an O 33 r 2 order usually
                    decides the issues of law and fact in two different stages during the same
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In conclusion, the approach of English courts
                    with regard to the use of O 14A may be broadly summarized as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, O 14A is broad enough to
                        be used to determine a standalone issue of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, notwithstanding this, the courts are
                        slow to use it in such a manner because bifurcation of the trial process has
                        the potential to lead to greater expense and delay for the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        insofar as it is desirable to have an issue of law determined before the
                        trial, it may be preferable to use other procedures such as O 33
                        r 2 rather than resort to O 14A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Singapore Position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Although SG O 14A was introduced into the
                    Singapore Rules of Court as early as 1994, it received little attention even
                    after the 1996 reforms when it was redrafted as O 14 r 12. In fact, it
                    was only in 1997 when O 14 r 12 first became the subject of attention
                    in the case of <em>Payna</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Payna</em>, the
                    first defendant had obtained judgment against the plaintiff for ownership of
                    certain parcels of land. Subsequently, the land was conveyed to the second to
                    ninth defendants, and the conveyance was duly registered in the land registry.
                    The plaintiff then started an action against the defendants to set aside the
                    judgment on the ground that the first defendant had obtained it by fraud. It was
                    not alleged that the second to ninth defendants knew or ought to have known of
                    the purported fraud by the first defendant. The second to ninth defendants then
                    made an application under O 14 r 12 for a determination of law as to
                    whether the plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought. Chao J held that
                    this was a matter suitable for O 14 r 12. He stated at [34] and [35]
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    It does not follow
                            that an application under O 14 r 12 should only be made if the
                            decision would finally determine the entire cause or matter. This is
                            clear from the express wording of r 12(1)(<em>b</em>) itself — "such determination will fully
                            determine (subject only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or
                            matter or <em>any</em> claim or <em>issue
                            therein</em>".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The
                            English Court of Appeal had the opportunity to review the scope of
                            O 14A in the unreported 1994 case <em>Korso Finance
                                Establishment Anstalt v John Wedge</em>. The principles which
                            it laid down are set out in para 14A/1-2/4 of the <em>Supreme Court Practice</em> and they are as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">An issue is a disputed point of fact or law

                                constituting an issue.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">3</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">If a question of construction will finally
                                determine whether an important issue is suitable for determination
                                under O 14A and where it is a dominant feature of the case a
                                Court ought to proceed to so determine such issue.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">4</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Respondents to an application under O 14A
                                are not entitled to contend they should be allowed to hunt around
                                for evidence or something that might turn up on discovery which
                                could be relied upon to explain or modify the meaning of the
                                relevant document. If there were material circumstances of which the
                                Court should take account in construing the document they must be
                                taken to have been known, and could only be such as were known, to
                                the parties when the agreement was made. In the absence of such
                                evidence the Court should not refrain from dealing with the
                                application.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It must be noted that although Chao J had
                    observed that O 14 r 12 could be used to determine issues of law even
                    when such determination would not finally determine the entire dispute, he
                    ultimately allowed its use in <em>Payna</em> because it
                    resulted in summary dismissal of the claim against the second to ninth
                    defendants. As Chao J stated at [31] and [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    For all the above reasons, the plaintiff's claim
                            against the second to ninth defendants must be dismissed with
                            costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    In my view, the present case is eminently suitable
                            for an application under O 14 r 12 because a decision in
                            favour of the defendants <em>would have finally disposed
                                of the action</em> between them and the plaintiff. The
                            procedure could result in substantial savings of time and costs. Rule 12
                            would permit a full hearing, involving prolonged arguments on points of
                            law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Furthermore, Chao J’s observation
                    that O 14 r 12 could be used for determining standalone issues of law
                    seems to have been based solely on the authority of <em>Korso</em>. As observed at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                    above, <em>Korso</em> itself (consistent with <em>Payna</em>) was a case where the English Court of Appeal had
                    allowed the O 14A application because it in fact resulted in summary
                    judgment in favour of the plaintiffs, and as such determined the entire dispute
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Accordingly, notwithstanding
                    Chao J’s dicta that O 14 r 12 could be used to decide
                    standalone issues of law, the true ratio of <em>Payna</em>
                    is, as it appears to me, that its application is most appropriate when it would
                    have the effect of deciding the entire dispute between the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I turn now to the decision in <em>SM Summit</em>, which was the first case where the court
                    allowed O 14 r 12 to be used to determine the meaning of an allegedly
                    defamatory article even though such determination did not in fact dispose of the
                    entire action. The plaintiff in <em>SM Summit</em> had
                    brought a defamation action against the defendants for publishing an allegedly
                    defamatory press release at a press conference. Shortly after the commencement
                    of the action, the plaintiff applied for summary judgment seeking an order under
                    O 14 r 12 for determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the
                    alleged defamatory words. The Court of Appeal referred to <em>Payna</em> for the proposition that O 14 r 12 could be used
                    to determine the meaning of an article even though such determination did not
                    dispose of the entire action. Following that, it held that O 14 r 12
                    could be used to determine the meaning of the press release because the
                    plaintiff was not relying on any extrinsic evidence to prove the ordinary
                    meaning of the press release. It stated at [49] and [50] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    Leaving aside for the moment the argument on para
                                (<em>a</em>) of O 14 r 12(1), it is
                            clear from a plain reading of the words of O 14 r 12(1) itself
                            that that provision may be employed where the determination of a
                            question would "fully determine" the entire cause or matter or any claim
                            or any issue in the cause or matter…In our opinion, there is no
                            impediment to the application of O 14 r 12 in the present
                            case, as the determination of the meaning (or meanings) of the words
                            complained of would fully resolve the issue as to the meaning of the
                            words in the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    As for the argument that the meaning of the words
                            complained of is not "suitable for determination" without a full trial
                            of the action because such determination requires the hearing of
                            evidence, we find that such an argument is completely misplaced. The
                            plaintiffs claim that the words complained of in their natural and
                            ordinary meaning are defamatory of them. It is settled law that in
                            determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, no extrinsic
                            evidence is admissible to determine their meaning or the sense in which
                            they were understood: <em>Bank of China v Asiaweek
                                Ltd</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 230 at [13] and <em>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew</em> [1992]
                            1 SLR(R) 791 at [19]. A judge in determining this issue at
                            this stage stands in exactly the same position as the trial judge, when
                            what is relied on in this action is the natural and ordinary meaning of
                            the words said to be defamatory of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It is clear that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>SM Summit</em> had adopted Chao J’s
                    reasoning in <em>Payna</em> that O 14 r 12 can
                    indeed be used to determine an issue of law that did not finally determine the
                    entire dispute. This much is uncontroversial. It is also clear from <em>SM Summit</em> that the meaning of an allegedly defamatory
                    article is an issue that can be determined under O 14 r 12, if neither
                    the plaintiff nor the defendant is relying on extrinsic evidence to prove their
                    respective meanings of the article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However, it bears repeating that the procedure
                    under O 14 r 12 is discretionary in nature and this is clearly borne
                    out by the opening lines of O 14 r 12 itself <em>viz</em> “The Court may”. An analysis of the decision
                    in <em>SM Summit</em> would not be complete without
                    understanding its procedural history. When the O 14 r 12 application
                    was first made in <em>SM Summit</em>, the Assistant
                    Registrar determined the meaning of the press release but granted the defendants
                    unconditional leave to defend. The defendant then appealed to overturn the
                    Assistant Registrar’s determination of the meaning of the press release
                    but the plaintiff did not appeal against the decision granting unconditional
                    leave to defend. In the event, the High Court affirmed the Assistant
                    Registrar’s determination of the meaning of the press release. There was
                    no consideration whether summary judgment should be allowed as there was no
                    appeal by the plaintiff. Therefore when the matter came before the Court of
                    Appeal, the only live issue was whether the determination on meaning should be
                    upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Given the procedural history, the Court of
                    Appeal decided that it was perhaps best not to disturb the exercise of
                    procedural discretion by the courts below since reversing the decision would
                    have rendered the entire process a nullity. From the Court of Appeal’s
                    perspective, in upholding the Assistant Registrar’s determination on
                    meaning, it would in fact save costs and time for the parties in light of the
                    specific circumstances of that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Therefore, <em>SM
                        Summit</em> should not be taken as standing for the proposition that
                    O 14 r 12 can always be used in every defamation case to determine
                    meaning of the offending words irrespective of whether such determination would
                    lead to summary judgment. As VK Rajah JA pointed out in <em>Basil
                        Anthony</em> at [69], the Court of Appeal was very careful in
                        S<em>M Summit</em> in emphasizing (at [51])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our judgment, <em>in this case</em>, the natural
                        and ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory words is a question which is
                        suitable for determination under O 14 r 12(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Court of Appeal’s restrictive
                    interpretation of <em>SM Summit</em> in <em>Basil Anthony</em> is entirely in line with its general attitude
                    towards the bifurcation of the court process in dealing with issues of law and
                    fact, which is one of caution. In <em>Federal Insurance Co v
                        Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 982
                        (“<em>Federal Insurance”)</em>, the Court
                    of Appeal had the opportunity to lay down the circumstances in which it would be
                    appropriate to determine a preliminary issue of law under O 33 r 2
                    before trying the issues of fact. Chan Sek Keong J stated at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Taking all the points made by counsel for the appellants, we may state as
                        a general rule that the court will not exercise its power under O 33
                        r 2 to order a preliminary point of law to be tried, whether or not
                        that point involves the prior determination of factual disputes affecting
                        that point, unless the trial of that issue will result in a substantial
                        saving of time and expenditure in respect of the trial of the action as a
                        whole (including any counterclaim).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Court of Appeal reiterated its cautious
                    approach in <em>San International Pte Ltd v Keppel Engineering
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 447 (“<em>San International</em>”) where it stated at [30] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All too often counsel are eager to take short cuts by taking preliminary
                        points of law on inadequate agreed facts. This trend which is prevalent in
                        building contract disputes is not to be encouraged. As it has been seen in
                        this case it is counter productive and wasteful of time, expense and
                        effort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     After <em>SM Summit</em>,
                    a practice appeared to have developed in some defamation cases whereby the court
                    would grant determination of meaning under O 14 r 12 as long as the
                    parties were not relying on any extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of
                    the allegedly defamatory words irrespective whether such determination led to
                    summary judgment. Some of these applications resulted directly in summary
                    judgments for the plaintiffs, thus fulfilling the underlying purpose of
                    O 14 r 12, <em>ie</em> saving time and cost for
                    the parties: see <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</em>
                    [2003] 3 SLR(R) 8; <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em>
                    v <em>Singapore Democratic Party and others and another
                        suit</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 675; <em>Lee
                        Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd and another and another
                        suit</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 177. On the other hand, there
                    were some cases where the court made determination of meaning even though it was
                    clear that the cases would still have to proceed to trial due to triable issues
                    of fact. For example in Hytech <em>Builders Pte Ltd v Goh Teng
                        Poh Karen</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 236 <em>(“Hytech”</em>), the defendant had sent an email
                    containing an allegation that the plaintiff was on the verge of collapse. The
                    plaintiff then sued the defendant for defamation. The plaintiff applied, and
                    obtained an O 14 r 12 determination of the natural and ordinary
                    meaning of the offending words. As a result, when the matter came to trial, the
                    only issue to be dealt with by the trial judge was whether the defendant had
                    succeeded in establishing either of her pleaded defences of fair comment and
                    qualified privilege. There was no discussion in the decision how such a
                    determination would save time and cost for the parties. Similarly in <em>Basil Anthony</em>, the plaintiff had obtained an O 14
                    r 12 determination of the meaning of the words before the trial and more
                    significantly before a different judge even though it was clear that the
                    defendant had triable defences to the defamation suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The trend, as represented by cases like
                        <em>Hytech</em> and the High Court’s decision in
                        <em>Basil Anthony</em>, appeared to have supported the
                    use of O 14 r 12 to bifurcate a defamation suit whenever this can be
                    done. The assumption seems to be that such bifurcation would always lead to the
                    saving of time and cost for the parties. While I agree that O 14 r 12
                    can be used in such a manner, it is imperative to always bear in mind that the
                    proper use of O 14 r 12 is directed at saving cost and time in each
                    particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In my judgment, the question of whether
                    O 14 r 12 should be used to determine a free standing issue of law or
                    construction of a document cannot be divorced from its underlying purpose,
                    namely the saving of time and cost for the parties. More specifically, there
                    should not be any assumption that the use of O 14 r 12 will always be
                    cost and time efficient. This was precisely the approach taken by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Basil Anthony</em>, where VK Rajah JA stated
                    at [69] and [70] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    [A] segmented approach is not likely to be cost or
                            time efficient, both in terms of the time it takes for the case to be
                            steered through the various stages and the possibility of an appeal at
                            each stage …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70    [T]he plaintiff in a defamation action ought to
                            apply for an O 14 r 12 determination of the natural and
                            ordinary meaning of allegedly defamatory words/statements only where
                            there are clearly no triable defences (see, <em>eg, Bank
                                of Chia v Asiaweek</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 230;
                                <em>Chee Siok Chin and another v AG</em> [2006]
                            4 SLR(R) 541; <em>Review Publishing v
                                Lee</em> ([58] <em>supra</em>)).
                            Ordinarily, if there clearly are triable defences, the court should
                            refrain from giving an opinion on the natural and ordinary meaning of
                            the alleged defamatory words/statements concerned in the O 14
                            r 12 proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Accordingly, O 14 r 12 should be
                    used in defamation cases for determination on meaning in tandem with a
                    plaintiff’s application for summary judgment. If the court is satisfied
                    that there are triable defences, it should decline to make a ruling on meaning.
                    Any other interpretation is likely to lead to increase in cost, expense and time
                    which would run counter to the underlying purpose behind the introduction of
                    O 14 r 12. However, if it is more expedient to conduct the defamation
                    trial with meaning determined in advance of the examination of the witnesses,
                    such determination should be done by the trial judge under O 33 r 2.
                    In this way, it would ensure that the determination on meaning is not made by a
                    different judge which was one of the main objections observed in <em>Basil Anthony</em>. It leaves me now to deal with the
                    plaintiff’s application for summary judgment to see if there are triable
                    defences before deciding whether the determination of meaning of the Article by
                    the AR should be upheld. In any event, both parties agreed that this is the
                    correct approach to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The ordinary and natural meaning of the Article</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The main point of contention between the
                    parties was over the type of misconduct that the Article would convey to a
                    reasonable person reading it. Mr Tan claimed that the ordinary person
                    reading the Article would conclude that the plaintiff had received $3000 in cash
                    for herself in return for a guaranteed place at [B]SS. On the other hand,
                    Mr Palmer contended that the ordinary person reading the Article would only
                    conclude that the plaintiff had solicited $3000 in cash as a donation for [B]SS
                    in return for a guaranteed place at [B]SS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Tan advanced two arguments as to why a
                    reasonable person reading the Article would have understood it as meaning that
                    the plaintiff had demanded $3000 in cash for herself in return for a guaranteed
                    place at [B]SS. First, the phrase “cash ah, no cheques” at
                    paragraph three of the Article conveyed the impression that the plaintiff did
                    not want to leave a paper trail because she knew she was doing something wrong.
                    Since it is well known that schools do take donations made in cheque, the only
                    possible inference that a reasonable person would make of this was the plaintiff
                    intended to keep the money for herself and hence she did not want to leave any
                    paper trail. Second, the phrase “MOE didn’t refer her to
                    CPIB” suggests that the plaintiff was corrupt because she took bribes for
                    herself, and that this was something that the Corrupt Practices Investigation
                    Bureau (“CPIB”) should have investigated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     On the other hand, Mr Palmer responded
                    with two principal arguments to explain why a reasonable person reading the
                    Article would regard it as meaning that the plaintiff had solicited $3000 in
                    cash as donation for [B]SS in return for a guaranteed place at [B]SS. First, the
                    exact words used in the Article were that “[ANB] demanded $3000 cash
                    for each student in donation.” There was no indication that the defendant
                    had used the word “donation” in a sarcastic or cryptic manner such
                    that a reasonable person would regard it as a euphemism for a personal bribe,
                    for example if the word donation was placed within inverted commas or italicised
                    or in bold for effect. Coupled with the fact that the word “bribe”
                    was not used even once in the Article, it was wrong to assume that a reasonable
                    person would regard the Article as meaning that the plaintiff had taken a
                    personal bribe for herself. Secondly, the phrase “the things an educator
                    will do for performance bonus” in the last paragraph of the Article made
                    it very clear that whatever wrongdoing the defendant had accused the plaintiff
                    of committing was done in the hope that this would give her a high performance
                    bonus. It was therefore entirely illogical for a reasonable reader to suppose
                    that the plaintiff would get a higher performance bonus from the school by
                    taking personal bribes surreptitiously for herself. Hence, the only way in which
                    the Article could be reconciled with this phrase would be to read it to mean
                    that the plaintiff had demanded $3000 in cash donations for [B]SS in exchange
                    for a guaranteed place, and that she had done it in the hope that her
                    achievement in securing more donations for [B]SS would earn her a higher
                    performance bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     After considering the parties’
                    respective arguments, I arrived at the conclusion that it was more probable that
                    a reasonable person would read the Article as meaning that the plaintiff had
                    demanded $3000 in cash donations on behalf of [B]SS. Although the
                    Article’s portrayal of the plaintiff’s demands on payment in cash
                    could suggest an inference that she did not want to leave a paper trail, this
                    was not the only legitimate inference that could be drawn. A reasonable reader
                    could also infer that the plaintiff’s demand to be paid in cash was
                    motivated by the concern that the cheque could possibly be dishonoured, and by
                    then it would be too late to retract her offer of a guaranteed place in [B]SS.
                    As for the reference to CPIB, this did not necessarily refer to personal
                    corruption on the plaintiff’s part. It could just as well refer to the
                    plaintiff’s conduct of “<em>selling</em>” guaranteed places in [B]SS in return for $3000
                    donations to [B]SS. In this regard, there is no dispute that it is the clear
                    policy of the Ministry of Education that schools are not permitted to solicit
                    donations in exchange for school places. At this point, it is important to
                    remember that the ordinary reasonable reader is “not unduly suspicious or
                    avid for scandal” (<em>SM Summit</em> at [53]), and
                    neither does he “select one bad meaning where other non-defamatory
                    meanings are available”: see <em>Skuse v Granada
                        Television Ltd</em> [1996] EMLR 278 at 285
                        (“<em>Skuse</em>”). In the same vein, it
                    would be overly cynical to assume that a reasonable reader would always read the
                    Article in a way that portrayed the plaintiff in the worst possible light
                        (<em>ie</em> taking personal bribes for herself) when a
                    reasonable alternative interpretation (<em>ie</em>
                    improperly soliciting donations for [B]SS) exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Furthermore, I agree with Mr Palmer that
                    the reference to “performance bonus” in the Article was
                    inconsistent with the plaintiff’s contended meaning of the Article.
                    Although Mr Tan attempted to play down this inconsistency by suggesting
                    that it was completely disconnected with the rest of the Article and that it
                    made no reference to the plaintiff, I found his argument on this point to be
                    tenuous. In my opinion, although the reasonable reader is not blessed with the
                    analytical attention of a lawyer (<em>Skuse</em> at 285),
                    he or she is certainly able to select an interpretation of an article that makes
                    the most logical sense as a whole. It is clear from the context that the
                    reference to “an educator” in the singular could only refer to the
                    plaintiff. Further, the sensible way in which the Article can be reconciled with
                    the reference to performance bonus is by reading it to mean that the plaintiff
                    had demanded $3000 in cash for [B]SS. Even if a reasonable reader had, after
                    reading the initial part of the Article, formed an initial impression that the
                    plaintiff had taken personal bribes, he would likely revise his views upon
                    noticing the logical inconsistency between that initial impression and the
                    reference to the performance bonus at the end of the Article. In legal terms,
                    the reference to the performance bonus is the “antidote” that
                    counters the “bane” (the impression that the plaintiff had taken
                    personal bribes).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For the above reasons, I find that the Article
                    meant and was understood to mean that the plaintiff was sacked as a teacher,
                    because she had demanded $3000 in cash donations for [B]SS from the guardians of
                    foreign students applying for places in [B]SS. These donations were made to
                    guarantee acceptance of these foreign students into [B]SS regardless of their
                    results in the placement test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence of justification </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It was common ground between the parties that
                    the Article was defamatory (regardless of whether it had the meaning contended
                    by the plaintiff or the defendant), and that the plaintiff was entitled to
                    summary judgment unless the defendant could show the existence of a triable
                    defence of justification. Mr Palmer further conceded that if the meaning of
                    the Article was similar to the one advanced by the plaintiff, the defendant
                    would have no triable defence based on justification and that the plaintiff
                    would therefore be entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly,
                    Mr Palmer’s submissions on justification were advanced with reference
                    to the meaning contended by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There was no dispute between the parties on
                    the law relating to the defence of justification. The defendant would succeed in
                    proving the defence if she is able to prove that the main gist of the defamatory
                    statement is true. There is no need for her to justify statements or comments
                    which do not add to the <em>sting</em> of the charge. This
                    was so held by the Court of Appeal in <em>Aaron Anne Joseph and
                        others v Cheong Yip Seng and others</em>
                    [1996] 1 SLR(R) 258 at [73]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that the parts of the article which the
                        respondents have not pleaded and justified were Van Leen's comments that the
                        control exercised by a leader of a sect could be dangerous, that it could
                        lead to a tragedy like the Jonestown incident, and that if things were to go
                        wrong the lives of the leader and the members could be at risk. Such
                        statements of Van Leen were no more than a warning of the extreme results
                        which could ensue. But the substance or gist of the libel contained in the
                        article has been proved, <em>ie</em> the nature and
                        extent of the control exercised by the first appellant over the members of
                        the House of Israel resulting in their loss of self-will and dignity.

                        in para 361 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>Substantial justification sufficient</b>. It
                            is not necessary to prove the truth of every word of the libel. If the
                            defendant proves that 'the main charge, or gist, of the libel' is true,
                            he need not justify statements or comments which do not add to the sting
                            of the charge or introduce any matter by itself actionable. 'It is
                            sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be justified; it
                            is unnecessary to repeat every word which might have been the subject of
                            the original comment. As much must be justified as meets the sting of
                            the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not add
                            to the sting of it, that need not be justified' (per Burrough J in
                                <em>Edwards v Bell</em> (1824) 1 Bing 403 at p
                            409).”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The defence of justification was based on four
                    alleged incidents where the plaintiff was said to have offered guaranteed places
                    in [B]SS to students who had failed the placement tests in return for $3000 cash
                    donations to [B]SS:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first incident concerned a
                        student of the defendant called [CD]. According to the defendant, the
                        plaintiff informed her that [CD] had performed badly in the English
                        component of the placement test. The plaintiff further requested a cash
                        donation of $3000 to the [B]SS school committee fund as a prior condition
                        for admission into [B]SS. Although [CD] initially agreed to make the $3000
                        donation, he eventually did not do so after a dispute with the plaintiff. In
                        the event, [CD] was not admitted to [B]SS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second and third incidents related to two
                        foreign students, [EF] and [GH], who were under the charge of the
                        defendant’s husband. Both students had failed the [B]SS placement test
                        and had been informed by the plaintiff that they had to make a cash donation
                        of $3000 to the [B]SS school committee fund as a prior condition for their
                        admission. In both cases, the defendant’s husband pleaded with the
                        plaintiff to accept cheque donations instead, and they were eventually
                        accepted by the plaintiff. Thereafter both [EF] and [GH] were accepted into
                        [B]SS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        final incident concerned another foreign student named [IJ] who was tutored
                        by the defendant. [M] was [IJ]’s guardian. Before
                        [IJ] sat for the [B]SS placement test, he came to the defendant’s
                        house with a copy of the [B]SS English Test Paper 1 and asked the defendant
                        for assistance. Subsequently, [IJ] informed the defendant that the English
                        placement test which he sat for at [B]SS was the same English Test Paper 1
                        which [M] had provided to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr Palmer claimed that the first, second
                    and third incidents showed that for $3000, the plaintiff secured places in [B]SS
                    for students who had failed their placement tests. This justified the
                    defendant’s allegation against the plaintiff that she had in fact
                    solicited cash donations in exchange for guaranteed places in [B]SS. In
                    addition, the fourth incident showed that the plaintiff had leaked out the [B]SS
                    test papers to the students of selected guardians.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In response, Mr Tan submitted that there
                    was no admissible evidence that the incidents had taken place as alleged.
                    Furthermore, he proffered three main reasons why they did not afford a defence
                    of justification even if the incidents did occur. First, in relation to the
                    fourth incident, Mr Tan pointed out that there was no link whatsoever to
                    the plaintiff since the defendant had not even alleged the plaintiff was the one
                    who had leaked the test papers to [IJ]. Second, the defendant’s own
                    version of the first, second and third incidents revealed that no cash donations
                    were in fact received by the plaintiff on behalf of [B]SS. At the very most,
                    they only showed that the plaintiff had, on behalf of [B]SS, received cheque
                    donations from the defendant’s husband. This was to be contrasted with the
                    defendant’s pleaded meaning of the Article that the plaintiff had accepted
                    cash donations. Finally, Mr Tan pointed out that the defendant’s
                    particulars of justification dealt only with the plaintiff’s alleged acts
                    of accepting <em>cash</em> donations from the guardians of
                    foreign students, and was conspicuously silent on the defendant’s comments
                    that the plaintiff had been sacked for her improper actions. Since an allegation
                    that someone has been sacked is defamatory if that is not true, the plaintiff
                    was entitled to summary judgment on this point alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I agree with Mr Tan that the final
                    incident relied on by the defendant was irrelevant since it did not even purport
                    to identify the plaintiff as the one who had leaked the test papers to [IJ] or
                    to [M]. However, I did not agree with his argument that the
                    second and third incidents were irrelevant to the defence of justification
                    merely because, on the defendant’s own version of events, the plaintiff
                    had accepted cheque donations to [B]SS instead of cash donations as alleged. It
                    is pertinent to point out that the plaintiff has not denied that both [EF] and
                    [GH] were accepted by [B]SS in spite of failing the placement tests. Further,
                    there was likewise no denial by the plaintiff that donations, albeit by cheques,
                    were accepted by [B]SS from [EF] and [GH] through their guardian. In my opinion,
                    the sting of the Article lay in the allegation that the plaintiff had demanded
                    $3000 in donations from guardians of foreign students in return for guaranteed
                    places in [B]SS even though the students had failed the placement tests. The
                    second and third incidents clearly met the sting of the Article since they show
                    (if proved to be true at the trial) that the plaintiff did demand $3000 in cash
                    donations to [B]SS from the defendant’s husband, though she was eventually
                    persuaded to accept donations by cheques instead. It showed that [EF] and [GH]
                    were thereafter accepted into [B]SS after cheque donations were made, despite
                    failing the placement tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     However, the defendant’s defence of
                    justification did not attempt to justify the allegation that the plaintiff had
                    been sacked from her job because of her improper actions. Mr Tan was
                    clearly correct in pointing out that an allegation that someone has been sacked
                    from her job is defamatory since it connotes either incompetence or wrongdoing
                    on the person’s part. However, in a case where the allegation of sacking
                    is merely one of a few allegations in a defamatory article, and the defendant is
                    able to justify the other allegations, the inability to justify the allegation
                    of sacking does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the
                    defence of justification fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In this regard, there are a number of English
                    cases which held that the defence of justification may succeed notwithstanding
                    the fact that the defendant is unable to justify all the defamatory allegations
                    made against the plaintiff. These cases followed a similar script whereby the
                    plaintiff would sue the defendant for defamation only in respect of some of the
                    allegations contained in a single defamatory statement. When the defendant tries
                    to justify some of the allegations not complained of by the plaintiff, the
                    plaintiff would then apply to strike out those justifications as being
                    irrelevant to the defamation that is complained off: see <em>S and K Holdings Ltd v Throgmorton Publications Ltd and
                        another</em> [1972] 1 WLR 1036 <em>(“Throgmorton”)</em> and <em>Polly Peck
                        (Holdings) Plc and Others v Trelford and Others</em>
                    [1986] QB 1000. The judicial response to this approach is to examine
                    the defamatory material in its entirety to determine if it contained a common
                    sting. If the separate allegations in the defamatory had a common sting, then
                    the defendant may succeed on his defence of justification by proving the truth
                    of the sting, notwithstanding his failure to prove each of the specific
                    allegations complained of by the plaintiff. This is the case even if the common
                    sting does not involve a general allegation of wrongdoing. In <em>Carlton Communications Plc v News Group Newspapers Ltd</em>
                    [2002] EMLR 16, Simon Brown LJ explained the operation of this
                    principle (at [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I understand Mr Milmo's argument, it is that a second allegation
                        cannot properly be introduced for the purposes of justification under the
                        common sting principle unless, taken together, the allegations can be said
                        to advance a wholly general charge — in Khashoggi of promiscuity, here
                        of fakery. That argument, to my mind, unnecessarily glosses the authorities
                        and would too narrowly circumscribe the scope of the substantive defence of
                        justification. It would, for example, prevent a defendant who alleged of a
                        claimant that he had committed three murders, in the event that the claimant
                        chose to sue only in respect of one, relying by way of justification on the
                        other two. Mr Milmo would, I think, submit that nothing short of an
                        allegation that the claimant is a serial killer could found a defence on
                        this basis. I would reject the argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The reasoning of the English courts on this issue cannot be
                    faulted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the present case, the plaintiff had
                    complained of two allegations in the Article, namely, that she had requested
                    $3000 in donations for [B]SS in return for a guaranteed place; and that she had
                    been sacked. Although these two allegations were seemingly separate, in my view,
                    an ordinary reasonable person who read the Article would conclude that the
                    plaintiff had been sacked <em>because</em> of her improper
                    conduct in obtaining donations by guaranteeing places in [B]SS to students
                    regardless of the placement test results. The sacking of the plaintiff was the
                    mere consequence of such misconduct, and did not constitute an independent smear
                    on her competence or character. The common sting behind the two allegations
                    remained the same: that the plaintiff had acted improperly by requesting $3000
                    in donation for [B]SS in return for a guaranteed place in the
                school.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The mere fact that the two allegations
                    contained a common sting did not, however, mean that the defendant was freed of
                    the need to justify the allegation of sacking. There are varying degrees of
                    misconduct, and it would be anomalous if a defendant who alleged a plaintiff of
                    gross misconduct could escape liability merely by justifying a lower level of
                    misconduct on the plaintiff’s part. In this respect, reference should be
                    made to the case of <em>Weaver v Lloyd</em> (1824)
                    2 B&amp;C 678, where the defendant had charged the plaintiff with
                    various acts of cruelty to a house, including, amongst other acts, knocking out
                    one of the horse’s eyes. He was able to justify all the acts of cruelty
                    charged except the part about knocking out the horse’s eyes. The court
                    held that the defendant was liable because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The statement that he knocked out the horse’s eye imputed a much
                        greater of cruelty than a charge of beating him on other parts of the body.
                        If we were to hold this a sufficient justification, exaggerated accounts of
                        any transaction might always be given with impunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Accordingly, the question is whether the
                    Article would be any less damaging to the plaintiff if the portion concerning
                    the plaintiff’s sacking was deleted from it. I considered the answer to be
                    possibly yes, not because the sacking connoted a higher degree of moral
                    shortcoming on the plaintiff’s part, but rather because the fact of
                    sacking might, in the eyes of some readers, provide some independent
                    verification that the plaintiff had indeed committed the improper acts that the
                    defendant had accused her of committing. In other words, the allegation of
                    sacking had the effect of increasing the veracity of the defendant’s
                    allegation that the plaintiff had requested $3000 in donations for [B]SS in
                    return for a guaranteed place in the school. This, however, is very different
                    from saying that the allegation of sacking made the Article more defamatory than
                    it would have been otherwise. Furthermore, the question of veracity becomes
                    largely irrelevant when the defence is based on justification, since the defence
                    requires the defendant to establish the truth of the allegations in any
                    event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     For the above reasons, I hold that the
                    defendant has raised a triable defence of justification and the plaintiff is
                    therefore not entitled to summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In the light of my findings, I made the
                    following orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant is therefore granted unconditional
                            leave to defend; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Consequently, I allow the defendant’s
                            appeal against the AR’s determination on meaning of the
                            Article.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     For avoidance of any doubt, my finding on the
                    meaning of the Article at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> above was
                    specifically for the purpose of arriving at my decision that the defence of
                    justification is triable, and therefore should the matter proceed to trial, my
                    determination on meaning of the Article would not bind the trial
                judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Finally, as regards costs, given the unusual
                    route which this appeal has taken as well as the interposition of the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>Basil Anthony</em> after the
                    appeal was first heard by me, it is only fair to both parties that costs of the
                    appeal and the hearing below should be costs in the cause and I so
                order.</p>
