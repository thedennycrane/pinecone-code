<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The accused faced two charges of rape that he</p>
<blockquote>
<u>
<p align="justify">1<sup>st</sup> Charge</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">sometime on the 19<sup>th</sup> day of December 1999, at or about 3 am, at Blk

  359 Yung An Road #08-87, Singapore, did commit rape on (the complainant), a female then of 18

  years of age  and (he had) thereby committed an offence punishable under section 376(1) of the

  Penal Code, Chapter 224</p>
<p align="justify">and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u>
<p align="justify">2<sup>nd</sup> Charge</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">sometime on the 19<sup>th</sup> day of December 1999, at or about 3 am, on a

  second occasion, at Blk 359 Yung An Road #08-87, Singapore, did commit rape on (the complainant),

  a female then of 18 years of age  and (he had) thereby committed an offence punishable under

  section 376(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. The accused and the complainant had known one another for less than three

weeks, having met on 1 December 1999 at the Sole Luna pub at Holland Village. The complainant who is

known as Annie, was a part-time waitress there. The accused was 23 years old and was a Second

Sergeant with the Singapore Armed Forces. He was smitten by her and was courting her assiduously

although she was not interested in him. They had one uneventful date on 10 December.</p>
<p align="justify">3. On 18 December the accused invited the complainant to a farewell party at the

Sole Luna for his friend Frankie. She accepted his invitation and arrived there at about 10.10 pm.

The accused and some of his friends were there, but Frankie was at another pub, the Sultan of Swing,

at Central Mall. The accused and his friends went to join Frankie at the Sultan of Swing at about 11

pm while the complainant remained at the Sole Luna. She was still there when the accused returned

from the Sultan of Swing at about midnight.</p>
<p align="justify">4. She had about six bourbon cokes and vodka limes and they had their effect on

her. She was resting her head on the bar counter, crying. At around 2 am, the Sole Lunas closing

time, the complainants friends and colleagues were leaving the pub. The complainant was assisted

by the accused and his friends on her way out of the pub. They got her into a car, but she got out,

vomited and declared that she did not want to be taken home. The accuseds friends carried her

into another car. They went through her hand bag and found that she stayed at Jalan Bahagia. They

also telephoned her home and informed her brother that they were sending her home. However as the

complainant maintained that she did not want to go home, they took her to the accuseds home at

Yung An Road on his suggestion.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The complainant was asleep on the way there. When they reached the block where

the accused stayed, she was carried to the void deck where she rested for a while as she wanted to

vomit. After that she was carried to the lift, and when they reached the floor the accused resided,

they stopped once more because the complainant wanted to vomit again.<sup></sup></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The events in the apartment</p>
<p align="justify">The complainants account</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">6. The complainant described the events in her conditional statement which was

admitted in evidence at the trial. She remembered being carried into the apartment and onto a bed

and dozing off. She was asleep until the sound of her pager woke her. She checked her pager and

noticed that there was a message for her. She borrowed the accuseds mobile phone, accessed her

voice mail and went back to sleep. She could not remember anything about the message except that it

was recorded at 3.17 am.</p>
<p align="justify">7. She was awaken again when she felt the accused touching her private parts. He

proceeded to remove her skirt and panties and inserted his penis and moved it in and out of her

vagina. When she gave him a push, he got up and put on her skirt and panties. She got up from the

bed feeling giddy and nauseated. She went to the toilet to vomit, then returned to the bed and lied

down again as she was still very giddy.</p>
<p align="justify">8. After a short while the accused removed her skirt and panties and inserted his

penis into her vagina again. He tried to kiss her, but she turned her head away. She pushed him off,

but he climbed back on her body and penetrated her again. When he eventually stopped, she felt

something wet and fluid outside her vagina. He then put on her skirt and panties for her again.</p>
<p align="justify">9. She got up, went to the toilet and washed her face. She then returned to the

bedroom and told the accused she wanted to go home. She left the apartment and went home.</p>
<p align="justify">10. She did not sleep when she returned home because she was frightened by the

events. At about 9 am she changed her clothes and went to the market with her aunt. When they

returned from the market at about 9.30 am, she washed the clothes and panties she wore previously

and took a bath.</p>
<p align="justify">11. Later that day she spoke to several persons on the telephone and recounted

the events at the accuseds apartment and sought their advice. They were Kristine Chia Meng Moy,

Jean Woon Teng Teng and Denise Ho Shu Ying, her former schoolmates, Daniel Sin Fu Wei, a colleague

at Sole Luna, and Max Chua Wee Hua, who is referred to as her god-brother. Each of them confirmed

that the complainant had told them of her experience. Denise Ho and Max Chua were with the

complainant when she made her police report that afternoon.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The accuseds account</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">12. The accused gave three different accounts of his sexual intercourse with the

complainant. They were firstly, his investigation statement of December 1999, secondly, his further

statement of 31 May 2000 and thirdly, his statement at the trial tendered under s 371 of the

Criminal Procedure Code.</p>
<p align="justify">13. In the investigation statement of 31 December 1999 which was admitted in

evidence without objection he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I then lie down on the bed beside Annie with the intention to sleep. I had the

  urge to have sex with Annie and I started to kiss Annie on her lips. She responded and kissed me

  back. I then started to lift up the spaghetti strap shirt that she was wearing and removed the

  shirt. I then pulled down her skirt. I then unhooked her bra and then I removed her panty. All the

  while when I was removing her shirt, skirt, bra and panty, she also assisted me by lifting up her

  arms and buttock. When Annie was naked, I then started to remove my T-shirt, shorts and underwear.

  I then lie on top of Annie and I spread open Annies leg and I inserted my penis into her

  vagina. I then thrusted my penis in and out of her vagina. She lain on the bed without any

  movement of her body or limbs but she was groaning. <i>About 15 minutes later, Annie lifted her

  hands and pushed me on my shoulders so I got up from Annie.</i> She did not say anything when she

  pushed me and her eyes were closed. I then put on her bra, panty, her shirt and then her skirt for

  Annie. I then put on my underwear and shorts. I then went out of my room to the kitchen to drink

  some water. I did not close my bedroom door. After I drank, I went back to my bedroom and closed

  the bedroom door. I went back to the bed to sleep. Just as I laid down on the bed, the alarm clock

  sounded and it was 6 am. I got up from bed and woke Annie up. Annie opened her eyes and asked me

  for a cup of warm water. I then went out of my room to get a cup of warm water from the kitchen

  and then I went back to the bedroom with the water and gave the water to Annie. She sat up on the

  bed and drank the water. After drinking about half the cup, Annie passed the cup back to me. She

  then got up from the bed, took her bag which was placed on my study table and asked me to open the

  main door for her as she wanted to go back home. (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. Several questions were put to him by the investigation and recording officer

ASP Amy Ting -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q5) Before you started to have sex with Annie, did you at any time ask Annies

  permission to have sex with her?</p>
<p align="justify">A5) Yes when I laid down on the bed beside her and before I started kissing

  her, I asked her whether I can have sex with her.</p>
<p align="justify">Q6) What was Annies response when you asked her for sex?</p>
<p align="justify">A6) She was mumbling something but I cannot make out what she said.</p>
<p align="justify">Q7) What gave you the impression that she had agreed to have sex with you?</p>
<p align="justify">A7) I thought she was mumbling was yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q8) If Annie had agreed to have sex with you, why do you think that she pushed

  you away?</p>
<p align="justify">A8) <i>She does not want to have sex but I let go when she pushed me</i>.

  (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15. On 31 May 2000 after taking a lie detector test he presented himself to ASP

Ting. This statement was also admitted in evidence without objection.</p>
<p align="justify">16. I set out the more significant parts of the statement -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q8) Is there anything you want to tell me now which you had omitted in your

  previous statements?</p>
<p align="justify">A8) I took advantage of Annie.</p>
<p align="justify">Q9) When did you take advantage of Annie?</p>
<p align="justify">A9) On 18 December 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">Q10) Where did you take advantage of Annie?</p>
<p align="justify">A10) At my house.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Q12) Why did you say that you had taken advantage of Annie by having sex with

  her?</p>
<p align="justify">A12) It was impulse and without her consents.</p>
<p align="justify">Q13) Why do you say that you had sex with Annie without her consent?</p>
<p align="justify">A13) Because I acted on impulse.</p>
<p align="justify">Q14) Did Annie at anytime agree to have sex with you that night?</p>
<p align="justify">A14) No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q15) Did you at anytime ask Annie whether you can have sex with her that night?</p>
<p align="justify">A15) No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q16) Since you did not ask Annie whether you could have sex with her and she

  did not at anytime agree to have sex with you that night, why did you still engage in sexual

  intercourse with Annie?</p>
<p align="justify">A16) I had the urge to have sex.</p>
<p align="justify">Q17) Did Annie respond to you physically or verbally when you had sex with her

  that night?</p>
<p align="justify">A17) She was groaning.</p>
<p align="justify">Q18) In your further statement recorded on 31.12.99 in A5, you stated that when

  you laid down on the bed beside Annie and before you started kissing her, you had asked her

  whether you can have sex with her. However, just now at A15, you had stated that you did not at

  anytime asked Annie whether you can have sex with her that night. Can you explain which is the

  correct version?</p>
<p align="justify">A18) <i>The correct version is that I did not ask her for permission to have

  sex with her.</i></p>
<p align="justify">Q19) Since you did not ask Annie for permission to have sex with her, why did

  you state in your further statement recorded on 31.12.99 that you had asked Annie for her

  permission to have sex with her?</p>
<p align="justify">A19) After going through the Lie-detector test, the examiner spoke to me and

  asked me to tell the truth. So I told him the truth that I had the urge to have sex with Annie and

  I did not ask her for permission.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Q24) <i>That night in your house, do you think that Annie had allowed you to

  have sex with her that night?</i></p>
<p align="justify">A24) <i>Not sure.</i></p>
<p align="justify">Q25) Since you are not sure, that night, whether Annie allowed you to have sex

  with her, what made you go ahead to have sex with her?</p>
<p align="justify">A25) I just had the urge to have sex with her.</p>
<p align="justify">Q26) In A12 just now, you had stated that you had taken advantage of Annie by

  having sex with Annie on impulse and without her consents. Why did you say that Annie did not

  consent to the sex?</p>
<p align="justify">A26) Because after going through the lie detector test, I decided to tell you

  the truth.</p>
<p align="justify">Q27) So what is the truth now?</p>
<p align="justify">A27) <i>I had sex without Annies consent.</i></p>
<p align="justify">Q28) Why didnt you tell me when I first recorded your statement on 31.12.99?</p>
<p align="justify">A28) I just wanted to go home that time.</p>
<p align="justify">Q29) Since Annie did not consent to have sex with you, what made you think that

  Annie would allow you to have sex with her?</p>
<p align="justify">A29) I dont know.</p>
<p align="justify">Q30) <i>Did Annie do anything to indicate that she allowed you to have sex with

  her?</i></p>
<p align="justify">A30) <i>No.</i></p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">17. In his statement tendered in his defence he described the events thus</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">37. Annie was still sleeping on the bed. As I entered the room, Annie got up

  from the bed and stood up and said that she wanted to vomit. So I followed her out of the room and

  she walked by herself to the kitchen toilet.</p>
<p align="justify">38. She vomited in the toilet. Just at this moment my sister (Lina Chang Ying

  Siew) woke up and came out of her room, which was next to my room.</p>
<p align="justify">39. She asked me why I was opening and closing the door so loudly. At that time

  Annie was in the toilet. I told my sister to go back to sleep. My sister went back to her room.</p>
<p align="justify">40. After Annie finished vomiting, I followed her back to my bedroom. I placed

  her on the bed. At this moment Annies pager sounded. I took her pager, which was on my study

  table and gave it to her.</p>
<p align="justify">41. After looking at her pager, she asked for a phone and I gave her my

  handphone. She called someone and she spoke to someone by the name Kelvin. Then she hung and gave

  me back the phone and went back to sleep on my bed.</p>
<p align="justify">45. I then lay down on the bed beside Annie, intending to sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">46. I remember I fell asleep for a short while.</p>
<p align="justify">47. When I woke up, I had the urge to have sex with Annie.</p>
<p align="justify">48. I started to kiss Annie on the lips. She responded and kissed me back. She

  put her tongue in my mouth, and I put my tongue in her mouth.</p>
<p align="justify">49. I then started to lift the spaghetti strap blouse that she was wearing and

  removed the blouse.</p>
<p align="justify">50. I then pulled down her skirt.</p>
<p align="justify">51. I then unhooked her bra (it was a back-fastening bra) and I removed her

  panties.</p>
<p align="justify">52. All the while when I was removing her blouse, skirt, bra and panties, she

  also assisted me by lifting up her arms and buttocks.</p>
<p align="justify">53. When Annie was naked, I then started to remove my T-shirt, shorts and

  underwear.</p>
<p align="justify">54. Then, I lay on top of Annie and I spread open Annies legs and I inserted

  my penis into her vagina.</p>
<font size="3">
<p align="justify"> </p>
</font>
<p align="justify">55. I had no difficulty penetrating her. She was lubricated in her vagina.</p>
<p align="justify">56. Then I thrust my penis in and out of her vagina.</p>
<p align="justify">57. When I was thrusting my penis in and out of her vagina, both her hands were

  holding onto my arms. Apart from this, she just lay on the bed without any movement of her body or

  limbs, but she was groaning.</p>
<p align="justify">58. We stopped having sex because I could not maintain my erection. I did not

  ejaculate in her or outside her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">18. He referred to his statement of 31 December and retracted that part where he

had said that the complainant pushed him off while he was having sex with her. His explanation was

that he made the statement so that he would complete the statement and go home earlier lest ASP Ting

would question him in a threatening manner. This has to be considered against his acceptance that

this statement was a voluntary statement and against the fact that it was never put to ASP Ting that

she was impatient or threatening towards him during the recording of his statements.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Evaluation of the evidence</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">19. There was no dispute that sexual intercourse took place. The accused conceded

that he did not obtain the complainants oral consent for that. The defence that can be deduced

from his last statement (which I shall refer to as his s 371 statement) was that she had consented

by conduct by responding to his kiss and raising her arms and buttocks when he undressed her.</p>
<p align="justify">20. There were difficulties with the defence. There was the contrary account in

the statement of 31 May 2000 which was recorded on his initiative.</p>
<p align="justify">21. The May statement was made five months after the rape investigations against

him commenced. He was aware that the investigations were ongoing as he was required to go for a lie

detector test. He went back to ASP Ting after the test and told her that he wanted to make a further

statement. Then he told her that he had sex with the complainant on an impulse without seeking or

obtaining her consent, and further that she had not done anything to indicate that she allowed him

to have sex with her. In the statement he confirmed that it was voluntarily, and he was not

threatened or assaulted, that no promise had been made to him, that he chose to speak in a mixture

of English and Mandarin during the recording, and that he understood the investigation officer fully

during the recording.</p>
<p align="justify">22. When his counsel brought him through the statement, he elaborated that he had

taken advantage of the complainant because she was upset and she was vulnerable.</p>
<p align="justify">23. After revising the account given in December 1999 with the May statement, the

accused gave a third version of the events in s 371 statement.</p>
<p align="justify">24. When counsel went into the issue of consent with him, he explained that when

he referred to consent in the May statement, he meant verbal consent as he was under the impression

that rape was sex without verbal consent.</p>
<p align="justify">25. I did not accept the explanation. The accused was 23 years old. He had

obtained his N level certificate as well as a Certificate on Office Skills from the Institute of

Technical Education and was serving as a Second Sergeant in the Singapore Armed Forces. Having

observed him, and taking into account his background, I found that it was not credible that he

thought that consensual sex is sex with oral consent, and that without it, it is rape however

willing the partner may be. In any event, he went beyond verbal consent in the statement, and

confirmed that there was also no consent by conduct.</p>
<p align="justify">26. It must be remembered that the statement of 31 May was made entirely on the

accuseds initiative. Neither the officer who conducted the lie detector test nor ASP Ting

requested him to make the statement. He told the former that he wanted to see the latter, and he

went to see ASP Ting because in his own words, he decided to tell the truth and make changes to his

earlier statements.</p>
<p align="justify">27. When I considered the complainants evidence, it was clear that she had had

too much to drink. She was unhappy and was crying, and did not want to be sent home because she did

not want her parents to know she was drunk. She was vomiting intermittently and feeling nauseated,

and even after arriving at the accuseds apartment she had to get up from the bed to go to the

toilet to vomit again returning to the bed to sleep. When her sleep was interrupted by her pager,

she went back to sleep after accessing her voice mail.</p>
<p align="justify">28. The complainant could not be in an amorous state in that condition. Her

evidence that she had not consented to have sex with the accused was confirmed by the accused

himself. Her calls to her friends recounting the events corroborated her evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">29. I invited defence counsel to suggest a reason for the complainant to cry rape

if she had consented (the accused did not offer any explanation himself). Counsels response was

that the burden was not on the defence to deal with that. While he was correct that there was no

duty on the defence, it would have helped the defence if a persuasive reason was offered. To his

credit, counsel tried to assist, submitting that it is very hard to attribute motives and that

"(w)e can only go by a persons conduct and by a simple account of what happened. Thats

all we have. When it comes to motives we are really, really hard put."</p>
<p align="justify">30. In the closing submissions counsel complained of shortcomings in the

recording of the accuseds statements. The accused made his statements in a mixture of English and

Mandarin and ASP Ting could not recall the Mandarin expressions used which were recorded as

"consent", "agree", "allow" and "permission".</p>
<p align="justify">31. Nothing really turned on this. ASP Tings knowledge of Mandarin was not

questioned as she majored in Chinese Studies at the university. The statements themselves were

recorded in simple language, and the accused had not alleged that anything he said was omitted, or

that what was recorded did not emanate from him or was wrongly recorded. What was recorded was

simple and clear  that she did not give verbal consent or do anything which indicated consent.</p>
<p align="justify">32. Counsel also referred to the complainants ability to access her voice mail

and the calls that she was alleged to have made from the mobile phone reflected her actual condition

that morning.</p>
<p align="justify">33. The complainants use of her pager and the mobile phone fit in the overall

picture of her state in the apartment. It was not the prosecutions case that she was totally

physically or mentally disabled. The evidence was that she could go to the toilet to vomit, she was

aware of the accuseds advances, she resisted him to a point by turning her head to avoid his

kisses and by pushing him. Her ability to use the pager and the mobile phone was not exceptional in

the circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">34. After reviewing the evidence, I found that the prosecution had proved its

case against the accused on both charges and that he had not raised any doubt that he had sex with

the complainant without her consent in any form.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Sentence</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">35. In the commission of the offences, there was no violence, threat of violence,

abduction or wrongful confinement. There was also no preconceived plot by the accused. He could not

have known that the complainant would be drunk, or that she would not want to be sent back to her

own home. The offences were committed because of his impulse to have sex with the complainant when

the opportunity presented itself. The accused has no antecedents and there is no real likelihood

that he would repeat the offence. On the other side of the scale, he denied the charges and went

through a trial of seven days. Keeping in mind the principles set down in <i>Chia Kim Heng Frederick

v PP</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 361</nobr>, I sentenced the accused to eight years imprisonment and six strokes of

the cane on the first charge and eight years imprisonment on the second charge, with the custodial

sentences to run concurrently in view of the proximity in time and other circumstances of the two

offences.</p>
