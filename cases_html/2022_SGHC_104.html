</div> Jervois pointed to clause 1 of the Loan Agreement which describes the loan as an interest free personal loan extended by Mr Ang to Ms Ng for the Development, and contended that it was Ms Ng who had borrowed the money from Mr Ang (and presumably that Ms Ng had in turn lent the money to Jervois).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Whatever may be the merits of Jervois’ contentions, I did not think it was open to <span class="font-italic">Ms Ng</span> to seek to dispute liability under the Guarantee on the basis that she was the sole borrower, not Jervois. The Guarantee Ms Ng signed stated that the loan was one from Mr Ang to Jervois, and that Ms Ng agreed to guarantee repayment of the loan to Mr Ang. Having done so, Ms Ng could not turn around and deny liability as guarantor by arguing that she (and not Jervois) was the borrower, and so she could not guarantee her own obligation to repay the loan. Moreover, she did not plead this as a defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Even if it were open to Ms Ng to seek to avoid liability under the Guarantee by contending that she was the sole borrower, that contention would still not have worked. If Ms Ng were the sole borrower, it would follow that the Guarantee was not a true guarantee (in the legal sense of the word “guarantee”, whereby one assumes a secondary obligation based on the primary obligation of another). But that did not make the Guarantee ineffective: Ms Ng agreed to “guarantee the repayment of the [$1.6m]” to Mr Ang on the terms set out in the Guarantee, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to pay Mr Ang the sum of $1.6m if Jervois did not do so. That applied both to the scenario where Jervois <span class="font-italic">was not</span> obliged to pay Mr Ang anything (because Ms Ng was the sole borrower), and to the scenario where Jervois <span class="font-italic">was</span> obliged to pay Mr Ang the sum of $1.6m (because Jervois had borrowed that from Mr Ang). By agreeing to “guarantee the repayment” of that sum to Mr Ang, Ms Ng agreed that she would pay him the sum of $1.6m if Jervois did not – she remained obliged to do so whether or not the Guarantee was a true guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Leaving aside the words in the brackets in para 1 of the Guarantee, Ms Ng had agreed to guarantee the repayment of the said $1.6m to Mr Ang “upon receipt of the sale proceeds of the [Development] or by 28th May 2021, whichever is later”. That meant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) if the sale proceeds were received on or before 28 May 2021, Mr Ang would only need to be repaid the $1.6m by 28 May 2021; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the sale proceeds were only received after 28 May 2021, Mr Ang would only need to be repaid the $1.6m when the sale proceeds were received.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, this was qualified by the words in the brackets: “subject to the completion of the option to purchase exercised by the potential buyer and in any event full repayment shall be made on or before 30th September 2021”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The first phrase, “subject to the completion of the option to purchase exercised by the potential buyer” purports to make repayment of the $1.6m to Mr Ang contingent on “the completion of the option to purchase exercised by the potential buyer”. However, there was some debate in the hearing before me, as to what that meant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It was, however, the next phrase that was crucial for present purposes: “and <span class="font-italic">in any event</span> full repayment shall be made on or before 30th September 2021” (emphasis added). That meant that whether the sale proceeds had been received, whether there had been “completion of the option to purchase exercised by the potential buyer”, and indeed whether any option had been granted (or any units sold), Mr Ang was to be repaid the $1.6m on or before 30 September 2021. I agreed with Mr Ang that “in any event” means “regardless of what happens”.

</div> went against what is stated in the Guarantee – that in any event Mr Ang was to be repaid by 30 September 2021. Ms Ng’s contention would render meaningless the stipulation of payment by 30 September 2021 in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Ms Ng never disputed Mr Lim’s repeated assertions in September 2021 that the default position was that Mr Ang’s loan of $1.6m had to be repaid by 30 September 2021 (see [18] and [22] above). If she considered that she could defer payment indefinitely until the units were sold, she would have said so in her e-mail responses on 24 September 2021 and 6 October 2021, upon being reminded that repayment of the loan was due by 30 September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Even if repayment of the loan were contingent on the sale of the units, it was never the agreement or understanding between the parties that the sale of the units (and consequently, the repayment of the $1.6m) could be deferred indefinitely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  Clause 6 of the Loan Agreement (see [12] above) was a stipulation to the contrary. That clause stated that Ms Ng undertook that the Development would be completed and sold within the timelines imposed by IRAS, citing a link to IRAS’ website. That link, if accessed today, redirects one to the current webpage: https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/appeals-refunds-reliefs-and-remissions/common-stamp-duty-remissions-and-reliefs-for-property/sites-for-development-of-four-or-less-units-of-housing-accommodation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 That webpage (as at 19 January 2022, 5.42pm) is exhibited at pages 66–71 of Ms Ng’s affidavit. It is a commentary on the conditions for housing developers (of four or less units) to get remission of Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (“ABSD”). It states that extensions of the commencement, completion and sale timelines were variously announced on 6 May 2020, 8 October 2020, and 28 June 2021, in view of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the Loan Agreement (24 July 2018), however, these extensions had yet to happen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On 28 May 2018 (when Jervois accepted the Option, thus acquiring the Land), the applicable rules were the Stamp Duties (Non-Licensed Housing Developers) (Remission of ABSD) Rules 2015 (No S 764/2015) (the “Remission of ABSD Rules”) then in force. Under rule 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Remission of ABSD Rules, remission of ABSD was subject to the condition that “the housing developer completes the housing development, and sells all the units of housing accommodation that are the subject of the development within 3 years starting from the date of execution of the instrument [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, acceptance of the Option]”. That was also the position on 24 July 2018 when the Loan Agreement was executed (as the amendments to the Remission of ABSD Rules of 6 July 2018 did not affect rule 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To obtain remission of ABSD, the units in the Development thus had to be completed within 3 years starting from the date Jervois accepted the Option. That deadline would appear to be 28 May 2021, computed in accordance with s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (see also <span class="font-italic">Suresh s/o Suppiah v Jiang Guoliang</span> [2016] 4 SLR 645).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For completeness, the timelines for completion and sale to obtain ABSD remission have since been extended from 3 years (for both completion and sale) to 4.5 years for completion and 3.5 years for sale – the new timelines are thus: completion by 28 November 2022 and sale by 28 November 2021 (see IRAS’ website at [45] above). The parties were evidently mindful of the timelines to be adhered to for remission of ABSD, for there were references to selling the units by 27 November 2021 to avoid paying ABSD in the e-mail correspondence between the parties in September 2021.

</div> and if ABSD were required to be paid, that would adversely affect the profit earned from the Development (and Mr Ang’s share of that profit). Thus, clause 6 contained Ms Ng’s undertaking to complete and sell the units within the timelines imposed by IRAS for remission of ABSD, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, completion and sale by 28 May 2021 (based on the timelines prevailing at the time of the Loan Agreement).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I did not need to decide whether Ms Ng would still have complied with her undertaking in clause 6 of the Loan Agreement, if the units were not completed and sold by the original deadline of 28 May 2021, but were completed by the extended deadline of 28 November 2022 and sold by the extended deadline of 28 November 2021. The point was: this was never a project whereby Jervois and/or Ms Ng could indefinitely defer selling the units, and thus indefinitely defer repaying Mr Ang’s $1.6m loan. (For completeness, I note that even by the extended deadline of 28 November 2021 to sell the units, the units had not been sold.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The original IRAS deadline of 28 May 2021 for completion and sale of the units, was also a date mentioned in the Guarantee, whereby Ms Ng guaranteed repayment of the $1.6m to Mr Ang “upon receipt of the sale proceeds of the [Development] or by 28th May 2021, whichever is later”. Defining Ms Ng’s obligation under the Guarantee with reference to the date of 28 May 2021 was consonant with the parties expecting the units to be completed and sold by that date, to avoid payment of ABSD. As I stated above at [37], if the units had duly been sold by 28 May 2021 but the sale proceeds had yet to be received as at 28 May 2021, repayment of the $1.6m to Mr Ang would be deferred until the sale proceeds were received, and “subject to the completion of the option to purchase exercised by the potential buyer”. However, all this was subject to the long-stop date of 30 September 2021 by which Mr Ang would have to be repaid, for Ms Ng promised that “in any event full repayment shall be made on or before 30th September 2021”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The 28 May 2021 date in the Guarantee also accorded with the feasibility study, which provided “Return of Investment” figures and percentages for two scenarios: a “2 year Project”, and a “3 year Project”.

</div> Under clause 6 of the Loan Agreement, Ms Ng not only undertook that the Development would be completed and sold within the IRAS timelines for remission of ABSD; she agreed to manage the Development in accordance with the feasibility study, which made no reference to the project taking more than 3 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It was not Ms Ng’s case that the extension of the IRAS timelines for remission of ABSD gave her more time to comply with her obligations under the Guarantee. Moreover, the Guarantee made no reference to the IRAS timelines – in particular, the long-stop date of 30 September 2021 was simply stated as such. Again, Ms Ng’s only defence was that she did not need to pay Mr Ang until the units have been sold. However, I found that on the terms of the Guarantee, she could not delay repayment beyond 30 September 2021 even if the units had not been sold by then. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ms Ng’s liability under the Loan Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 My analysis above has focused on Ms Ng’s liability under the Guarantee. For completeness, I also considered what Ms Ng’s liability might be under the Loan Agreement – on the assumption that she (and not Jervois) was the borrower of the $1.6m from Mr Ang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Loan Agreement on its face did not state a specific date by which the $1.6m loan was to be repaid. There were two possibilities:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The repayment date of the loan should be reckoned with reference to the Guarantee – which was referred to in clause 4 of the Loan Agreement, and was executed together with it. Moreover, para 1 of the Guarantee referred to the Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Loan Agreement and Guarantee should be read separately, and there was simply no repayment date specified in the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Reckoning the repayment date with reference to both the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee had the attraction that the same two persons (Ms Ng and Mr Ang) had signed both documents, and the documents referred to each other: reading both documents together would therefore better reflect their intention. This was my preferred approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On this basis, it was implicit in Ms Ng guaranteeing repayment by certain dates (or upon certain events occurring) under the Guarantee, that under the Loan Agreement, Mr Ang should be repaid the $1.6m by the same dates (or upon the same events occurring). That would be (see [37]–[43] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) upon receipt of the sale proceeds or by 28 May 2021, whichever is later, subject to the completion of the option to purchase exercised by the potential buyer; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in any event, on or before 30 September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 If Ms Ng were liable under the Loan Agreement, rather than under the Guarantee, that would thus make no difference as to <span class="font-italic">when</span> she had to repay the $1.6m to Mr Ang – at the latest, she would have needed to do so by 30 September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 If, however, the two documents ought to be interpreted independently of each other, it would follow that no repayment date had been specified in the Loan Agreement. In view of clause 6, the parties would still expect the project to be completed and sold within 3 years, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 28 May 2021 (see [44] – [50] above). It might be argued that Mr Ang could not expect repayment until 28 May 2021, or a reasonable time thereafter for the proceeds to be received; but that did not improve Ms Ng’s position. The units were not sold by 28 May 2021, and moreover, it was well past that date by the time Mr Ang (through Mr Lim) demanded repayment of the $1.6m by 30 September 2021 via e-mails sent on 9 and 26 September 2021,

</div> That “default position” was set out by Mr Lim two paragraphs earlier: “Please be reminded again that the default position regarding Mr Ang’s loan of $1.6m is that it shall be repaid by 30 Sept 2021 …” Mr Lim had said the same about the “default position” in his earlier e-mail of 9 September 2021.

When Mr Ang sued on 25 October 2021 (following correspondence earlier that month), he was entitled to do so, claiming what was due to him as at 30 September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No stay of execution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Ms Ng sought a stay of my order for interim payment, but I declined to grant a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 A stay was sought based on the submissions in paras 66 to 81 of the defendants’ written submissions.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 However, that was <span class="font-italic">Jervois’</span> counterclaim, under which only Jervois claimed relief against Mr Ang. Furthermore, the losses said to have arisen from Mr Ang’s alleged breach of clause 11 of the Loan Agreement were Jervois’ losses, not Ms Ng’s – Jervois would be the one paying ABSD and/or selling the units at a lower value. Ms Ng did not raise a counterclaim, nor did she did claim any relief against Mr Ang. In the circumstances, Jervois’ counterclaim was not a basis on which to stay execution of an interim payment order against Ms Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Furthermore, the counterclaim was contingent on a finding that the Loan Agreement was binding between Mr Ang and Jervois, and I did not make such a finding at this stage. The premise of the counterclaim was explained as follows, in para 66 of the defendants’ written submissions: “In the event that the Agreement [the Loan Agreement] was found to be binding between the 1st Defendant [Jervois] and the Plaintiff [Mr Ang], the 1st Defendant would also have a valid counterclaim against the Plaintiff for a breach of Clause 11 of the Agreement.” I did not make any finding that Jervois was a party to the Loan Agreement; I simply upheld the assistant registrar’s decision granting Jervois unconditional leave to defend Mr Ang’s claim for the $1.6m (see [27]–[28] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It bears further noting that the counterclaim was based <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on an alleged breach of clause 11 of the Loan Agreement (set out at [13] above) –  no breach of the Guarantee by Mr Ang was alleged, nor was it alleged that Mr Ang had committed any other wrongful acts that resulted in Jervois or Ms Ng being unable to repay Mr Ang the $1.6m by 30 September 2021. The crux of the counterclaim was that the publicity of the litigation commenced by Mr Ang had made it difficult for the Development to be sold, such that it might even have to be sold at a loss. However, Mr Ang was justified in commencing proceedings to recover the $1.6m loan as he had done:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Ng was obliged to repay Mr Ang $1.6m by 30 September 2021, having guaranteed repayment of the $1.6m by that date “in any event”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ang was entitled to demand payment of that sum by 30 September 2021; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) by 25 October 2021, Ms Ng was already in default of her obligation to guarantee repayment of the $1.6m to Mr Ng by 30 September “in any event”; and  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Ang was therefore entitled to sue on 25 October 2021 and maintain the suit, having received no payment by 30 September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Granting a stay of the interim payment order would have been inconsistent with Ms Ng having agreed to guarantee repayment of Mr Ang’s $1.6m loan by 30 September 2021 “in any event” (see [40]–[43] above). If Ms Ng had any grievances to pursue against Mr Ang, she should still repay the $1.6m loan to Mr Ang first.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Ms Ng agreed to guarantee the repayment of Mr Ang’s loan of $1.6m, promising that “in any event full repayment shall be made on or before 30th September 2021.” However, she did not pay him anything by 30 September 2021, or indeed by the time the matter came before me on 21 March 2022, almost six months later. I thus made an interim payment order requiring her to pay Mr Ang the sum of $1.6m, with interest from 30 September 2021, and costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Yuen (Malkin &amp; Maxwell LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vijai Dharamdas Parwani (Parwani Law LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
