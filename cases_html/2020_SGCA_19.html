a 47-year-old male Singaporean, and Ranjit Singh Gill Manjeet Singh (“Ranjit”), a 46-year-old male Malaysian. They were found guilty and convicted of trafficking in not less than 35.21g of diamorphine (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, heroin) in 2016 after a joint trial before a High Court Judge (“the Judge”), an offence which carries the death sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Judge found that Ranjit was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). As the Public Prosecutor had issued a certificate of substantive assistance to Ranjit, the Judge exercised her discretion not to impose the death penalty and sentenced Ranjit instead to life imprisonment and the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane. The Judge held that Farid was not a mere courier. In any event, Farid did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. Accordingly, the Judge imposed the mandatory death sentence on him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Criminal Appeal No 17 of 2016 (“CCA 17/2016”) and Criminal Appeal No 19 of 2016 (“CCA 19/2016”) are, respectively, Farid’s and Ranjit’s appeals against conviction and sentence. Farid is appealing against his conviction on the ground that he did not have the intention of trafficking the drugs. For his appeal against sentence, he contended that the Judge was wrong to find that he was not a courier. Ranjit’s argument on appeal was that he had no knowledge of the nature of the drugs that were in his possession. Ranjit also made several complaints against his former defence counsel alleging that they had not conducted his defence at trial according to his instructions and thereby deprived him of the opportunity to put across his intended defence. This allegation was the subject of a criminal motion before us to adduce further evidence which we discuss subsequently in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 17 October 2019, we reserved judgment in Farid’s appeal and dismissed Ranjit’s appeal. In this judgment, we uphold Farid’s conviction but find that Farid was a courier for the drug transaction in question. However, since the Public Prosecutor did not issue Farid a certificate of substantive assistance, this finding has no effect on the sentence imposed. In Ranjit’s appeal, apart from giving our reasons for dismissing his appeal, we also discuss the principles involved in determining allegations made by accused persons against their counsel pertaining to non-compliance with instructions and inadequate legal assistance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Facts of the arrest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The factual background was set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts. On 6 February 2014, at about 6.10pm, a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) was despatched to conduct surveillance in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang Way on Farid who was expected to be using a car bearing registration number SJK 5768J (“the Car”). The CNB officers were also told to look out for a Malaysian-registered bus which was suspected to be carrying a consignment of drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At about 8.35pm, a Malaysian-registered bus bearing registration number JHD 5635 (“the Bus”) was seen parked beside the multi-storey car park at Block 610A, Choa Chu Kang Way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At about 9.20pm, the Car, whose driver was later identified as Farid, was seen travelling along Choa Chu Kang Way and making a U-turn. Shortly thereafter, the Car stopped in front of the Bus. A male Indian, later identified as Ranjit, alighted from the Bus. Ranjit was observed to be carrying a white plastic bag in one hand. Ranjit walked towards the Car. Through the open window at the front passenger side of the Car, Ranjit placed the said plastic bag on the front passenger seat. Farid then passed Ranjit a red and yellow package. Ranjit walked back to the Bus and boarded it. Thereafter, both of them went their separate ways in their respective vehicles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Car and the Bus were followed separately by two groups of CNB officers. At about 9.25pm, the CNB officers intercepted the Car at the slip road of Choa Chu Kang North 6 and Choa Chu Kang Drive, beside Yew Tee MRT station and placed Farid under arrest. At about 10.10pm, the CNB officers intercepted the Bus along Seletar Expressway and arrested Ranjit. Inside the Bus, the CNB officers found two envelopes under the driver’s seat containing $4,050 and $1,470 in cash.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Inside the Car, a white and black plastic bag with the word “ROBINSONS” was recovered (“the Robinsons Bag”). The Robinsons Bag contained a blue plastic bag containing another blue plastic bag containing three bundles wrapped in newspapers. One of the bundles contained one plastic packet containing a brownish granular/powdery substance. The other two bundles each contained two plastic packets containing a brownish granular/powdery substance. In total therefore, there were five such plastic packets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The five plastic packets containing the brownish granular/powdery substance were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. The HSA found that the five packets collectively contained not less than 1,359.9g of granular/powdery substances which contained not less than 35.21g of diamorphine (“the drugs”).

They did not find anything incriminating in his flat. Upon further questioning about whether there was anything else in Farid’s unit at the Regent Grove Condominium (“the Unit”), Farid answered in English “Got balance. About half.” This was recorded by a CNB officer. Farid was then escorted to the Unit. The CNB officers entered the Unit using the combination lock number given by Farid and his keys. Inside the Unit, Farid told the CNB officers where he kept the “balance” packet. Among other things, numerous empty plastic packets, two electronic weighing scales and a total of $13,888 in cash were found and seized. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Farid faced three charges under the MDA.

At the start of August 2013, he started facing financial problems with his business and he had to sell some of his buses to sustain it. Eventually, he was unable to maintain the liquidity necessary to keep his business going. Siva then offered him a job to deliver <span class="font-italic">makan </span>into Singapore. He said that Siva did not know what these items were because they were all pre-packed. The frequency of his deliveries of <span class="font-italic">makan </span>increased when Farid started to place orders.

The Judge found it clear that repacking drugs for the purpose of further distribution and sale was integral to Farid’s role. Farid had admitted during cross-examination that he was going to use the weighing scales and plastic packets at the Unit to repack the heroin. The Judge was not convinced by the argument by Farid’s counsel that the five packets of heroin in the Robinsons Bag were already in one-pound and half-pound packages and therefore did not require repacking. The Judge noted that Farid had admitted to having repacked heroin into smaller packets between 7.7 and 7.9g for the previous consignments. The Judge was of the view (at [64]), following <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yogaras Poongavanam </span>[2015] SGHC 193 at [28], that Farid was “someone who packs drugs into bundles as a routine after ensuring that the right type and quantity of the drugs go into the right packaging” and therefore did not qualify as a courier under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. In any event, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance to Farid.

These portions of the Disputed Evidence formed cogent evidence as they were contained in Ranjit’s and in Farid’s statements, which were not challenged on the ground of voluntariness. They provided relevant and sufficiently weighty evidence for the consideration of Ranjit’s state of mind and, specifically, the merits of any potential defence that he did not know what the Robinsons Bag contained apart from “something illegal”. The Judge added that Farid’s counsel intended to rely on the entirety of Farid’s statements for the purposes of Farid’s defence and that therefore it would have been premature to exclude them at that fairly early stage of the trial when it was still unclear as to what Ranjit’s defence would be. The Judge left it open for Ranjit’s trial counsel to submit on the relevance and/or weight to be accorded to such evidence later in the proceedings.

The Judge found it unbelievable that Ranjit understood <span class="font-italic">Air Batu</span> to refer to ice cubes and not methamphetamine when Perl had been asked to collect $7,400 upon delivery of the 75g of the substance.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Ranjit had also admitted in his third long statement that he knew that the <span class="font-italic">barang</span> in the Robinsons Bag was something illegal but he did not know the contents. He conceded in cross-examination that Siva had contacted him to deliver <span class="font-italic">barang</span> to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Further, the Judge noted Ranjit’s overall low level of credibility demonstrated in his oral testimony and found that Ranjit had failed to provide any sensible explanation for his failure to check or enquire into the contents of the Robinsons Bag (GD at [46]–[49]). The Judge was not convinced by Ranjit’s testimony that he was not at all curious or interested in the contents in the Robinsons Bag. As Ranjit could not prove that he had no knowledge of the nature of the contents in the Robinsons Bag, the Judge convicted him as charged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For completeness, the Judge made clear (at [50]) that she did not rely on Farid’s assertions that Ranjit was his boss Abang. Farid had claimed that he had not met Ranjit or Abang prior to 6 February 2014 and his conclusion that Ranjit was Abang was based on only two facts: that Abang had told Farid that he would be coming to Singapore and that Ranjit’s voice sounded like that of Abang over the phone. On the stand, Farid testified that “Ranjit was possibly the person that [he had] talked to on the phone”. The Judge considered this to be too tenuous a basis on which to find that Ranjit was Abang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Judge found that Ranjit’s role in giving delivery instructions to Perl and collecting the two envelopes of cash did not disqualify him from being a courier as these acts were in respect of distinct and separate drug transactions (GD at [55]–[59]). The Judge held, on a balance of probabilities, that Ranjit’s role in dealing with the drugs was merely to deliver them to Farid on Siva’s instructions and that this fell squarely within the acts of a courier set out in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. As the Public Prosecutor issued a certificate of substantive assistance to Ranjit, both requirements in s 33B were satisfied. In the exercise of her discretion under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, the Judge saw no reason to impose the death penalty. Ranjit was therefore given the alternative mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane (GD at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The criminal appeals</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Farid and Ranjit appealed against the Judge’s decision on their respective convictions and sentences. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Farid’s appeal (CCA 17/2016)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Farid filed his notice of appeal against conviction and sentence on 1 July 2016 and his petition of appeal on 16 November 2016. Subsequently, he filed Criminal Motion No 4 of 2018 on 19 January 2018 for leave to amend his petition of appeal. The amendments were essentially to elaborate on the reasons supporting his contention that he had rebutted the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the MDA and that, alternatively, he was a mere courier in the particular drug transaction before the court. We granted Farid’s application to amend his petition of appeal on 12 February 2018.

Farid argued that he was acting on Abang’s instructions when he collected the drugs. Given that Abang had not given any instructions on what to do with the drugs, the Judge erred in finding that Farid intended to traffic those drugs. Farid also argued that he had provided sufficient evidence to prove that he was a mere courier for the purposes of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(2) of the MDA. Relying again on the fact that Abang had not issued any instructions yet on what to do with the drugs in this particular transaction, Farid argued that he could not be said to have intended to repack the drugs, which would have enlarged his role to one beyond that of a mere courier. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ranjit’s appeal (CCA 19/2016)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Ranjit filed his appeal on 5 July 2016. In his appeal, he was represented by Mr Bachoo Mohan Singh and Mr Too Xing Ji (“Ranjit’s counsel on appeal”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Ranjit’s case on appeal was that the Judge was wrong to have found that Ranjit did not rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he had knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession) when he passed the Robinsons Bag containing the heroin to Farid on 6 February 2014. First, Ranjit’s counsel on appeal argued that the Judge was wrong to have admitted the portions of the Disputed Evidence and to have relied on them (see above at [30] and [31]). Ranjit’s counsel on appeal argued that such evidence was not cogent, did not raise a strong inference and was irrelevant.

Based on reported decisions, the value of one pound of heroin when delivered by a courier to a drug trafficker is about $5,000. As such, Ranjit ought to have collected about $15,000 for the 1,359.9g of drugs (roughly equivalent to three pounds) that he delivered to Farid on the day of his arrest.

The further evidence comprised nine categories of documents and the oral testimony and/or affidavits of four persons (“Further Evidence”).

We adjourn prayer 1 of the motion to be heard at the same time as the substantive appeal. Mr Singh’s case, at its highest, is this: He wishes to adduce the evidence in question in order to show that his client is a person of substantial financial means. He contends that this fact, if proved, could have had a material impact on the way the Judge viewed the probabilities when evaluating the applicant’s defence. On this basis, Mr Singh will contend at the appeal that the conviction is unsafe and the matter should be retried. In our judgment, that argument is best dealt with when we evaluate the robustness of the conviction as a whole. That is why we are making these orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 CCA 17/2016 and CCA 19/2016 came before us for hearing on 12 February 2018. In that hearing, we gave our preliminary view that the application to adduce the Further Evidence did not meet the criteria set out in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> [1954] 1 WLR 1489 (“<span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>”). In response, Ranjit’s counsel on appeal submitted that the Further Evidence was not adduced during the trial because Ranjit’s trial counsel did not abide by Ranjit’s instructions about his defence. We therefore gave Ranjit and his trial counsel the opportunity to file affidavits to explain what transpired during the trial.

Which constitutional and/or statutory provisions in Singapore law are relevant to this issue?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Do the facts of this case show that there was inadequate assistance of counsel in the proceedings below that would warrant the reliefs sought by Ranjit or some other relief?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Both the Prosecution and Ranjit’s counsel on appeal made substantial submissions on the Further Legal Questions. We will discuss them later in this judgment when considering whether Ranjit’s complaints against his trial counsel have any merit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Judge’s findings on remittal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The remittal hearing was heard by the Judge over two days on 25 and 26 September 2018. Ranjit and his trial counsel gave evidence during the hearing. The Judge gave her decision on 19 March 2019. Her grounds of decision can be found in <span class="font-italic">Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] SGHC 75 (“<span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Judge held that Ranjit failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that his trial counsel had failed to present his case in accordance with his instructions save for one limited aspect. This was Mr Retnam’s failure to cross-examine the recording officer and the interpreter on the statement recording process and to dispute the accuracy of Ranjit’s statement which mentioned that he knew <span class="font-italic">barang </span>to be illegal (<span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [72] and [79]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On the alleged failure of Ranjit’s trial counsel to challenge the admissibility of his statements on the basis that they were involuntarily made, the Judge found that there was no such instruction for the trial counsel to do so and that the agreed position was to the contrary. The Judge relied on the contemporaneous record of the prison visit on 29 December 2015 by Mr Retnam and Mr Selvaraj. The Judge gave full weight to this record because it was not alleged that it was fabricated and Ranjit was unable to challenge the accuracy of this record (<span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [51] to [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Judge was also of the view that it would be quite wrong to elevate each and every assertion made by Ranjit in his written notes to his trial counsel to the status of an “express instruction” to them. Ranjit’s notes which Ranjit claimed were his instructions contained his narration of the events and his responses to the contents of his statements to CNB. The Judge held that it was for Ranjit’s trial counsel to assess the information and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the assertions made by Ranjit, to advise him on their merits and to agree on the position to be taken at trial. On this basis, the Judge found that the position agreed with Ranjit was that there would not be any objection to the admissibility of the statements (see <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [55] to [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 On the alleged failure to present evidence that Ranjit was not in financial difficulties and to dispute portions of his long statement dated 11 February 2014 which stated that he was in financial difficulties, the Judge rejected Ranjit’s contention. The Judge held that while Ranjit had made such assertions, it remained for the previous lawyers to assess their merits and for parties to agree on the stance to be adopted at the trial. On this, the Judge accepted Mr Retnam’s and Mr Selvaraj’s explanation that raising Ranjit’s assertion regarding his financial position would affect his credibility as a witness given that it was inconsistent with his previous statement and his interview with Dr Kenneth Koh (“Dr Koh”), a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health. As such, disputing the portions of the long statement dated 11 February 2014 on this point carried some risk. The Judge found that in not dealing with this area, the trial counsel acted in accordance with the agreed approach to focus on the material aspects of the defence. Finally, the Judge also took note of the fact that in cross-examination, Ranjit admitted that he did not tell Mr Retnam or Mr Selvaraj that he wanted his financial status to be an important part of his defence (see <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([64] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60] to [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 On the alleged failure to challenge other aspects of Ranjit’s statements, the Judge noted that there were two main aspects to this allegation. The first pertained to the trial counsel’s failure to dispute the accuracy of Ranjit’s contemporaneous statement where he mentioned that there were three bundles in the Robinsons Bag. Ranjit’s assertion was that he only saw the three bundles after the Robinsons Bag was placed in the Bus. On this, the Judge accepted Mr Retnam’s position that he advised Ranjit not to challenge portions of his statements to the CNB which were irrelevant to the defence and Ranjit agreed with this general approach (see <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [68] and [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The second aspect pertained to Ranjit’s instructions to dispute the fact that he said <span class="font-italic">barang</span> meant something illegal. On this issue, the Judge found that under the general approach to Ranjit’s defence, it would have been in order for Mr Retnam to cross-examine the recording officer and the interpreter on the statement recording process and to dispute whether they accurately recorded the point in para 28 of Exhibit P134 which stated that Ranjit said, “‘Barang’ to me is something which is illegal”. It would also have been in order for Mr Retnam to adduce evidence from Ranjit on this matter. Mr Retnam did neither of these.

The Judge also said that the failure on that limited aspect did not have any effect on her verdict at the trial. She also held that the additional evidence adduced on the other issues had no effect on her verdict.

</div> In other words, Ranjit’s counsel on appeal was no longer contending that Ranjit’s trial counsel did not pursue Ranjit’s defence according to Ranjit’s instructions. Instead, Ranjit’s counsel on appeal argued that the Further Evidence should be admitted because the availability criterion in the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test should not be held strictly against accused persons in criminal appeal cases.

Applying this legal framework, Ranjit’s counsel on appeal argued that Ranjit had received inadequate legal assistance from his trial counsel and as a result, Ranjit was not able to advance his defence.

On the contrary, in Farid’s statements to the CNB (the accuracy of which he had confirmed in his testimony at trial), he consistently and candidly admitted that the Robinsons Bag was in his possession, that he knew or at least assumed it contained heroin and that his purpose in receiving those drugs was to distribute them according to Abang’s instructions.

His role involved the weighing and repacking of the drugs that he collected for Abang.

</div> The Prosecution also argued that little weight should be placed on the fact that the drugs in the Robinsons Bag came pre-packed in half-pound packets and so Farid need not repack them. Based on his previous consignments of heroin, Farid had been asked by Abang to repack the drugs into packages of various weights such as one-pound, half-pound and 7.7-7.9g packets.

This evidence demonstrated strongly that (i) Ranjit had carried out delivery of illegal items for Siva in the past; (ii) Ranjit knew that he was delivering something illegal to Farid; and (iii) Ranjit was simultaneously carrying out a suspicious transaction pertaining to 75g of <span class="font-italic">Air Batu </span>which was worth $7,400. Furthermore, this evidence was cogent because it was consistent with Ranjit’s conduct and explained why Ranjit was in possession of the drugs.

As to the Prosecution’s failure to investigate into Ranjit’s financial status at the material time, the Prosecution submitted that its <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations did not extend to an obligation to search for additional materials. In any event, Ranjit admitted in his statement to the CNB and informed Dr Koh that he was in financial difficulties and that his business was not doing well. There was no reason for the Prosecution to pursue a line of inquiry to prove otherwise. Finally, on not calling Siva to the stand, the Prosecution submitted that it had offered Siva to the defence as a witness and it was always open for Ranjit’s trial counsel to ask for time to interview Siva before deciding whether to take up the Prosecution’s offer. Ranjit’s counsel did not do so.

Abang’s instructions were for Farid to try to sell the methamphetamine and it was only when Farid could not find a buyer that he was instructed to return the drugs. There was therefore no basis for Farid’s counsel to argue that this particular consignment supported the possibility that Farid’s role might be to hold on to the drugs in issue with the intention of returning them to Abang. In fact, this incident concerning the methamphetamine supports the Prosecution’s case that Farid’s role was to deliver and/or distribute controlled drugs for Abang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We agree with the Prosecution that Farid did not adduce any evidence in the trial to establish that the drugs in his possession were for purposes other than delivery or distribution for Abang. In the light of Farid’s evidence at trial, we find no merit in Farid’s counsel’s argument that Farid had not formed the intention to traffic the drugs when he was arrested because he had not received any instructions from Abang as to whether he should return the drugs to Abang or to deliver them to Abang’s clients.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Prosecution submitted that the Judge did not err in her findings that Farid was not a mere courier in relation to the drugs. Farid was consistent in his evidence at the trial that he intended to repack the drugs and little weight should be given to the fact that the drugs came pre-packed in a one-pound bundle and in half-pound bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Having considered the evidence and the parties’ submissions, we agree with Farid’s counsel’s argument that given Farid’s role in the transaction, which was to collect the drugs and await Abang’s instructions and the fact that Abang had not given any instructions as to what Farid should do with the drugs as at the time of Farid’s arrest, it would be wrong to infer that Farid’s role in the drug transaction in question here was more than that of a mere courier. We therefore accept, on a balance of probabilities, that Farid was a mere courier. In our view, evidence of repacking drugs in previous transactions did not mean that the trafficker could not be a courier for the particular transaction that he is charged for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The following paragraphs in <span class="font-italic">Zamri</span> are apposite for the present case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15     While we accept that the burden of proof under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is on the accused, in our judgment, the Judge, with respect, erred when he framed the relevant issue in terms of whether the appellant could prove that Abang would not have instructed the appellant to repack the drugs. The focus of the inquiry required by s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA is on <span class="font-italic">the accused’s</span> acts in relation to the particular consignment of drugs which form the subject matter of the charge against him. Had he kept that focus, he might have realised, for reasons we elaborate on momentarily, that the appellant’s intentions at the relevant time were inchoate in the sense that they depended entirely on what someone else might decide or do at a point in time when no such decision or action had been made or taken.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16     In the present case, on the evidence before the court, it was, in truth, unknown and unknowable what the accused would have done after he had taken delivery of the drugs. As we have just noted, the appellant’s subsequent actions depended entirely on the decision and intentions of Abang, who was not before the court. Nor was there any basis for finding what Abang’s intentions or decision would have been having regard to the preceding interactions between the parties. If the circumstances were such that the appellant eventually received the instructions of Abang, those instructions could have been either to deliver the bundles as they were or to repack them. There was just no basis at all, on the evidence in this case, for the court to make a finding as to what those instructions would on a balance of probabilities have been, making the inquiry into that question inappropriate in the circumstances. The appellant said he would do as instructed, and <span class="font-italic">if</span> he had been instructed to deliver the drugs and nothing more, then had he adhered to those instructions, he would have acted as a courier. This analysis does not change even if, subjectively, he was willing to do more had he been asked to do more. In the absence of evidence that he had in fact already resolved to do more, even in the absence of any further instructions, or that he was committed to doing more, unless he was otherwise instructed, there was simply no basis to find that he was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a courier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Farid was consistent in his evidence that what he would do with the drugs in this case depended entirely on what Abang’s instructions were and no instructions had been received at the time of his arrest. This was consistent with what had happened in the previous heroin consignments. We therefore find the present case to be similar to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Zamri </span>([92] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 We agree with Farid’s counsel that little weight should be given to Farid’s conduct in previous heroin consignments. Abang’s instructions for each of those consignments were different and so it was not possible to infer what Abang’s instructions would be in relation to the drugs in the present case. For the heroin consignment on 4 February 2014 in which he received two pounds of heroin from a Chinese woman, Abang’s instruction was to repack the drugs into one-pound and half-pound packets.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 We mentioned earlier that Farid’s counsel contended that since the drugs came pre-packed in a one-pound bundle and four half-pound bundles, it was unlikely that Farid would need to repack the drugs. As pointed out above, Abang’s instructions to Farid in previous consignments were not consistent. It was therefore not possible, on this evidence alone, to infer what Abang’s instructions on this particular occasion would be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Applying the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Zamri </span>at [16], the evidence here only showed that Farid would do as he was instructed. In the absence of evidence that Farid had already been instructed by Abang to repack the drugs or that his role in the drug transactions was to repack the drugs unless otherwise instructed by Abang, it could not be said that Farid had done or was committed to doing anything that would make him more than a mere courier and thereby take him outside the ambit of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 We therefore allow Farid’s appeal on this issue only and hold that, for this particular drug transaction, he was a mere courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. However, as the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B to Farid, this finding does not change the outcome of the case and the mandatory death penalty stands. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ranjit’s appeal (CCA 19/2016)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 We dismissed Ranjit’s application and his appeal on 17 October 2019.

Ranjit claimed in his affidavit in support of CM 5/2017 that he did not understand what the Statement of Agreed Facts was and that he saw the statement only during the trial. He spotted numerous errors in the Statement of Agreed Facts only after his counsel on appeal went through the statement with him. He also claimed that he could not confirm or agree with the statement given that it contained admissions from Farid.

The Statement of Agreed Facts was also referred to no less than six times over the course of the trial. At no point in time did Ranjit make any objections to the statement.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Having considered the evidence, we agreed with the Prosecution. Ranjit’s allegations against the admission of the Statement of Agreed Facts were without basis. The Statement of Agreed Facts was read out in full on the first day of trial in the High Court and a Malay interpreter was present to assist both Farid and Ranjit (we say more about this at [142] below). It could not be the case that Ranjit did not understand or agree with the contents of the Statement of Agreed Facts since he made no complaints about it throughout the trial. As mentioned earlier, on 18 August 2017, we dismissed Ranjit’s application to set aside the Statement of Agreed Facts (see [43] above). Now that we have the benefit of the Judge’s findings in her <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> issued in the remittal hearing which took place after 18 August 2017, those findings fortify the correctness of our earlier decision to dismiss this prayer in CM 5/2017.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Application to adduce the Further Evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 On Ranjit’s application to adduce the Further Evidence, as we had noted at the hearing on 12 February 2018, this application did not meet the criteria set out in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>. We noted then as we also do now that the Further Evidence was available to Ranjit to adduce at trial. The Judge found in the <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span>, that Ranjit’s instructions to his trial counsel were not to raise arguments on his financial status at the trial (see <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [60] to [65]). As such, the Further Evidence was available at the trial but Ranjit chose not to adduce it. The Further Evidence was also not reliable in that it contradicted Ranjit’s own evidence that he was in financial difficulties. It was therefore not open to Ranjit to seek to adduce the Further Evidence in an attempt to present a different case at the appeal stage. The Further Evidence would also not be material because the Judge’s conclusion on Ranjit’s guilt was based on the totality of the evidence and was not anchored on Ranjit’s financial position. Accordingly, we dismissed CM 5/2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">CCA 19/2016: Ranjit’s appeal against conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The essence of Ranjit’s appeal against conviction was that he had rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he had knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession. To recapitulate, Ranjit brought the Robinsons Bag into Singapore in the Bus and passed it together with its contents to Farid on the night of 6 February 2014. As the Robinsons Bag was found to contain the drugs, s 18(2) of the MDA applied and it was presumed that Ranjit knew the nature of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In our view, the Judge was justified in admitting the relevant Disputed Evidence (see [29] to [31] above). Ranjit’s statements relating to his previous dealings with Siva on transporting <span class="font-italic">Air Batu</span>, <span class="font-italic">makan</span> and <span class="font-italic">barang</span> and his statements that he knew these were illegal things were made voluntarily. They were therefore cogent evidence and were highly relevant in that they provided the necessary context to Ranjit’s relationship with Siva and his role in transporting items for Siva into Singapore. The evidence also allowed the court to draw the necessary inference on Ranjit’s state of mind when he was asked to deliver items for Siva. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Ranjit’s statements to the CNB indicated that he suspected the items he was asked to deliver for Siva, whether they were <span class="font-italic">barang</span> or <span class="font-italic">makan</span>, were illegal things. Ranjit attempted to disavow those portions of his statements by alleging that they were not accurately recorded.

</div> The Judge found this to be unbelievable and we agree. It would not require a genius to know that 75g of ice cubes could not be worth that amount of money, never mind why someone needed this miniscule amount of ice cubes delivered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Even if we place Ranjit’s evidence at its highest in that he brought the Robinsons Bag into Singapore without knowing or seeing what it contained, we are of the view that Ranjit would still have failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities if we apply the principles set out in this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>”) at [39]. The judgment in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort </span>was delivered on 15 February 2017 after the Judge’s decision in the present appeal was made on 27 June 2016 and after the Judge’s GD was delivered on 6 October 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>, we said at [39]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a case where the accused is seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, as a matter of common sense and practical application, he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, particularly when the goods have to be carried across international borders as they could be prohibited goods or goods which are subject to tax. It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite. Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about. The presumption under s 18(2) operates to vest the accused with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At [40] of that decision, we set out some examples on the practical application of the above principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Applying the above principles to the facts of the present appeal, if Ranjit’s case in rebutting the presumption was that he was carrying something innocuous, his evidence could not be believed because he stated to the contrary in his statements. Further, as discussed earlier, his credibility was severely affected when he asserted that he believed that the <span class="font-italic">Air Batu</span> delivered by Perl was literally ice cubes. However, if Ranjit’s case in rebutting the presumption was that he knew he was delivering something illegal but did not turn his mind to what exactly it was, which appeared to be what he was asserting when he claimed that he was not at all interested or curious about the Robinsons Bag’s contents (see [32] above), then again he has not rebutted the said presumption. This is because, first, for the reasons already stated, he was found not to be credible as a witness. Second, to avoid the presumption becoming all bark and no bite as we said in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>, it cannot be rebutted by merely saying that he did not know what the thing in the Robinsons Bag was without proving that he believed it was something else when that was the very thing being presumed. Otherwise, his case would amount to nothing more than an assertion that the presumption should not apply and that would be impermissible given its statutory force.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 We therefore agreed with the Judge that Ranjit had not rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 As for Ranjit’s allegations that the Prosecution did not comply with its <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>obligations (see above at [41]), we found these allegations to be without merit. We agreed with the Prosecution there was no reason for the CNB to investigate further into Ranjit’s business and financial situation after he admitted that he was in financial difficulties. The fact that the Malaysian police looked into his bank accounts and could not find money tainted by illegality would make no material difference to the Judge’s findings which were amply supported by the evidence. In relation to the allegation that the Prosecution was slow in disclosing Siva’s availability as a witness for the Defence, the Prosecution did disclose about Siva to Ranjit’s trial counsel and it was open to the counsel to ask for an adjournment if they really needed more time to interview Siva. There was no evidence on record of Ranjit’s trial counsel applying for such adjournment. Finally, on the point that the Prosecution did not disclose the phone records of Ranjit’s main phone which held no incriminating evidence, this evidence alone would not dispel doubts that he was not involved in drug transactions. People who carry more than one phone could dedicate one phone for normal daily activities while using another phone for illegal activities. Overall, all these matters did not prejudice Ranjit’s defence given the other overwhelming evidence against him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ranjit’s claim on inadequate legal assistance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Ranjit claimed that he received inadequate legal assistance from his trial counsel and that his defence was not properly and adequately put across during the trial.

</div>
</div> Yong Pung How CJ considered the possible argument of inadequate legal assistance:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36     However, it is equally clear that the court will not allow the introduction of the additional evidence if it was actually considered by counsel at the trial but rejected because it was thought to be unnecessary or inappropriate or of doubtful assistance to the defence (see for example <span class="font-italic">R v Perry and Harvey </span>(1909) 2 Cr App R 89 and <span class="font-italic">R v Gatt</span>). As recently proclaimed by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Rodolpho de los Santos v R</span> [1992] 2 HKLR 136, if defending counsel in the course of a case made a decision or took a course which later appeared to have been a mistake or unwise, that, generally speaking, has never been regarded as a proper ground of appeal. A conscious decision not to adduce evidence, unless it amounted to flagrantly incompetent advocacy, did not provide a reasonable explanation for the failure to call at the trial the evidence which is sought to be introduced at the appeal. In the present case, as is quite apparent from Leong’s affidavit, the possibility of raising the defence of intoxication was considered but later rejected due to a perceived lack of evidence. It is also quite apparent that in adopting this course there was no professional conduct which could be termed ‘flagrantly incompetent advocacy’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37    Admittedly, there have been isolated instances where in an effort to correct glaring injustice, evidence which was in fact considered at the trial has been allowed to be introduced in an appeal. But this is warranted only by the most extenuating circumstances, which may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced was highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which rendered the conviction unsafe (see for example <span class="font-italic">Mohamed bin Jamal v PP</span> and <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Lattimore</span>). The circumstances in the present case fall far short of that mark.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Another pronouncement on inadequate legal assistance of counsel as a ground of appeal can be found in <span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 4 SLR 534. There, eight appellants appealed against their sentences for offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) on the basis that they were manifestly excessive. At [2], V K Rajah JA stated that “[i]f the matter proceeds to court, a solicitor’s failure to assist the court adequately would also result in wastage of judicial time and resources, and could even, in some instances, result in miscarriages of justice”. Rajah JA then made some observations on the conduct of the counsel at the trial below. At [11], Rajah JA found that “[i]t was clear from the outset that Mr Loo was dreadfully unprepared and had manifested a disturbingly careless attitude about the conduct of this matter even prior to the filing of the appeals”. Nevertheless, Rajah JA found that the sentences were not manifestly excessive and so dismissed the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 We will now consider how other common law jurisdictions have dealt with this issue before setting out the position which we think should be adopted in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other common law jurisdictions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) United Kingdom</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In <span class="font-italic">Regina v Clinton</span> [1993] 1 WLR 1181 at 1187–1188 (“<span class="font-italic">Clinton</span>”), the English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) held that “exceptionally, where it is shown that the decision was taken either in defiance of or without proper instructions, or when all the promptings of reason and good sense pointed the other way, it may be open to an appellate court to set aside the verdict by reason of the terms of section 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (c 19) (UK)]”. This statutory provision states that the court shall allow an appeal against conviction if it thinks that the conviction should be set aside on the ground that under all the circumstances of the case, it is unsafe or unsatisfactory. The court noted (at 1187) previous case law which held that the court should intervene only when counsel’s conduct of the case could be described as flagrantly incompetent advocacy and opined that such pronouncements were general guidelines on the approach to take rather than the legal standard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 After the United Kingdom adopted the European Convention of Human Rights and the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42) (UK), the cases have generally echoed the position in <span class="font-italic">Clinton</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In <span class="font-italic">Anderson v HM Advocate</span> 1996 SLT 155, the Scottish High Court of Justiciary reiterated the general rule that counsel have to follow their clients’ instructions and opined that when counsel’s conduct of the trial is raised as a ground of appeal, the conduct must be such as to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The court also noted that where allegations are made against counsel, they must be given a fair opportunity to respond in writing to such allegations although they are not obliged to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Malaysia</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Malaysian courts adopt the position of whether counsel’s conduct of the case was flagrantly incompetent given the circumstances of the case and whether such conduct deprived the accused person of a fair trial, thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Shamim Reza bin Abdul Samad v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 1 MLJ 471 at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Hong Kong</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In Hong Kong, the courts adopt the position in <span class="font-italic">Clinton</span> but with a focus on how decisive the effect of counsel’s error on the trial was and whether the appellant had a fair trial (see <span class="font-italic">R v Ho Ling &amp; Anor </span>[1996] 1 HKC 733, <span class="font-italic">R v Cheung Wai Kwong &amp; Anor </span>[1997] 3 HKC 496 and <span class="font-italic">Chong Ching Yuen v HKSAR</span> [2004] HKCU 464). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Australia</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In Australia, appeals based on inadequate assistance of counsel also focus on whether there was a miscarriage of justice although the standard is provided for in the individual state’s or territory’s statutes. In <span class="font-italic">R v Birks </span>(1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal summarised the relevant principles thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In later cases, the High Court of Australia clarified that descriptions of counsel’s conduct of a trial must not distract attention from the question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, taking into consideration the totality of the evidence at the trial. The appellate court will uphold the conviction even though counsel’s conduct was obviously inadequate if the evidence against the accused person was overwhelming (see <span class="font-italic">TKWJ v R</span> (2002) 212 CLR 124 and <span class="font-italic">Nudd v R</span> (2006) 225 ALR 161). Counsel would be at liberty to make legitimate tactical choices in order to avoid other risks at trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) New Zealand</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In New Zealand, appeals on the basis of inadequate assistance of counsel were originally based on s 385(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1961 (NZ) which provided that the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court must allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that there was a miscarriage of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In <span class="font-italic">R v Sungsuwan</span> [2006] 1 NZLR 730, the majority of the Supreme Court of New Zealand held the following at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In summary, while the ultimate question is whether justice has miscarried, consideration of whether there was in fact an error or irregularity on the part of counsel, and whether there is a real risk it affected the outcome, generally will be an appropriate approach. If the matter could not have affected the outcome any further scrutiny of counsel’s conduct will be unnecessary. But whatever approach is taken, it must remain open for an appellate Court to ensure justice where there is real concern for the safety of a verdict as a result of the conduct of counsel even though, in the circumstances at the time, that conduct may have met the objectively reasonable standard of competence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Tipping J opined that a “real risk arises if there is a reasonable possibility that a not guilty (or a more favourable) verdict might have been delivered if nothing had gone wrong” (at [110]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The legal position is now set out in s 232 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (NZ) which states that the court must allow an appeal in any case where a miscarriage of justice has occurred for any reason. A miscarriage of justice is defined as any error, irregularity or occurrence in or in relation to or affecting the trial that created a real risk that the outcome of the trial was affected or that has resulted in an unfair trial or a trial that was a nullity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) United States and Canada</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The United States Supreme Court’s approach to appeals on ineffective assistance of counsel rests on the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution which provides for the right of an accused person to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The United States Supreme Court has held consistently that the assistance of counsel must be effective for this right to serve any purpose (see <span class="font-italic">McMann v Richardson</span>, 90 SCt 1441 (1970)). The standard for determining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel was laid down by the Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Strickland v Washington</span>, 466 US 668 (1984) (“<span class="font-italic">Strickland</span>”). This involves a two-pronged test which the court stated was applicable regardless of whether the proceedings involve the possibility of capital punishment (as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Strickland</span>):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first limb of the test is that the accused person must show that his counsel’s performance was deficient, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering all the circumstances at the time. Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance is “highly deferential”, and there is a “strong presumption” that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of the law and facts are “virtually unchallengeable”. The reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be determined by the accused person’s actions and statements as well as information supplied by the accused person.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second limb of the test is that the accused person must show that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced his defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial. In other words, the accused person has to show affirmatively that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different (<span class="font-italic">Strickland </span>at 687–694).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The Canadian courts follow the United States’ two-pronged <span class="font-italic">Strickland</span> test although claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally made directly on appeal rather than in collateral proceedings upon the exhaustion of appeals as is the practice in the United States (see the Supreme Court of Canada case of <span class="font-italic">R v GDB </span>[2000] 1 SCR 520 and the Ontario Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">R v Garofoli</span> [1988] OJ No 35 (reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada on other grounds)).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal position to adopt in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In the light of the positions adopted in the major common law jurisdictions surveyed above, it is our opinion that the legal position to be adopted in Singapore should similarly be a two-step approach. The first step is to assess counsel’s conduct of the case and the second is to assess whether that conduct affected the outcome of the case, in that it resulted in a miscarriage of justice. We note here in passing that in the CPC, “failure of justice” is the term used in s 391(1) in relation to an omission to frame a charge. Similarly, s 423 of the CPC provides that any judgment, sentence or order may not be reversed or altered on account of any error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or lack of consent unless these have caused a “failure of justice”. However, the term “miscarriage of justice” appears in several sub-sections of s 394J concerning the exercise of the power to review an earlier decision of an appellate court. We do not think that there is material difference between these two terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 An appellant seeking to overturn his conviction on the basis that he did not receive adequate legal assistance must show that the trial counsel’s conduct of the case fell so clearly below an objective standard of what a reasonable counsel would have done or would not have done in the particular circumstances of the case that the conduct could be fairly described as flagrant or egregious incompetence or indifference. In other words, the incompetence must be stark and glaring. Certainly, it will not be enough to show that some other counsel, especially eminent or experienced ones, would have taken a different approach or perhaps would have been more combative towards the Prosecution’s witnesses. As long as counsel, whether at trial or on appeal, are acting in accordance with their clients’ instructions and in compliance with their duty to the court and their professional obligations, they must be given the deference and the latitude in deciding how to conduct the case after studying all the evidence and the applicable law. Legitimate and reasonable strategic or tactical decisions do not come within the very narrow class of cases where inadequate assistance of counsel can be said to have occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 These considerations apply equally to counsel’s conduct in the entire spectrum of his professional duties to his client in a criminal case - advising a client on whether to plead guilty or to claim trial, whether to accept an offer made as part of plea bargaining, on matters prior to and during trial and also on whether to appeal and the grounds for doing so. It must be remembered that allegations made against previous counsel could subsequently also be made against present counsel if the present counsel are not able to secure the desired outcome for the client. In this manner, such collateral attacks against court decisions could go on almost indefinitely. They are collateral attacks because they do not engage the merits of the court decisions on the evidence or the submissions made but seek to impugn the decisions indirectly by alleging that the court did not have the full evidence before it or was given wrong information because of inept counsel. The court must therefore be astute to ensure that its processes are not abused by incessant applications to retry or to re-open concluded matters by using such collateral attacks on court decisions through the device of complaints against previous counsel for alleged incompetence and/or indifference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Natural justice applies to the previous counsel of course and so, like anyone else accused of some wrong, he must be given notice of the allegations made against him and must have a reasonable opportunity to respond in writing and, where necessary, to attend and make submissions at the hearing where his conduct as counsel is an issue. In some instances, as in the present case, the appellate court may exercise its power under s 392 of the CPC to direct the trial court to take additional evidence on the narrow question of whether the allegations about counsel’s conduct of the case were justified and to state what effect, if any, the additional evidence has on its earlier decision. To ensure that counsel has a full opportunity to present his side of the story, the client must confirm that he is waiving his solicitor-client privilege in relation to the instructions, discussions and advice between him and that counsel. However, before the court considers such a course of action, it is incumbent on the client to particularise the alleged failure on the part of his former counsel and to persuade the court that there is a real point that warrants remittal to the trial court. If the court is satisfied that the client’s allegation against his former counsel has no substance in fact or does not meet the high threshold set out at [134]–[136] above, there will be no reason at all to exercise its power under s 392 of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 If inadequate legal assistance from previous counsel is proved under the first step in the inquiry, the second step is to show that there is a nexus between the counsel’s conduct of the case and the court’s decision in the matter in order to demonstrate a case of miscarriage of justice. The suggested standard required to show miscarriage of justice included “reasonable possibility” and “real possibility”. We note that s 394J(6) of the CPC (on the exercise of the power of review of an earlier decision of an appellate court) uses the terms “real possibility” and “powerful probability” in the context of what amounts to an earlier decision being “demonstrably wrong” in s 394J(5):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the appellate court may conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the criminal matter in respect of which the earlier decision was made, only if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the earlier decision (being a decision on conviction or sentence) is demonstrably wrong; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the earlier decision is tainted by fraud or a breach of the rules of natural justice, such that the integrity of the judicial process is compromised.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) For the purposes of subsection (5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), in order for an earlier decision on conviction to be “demonstrably wrong” —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) it is not sufficient that there is a real possibility that the earlier decision is wrong; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) it must be apparent, based only on the evidence tendered in support of the review application and without any further inquiry, that there is a powerful probability that the earlier decision is wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In our opinion, words of such qualitative nature naturally involve common-sense judgment calls which depend heavily on the particular situation presented to the court. However, in s 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the standard of “powerful probability” would appear to be more stringent since it was used in the context of “real possibility” in s 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) being insufficient to show a miscarriage of justice. The higher threshold of “powerful probability” is warranted in that section because there would already have been a concluded appeal to the relevant appellate court which did not succeed. In those circumstances, there is a very strong interest in the finality of criminal proceedings. Our present situation involves an appellant contending on appeal that his trial counsel had failed him. As set out at [134]–[136] above, an appellant making such allegations against his former counsel has a high threshold to cross. We think therefore that we only need to adopt the standard of “real possibility” in s 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for such an appellant to meet in order to satisfy the court at the second step of the inquiry. An appellant who has established a case of inadequate legal assistance from his previous counsel must therefore also show that there is a real possibility that such inadequate assistance has caused a miscarriage of justice on the particular facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Ranjit’s counsel on appeal argued that Ranjit’s trial counsel’s conduct was unreasonable in that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) They signed the Statement of Agreed Facts without consulting Ranjit (“first allegation”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Retnam failed to provide Ranjit with the full committal bundle (“second allegation”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Retnam failed to share Ranjit’s written instructions with his co-counsel (“third allegation”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ranjit’s trial counsel disregarded Ranjit’s instructions on his financial status (“fourth allegation”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Retnam failed to lead evidence on whether “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” meant something illegal (“fifth allegation”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 As we noted above at [75], Ranjit’s counsel on appeal did not seek to challenge the Judge’s <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span>. At the hearing before us on 17 October 2019, Ranjit’s counsel on appeal confirmed Ranjit’s position in that regard. Instead, Ranjit relied on the Judge’s finding in the <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> that Mr Retnam ought to have cross-examined the recording officer and the interpreter on the issue of whether the statement recorded accurately that Ranjit knew that <span class="font-italic">barang</span> meant something illegal. We therefore dealt with Ranjit’s arguments on inadequate legal assistance of counsel bearing this in mind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The first allegation concerned the Statement of Agreed Facts. We acknowledge that it would have been good practice for Ranjit’s trial counsel to have shown him the Statement of Agreed Facts and to seek his consent to admit the matters set out in that statement. Nevertheless, we note that the Statement of Agreed Facts was read out in full in court by the Prosecution soon after the pleas to the respective charges were taken from the accused persons.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> A Malay interpreter was in court to assist both Farid and Ranjit. At the conclusion of the reading, the Judge asked the respective trial counsel to confirm that the stated facts were not disputed and could be admitted. Both Farid’s and Ranjit’s trial counsel gave the confirmation. Ranjit was therefore aware of all this from the start of the trial in the High Court and, as mentioned earlier, did not raise any objection during the rest of the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Before us, Ranjit did not highlight anything within the Statement of Agreed Facts that was not in keeping with his instructions. In other words, the contents of the Statement of Agreed Facts were consistent with the agreed approach to be taken for Ranjit’s defence. The Judge found that there was an agreement between Ranjit and his trial counsel to focus on the defence of Ranjit’s lack of knowledge of the contents of the Robinsons Bag. It was also agreed that they would not challenge the admissibility of his statements. Further, Ranjit also did not instruct his trial counsel that he need not traffic in drugs for money as he was financially sound. These findings were not appealed against and the trial counsel’s failure to consult Ranjit before agreeing to the Statement of Agreed Facts must be seen in that context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Following from the above findings, the fourth allegation is a non-starter since the Judge found that Ranjit did not instruct his trial counsel that he need not traffic in drugs because he was financially sound. In fact, if they had led evidence to try to show that he was financially sound, it would have affected Ranjit’s credibility adversely as Ranjit had admitted in his psychiatric report that he was experiencing financial difficulties. The Judge also found that this was the reason Ranjit’s trial counsel did not pursue this at the trial (see <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [60] to [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 For the second allegation, Ranjit did not explain to the court how his trial counsel’s failure to pass him the full committal bundle prejudiced his defence in any way. He did receive the full committal bundle during the trial.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Ranjit could have discussed with his trial counsel if he had any concerns regarding the case. He had ample time since this was relatively early in the trial. Even so, Ranjit did not elaborate on how his defence was compromised because of the late receipt of the full committal bundle and how the outcome of the trial would have been affected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 For the third allegation, we agree with the Judge that it would have been good practice for Mr Retnam to have shared Ranjit’s written instructions with co-counsel. However, as with the second allegation, Ranjit did not point to how this had, in any way, prejudiced his defence. There was therefore nothing to suggest that the outcome of the trial was affected to his detriment. In any event, Ranjit’s trial counsel ultimately did conduct Ranjit’s defence according to his instructions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The fifth allegation relates to Mr Retnam’s failure to lead evidence on whether <span class="font-italic">barang</span> meant something illegal. This finding by the Judge meant that trial counsel did not comply with Ranjit’s instructions in this “one limited aspect” (<span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [79]). However the Judge said that this failure would have no effect on her decision (for the reasons given at <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span> at [73]–[77]). The Judge explained that quite apart from the admission in Ranjit’s statement that he knew that <span class="font-italic">barang</span> was something illegal, there was “overwhelming evidence” to show that he knew he was delivering illegal items for Siva and that the Robinsons Bag contained something illegal. For good measure, the Judge also stated at [81] that the additional evidence in the remittal proceedings covering the other areas would have no effect on her earlier decision. As Ranjit did not appeal against the <span class="font-italic">Findings on Remittal</span>, which we think were entirely justified in any case, there was no basis to argue that this one failure on trial counsel’s part affected the outcome of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 For the reasons set out above, Ranjit’s assertions about inadequate legal assistance from trial counsel have no merit. As we have indicated earlier, his appeal against conviction was dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 We dismiss Farid’s appeal against conviction and sentence. For this particular transaction, we hold that Farid was a mere courier within the meaning of s 33B of the MDA. However, since the Prosecution did not issue him a certificate of substantive assistance, this holding does not affect the outcome of Farid’s case. The mandatory death penalty imposed by the Judge therefore stands.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 For Ranjit’s application to withdraw the Statement of Agreed Facts and to adduce the Further Evidence, we found that there was no merit in the application. We also found that there was no reason to disagree with the Judge’s findings. We therefore dismissed CM 5/2017 and Ranjit’s appeal against conviction and sentence at the earlier hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 We note that Ranjit’s trial counsel did not keep notes of all the interviews they had with him. We think it is good practice for counsel and their assistants to record instructions from their clients and, where necessary, have the notes signed by them as confirmation. This will protect the lawyers against unwarranted allegations and help them present their side of the story especially when the allegations are made long after the trial and memory has become less reliable. We are conscious of the fact that some instructions may be given orally in court during cross-examination of witnesses or during a short recess during trial and that therefore recording and signing of notes of instructions would be impracticable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 There is presently no statutory procedure on how accused persons should raise inadequate legal assistance of previous counsel as a ground of appeal in criminal proceedings. As we have indicated above, such assertions are effectively a collateral attack against the trial court’s decision rather than an appeal on its merits. In its written submissions of 23 September 2019, the Prosecution set out its detailed recommendations for the procedure to be used in such cases. We do not propose to discuss these recommendations in this judgment as we think it would be much more useful to consider whether there is a need for criminal procedure rules to govern such applications and, if the decision is that there is such a need, then the relevant stakeholders can be consulted and the matter put forward to the relevant rule-making authority. In any case, we hope that such applications will be extremely rare as we believe that the vast majority of members of the criminal law Bar take their responsibilities seriously and always strive to do their best for their clients in conformity with the law, their duty to the court and their professional obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon                   Judith Prakash        Tay Yong Kwang <br/>Chief Justice                           Judge of Appeal                 Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thangavelu (Thangavelu LLC), Eugene Thuraisingam and Syazana Yahya (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the appellant in CA/CCA 17/2016 and applicant in CA/CM 4/2018;<br/>Bachoo Mohan Singh and Too Xing Ji (BMS Law LLC) for the appellant in CA/CCA 19/2016 and applicant in CA/CM 5/2017;<br/>Terence Chua, Jason Chua and Chong Yong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent in CA/CCA 17/2016, CA/CCA 19/2016, CA/CM 5/2017 and CA/CM 4/2018. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Case summary</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Mohammad Farid bin Batra v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter </span></em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[2020] SGCA<em> </em>19<em><br/>
</em>Criminal Appeals Nos 17 and 19 of 2016 and Criminal Motions No 5 of 2017 and No 4 of 2018</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JA):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>Court of Appeal affirmed Mohammad Farid’s and Ranjit Singh’s convictions and sentences for trafficking in not less than 35.21g of diamorphine but holds that Mohammad Farid was only a “courier” for this particular transaction.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Mohammad Farid bin Batra (“Farid”) and Ranjit Singh Gill Manjeet Singh (“Ranjit”), were found guilty and convicted of trafficking in not less than 35.21g of diamorphine after a joint trial before a High Court Judge (“the Judge”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Judge found that Ranjit was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). As the Public Prosecutor had issued a certificate of substantive assistance to Ranjit, the Judge exercised her discretion and sentenced him to life imprisonment and the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane. As for Farid, the Judge held that he was not a courier. In any event, Farid did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance. Accordingly, the Judge imposed the mandatory death sentence on him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Criminal Appeal No 17 of 2016 (“CCA 17/2016”) and Criminal Appeal No 19 of 2016 (“CCA 19/2016”) were, respectively, Farid’s and Ranjit’s appeals against conviction and sentence. Farid contended that he did not have the intention of trafficking the drugs and also appealed against the finding that he was not a courier. Ranjit appealed on the ground that he had no knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession. Ranjit filed a criminal motion before the Court of Appeal (“the Court”) to adduce further evidence pertaining to his financial status at the time leading up to his arrest (“the Further Evidence”). Ranjit also alleged that he had received inadequate legal assistance from his trial counsel.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 6 February 2014, Farid and Ranjit met in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang Way. Ranjit alighted from the bus he was driving, walked towards Farid’s car and placed a white plastic bag (“the Robinsons Bag”) on the front passenger seat through an open window. Subsequently, Farid and Ranjit were arrested by CNB officers separately. The Robinsons Bag was found to contain five plastic packets of diamorphine which formed the subject matter of the respective charges.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Remittal proceedings</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Ranjit’s counsel submitted that the Further Evidence was not adduced at the trial because his trial counsel did not abide by his instructions. The Court thus remitted the case to the Judge to take further evidence on Ranjit’s allegations against his trial counsel.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Judge held that Ranjit failed to prove that his trial counsel had failed to present his case in accordance with his instructions save for one limited aspect. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court of Appeal’s decision </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">CCA 17/2016</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>In respect of Farid, it was beyond dispute that he had intended to traffic the drugs as he had offered and was prepared to deliver the drugs to the clients of “Abang” (at <strong>[86]</strong>). The Court rejected Farid’s counsel’s submission that there was a possibility that Farid could be instructed by Abang to return the drugs to him. There was no evidence adduced in the trial to establish that the drugs in Farid’s possession were for purposes other than delivery or distribution for Abang (at <strong>[90]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court accepted that Farid’s role in the transaction was to collect the drugs and await Abang’s instructions. On this particular occasion, Abang had not given any instructions yet as to what Farid should do with the drugs, including whether it was to be repacked. Thus, the Court accepted, on a balance of probabilities, that Farid was a courier for the particular transaction that he was charged for (at <strong>[94]</strong>). However, as Farid was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance, the Court upheld the mandatory death sentence imposed by the Judge. Farid’s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">CCA 19/2016</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>In respect of Ranjit, the Court noted that Ranjit did not seek to challenge the Judge’s findings in the remittal proceedings that his trial counsel had presented his case in accordance with his instructions save for one limited aspect (at <strong>[101]</strong>). The Court found that the Further Evidence was available to Ranjit at trial but he chose not to adduce it. It was also not reliable and not material to Ranjit’s conviction (at <strong>[105]</strong>). The Court dismissed the criminal motion to adduce the further evidence.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Ranjit failed to rebut the statutory presumption that he had knowledge of the nature of the drugs. If his case was that he was carrying something innocuous, his evidence could not be believed because he stated to the contrary in his statements. If his case was that he knew he was delivering something illegal but did not turn his mind to what exactly it was, the presumption would not be rebutted as he was not a credible witness and he could not merely say that he did not know what was in the Robinsons Bag without proving that he believed it was something else (at <strong>[113]</strong>).  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Turning to Ranjit’s claim that he had received inadequate assistance from his trial counsel, the Court held that this was to be assessed through a two-step approach. First, the accused person must show that the trial counsel’s conduct of the case fell so clearly below an objective standard and could be fairly described as flagrant or egregious incompetence or indifference (at <strong>[135]</strong>). Second, the accused person must also show that there is a real possibility that the inadequate assistance caused a miscarriage of justice (at <strong>[139]</strong>). Applying this two-step approach, the Court found that Ranjit’s assertions had no merit (at <strong>[148]</strong>). Ranjit’s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.</span></p>
