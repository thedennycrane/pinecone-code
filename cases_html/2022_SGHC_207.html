The plaintiffs are investors in Asia Strategic Mining Corporation Pte Ltd (“ASMC”). They were guaranteed monthly payments representing returns on their investment over a period of five to eight years. In late 2018, less than two years after their initial investment, these monthly payments ceased. The plaintiffs have lost a not insignificant sum of money and cry foul. They accuse the defendants of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, perpetrating a fraudulent investment scheme which induced them to invest and when things took a turn for the worse, fraudulently inducing them to refrain from taking or prosecuting legal proceedings while the alleged perpetrators diverted or dissipated funds away from the plaintiffs’ reach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiffs commenced proceedings against, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, ASMC in a separate suit (HC/S 189/2019) and have since obtained summary judgment against ASMC for the full sum that is owed to them amounting to S$616,700. In the present action, the plaintiffs seek to recover a similar sum from the second defendant, who was ASMC’s Manager of Public Relations and Customer Services at the material time. In essence, the plaintiffs’ case theory is that the second defendant was responsible for making various misrepresentations to the plaintiffs (as part of an unlawful means conspiracy with the first defendant), which in turn caused the plaintiffs to forbear from commencing legal action against ASMC and/or taking other legal or investigative steps, and which ultimately facilitated the dissipation of money from ASMC to other parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 While there are currently two defendants named in the action, the first defendant, Mr Ishak Bin Mohamed Basheere, failed to file his and his witnesses’ Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEICs”) within the timelines stipulated by the Assistant Registrar at the pre-trial stage. Accordingly, pursuant to the Assistant Registrar’s peremptory order made at a pre-trial conference hearing on 26 August 2021, the first defendant’s Statement of Defence has been struck out in its entirety with the plaintiffs entitled to enter final judgment against the first defendant.

During this period, the second plaintiff also attended meetings with the first and/or second defendant, to discuss, among other things, an early redemption of the Contracts and alleged difficulties faced by ASMC in making payments to funders.

</div> The essence of the plaintiffs’ pleaded claims is encapsulated in paras 7A and 7B of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) (“Statement of Claim”), which bear reproducing below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7A. It was never intended that ASMC would perform its payment obligations towards the Plaintiffs in full. The Five Contracts formed part of the fraudulent investment scheme procured by the First Defendant by way of various false representations made to the Plaintiffs, the details of which are set out in Section IV of this Statement of Claim. ASMC is and was at all material times a mere corporate vehicle through which the fraudulent investment scheme was perpetrated by the First Defendant, and subsequently, the Second Defendant as a co-conspirator after he joined ASMC in August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7B. Pursuant to the fraudulent investment scheme, the Defendants’ modus operandi was as follows. Pursuant to the First Defendant’s misrepresentations, the funder would first provide his investment capital known as the ‘funding sum’ to ASMC at the commencement date. Monthly repayments by ASMC would then be made to the funder from the time of commencement up to sometime in late 2018. Thereafter, payments would cease entirely, and the Plaintiffs would never receive full repayment of their principal investment sum and promised returns. When pressed for clarification, the Second Defendant would respond in a highly evasive and/or dishonest manner, citing multiple vague and dilatory excuses pertaining to banking issues and unforeseen circumstances, whilst at the same time supplying additional false and/or misleading information to the funders to dissuade them from commencing legal proceedings and/or taking out such other proceedings to prevent the dissipation of funds and investigations into the relevant parties to take out such proceedings as necessary. This is to buy time so that the monies could be dissipated out of ASMC, paid to other investors and/or transferred to ISK Capital Pte Ltd’s bank account in Malta.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 For completeness, among the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in the Statement of Claim is what can only be described as a curious claim for a “Performance bond by BNP Paribas to be issued by ASMC in favour of the Plaintiff” (the “BNP Paribas Performance Bond”).

Based on the e-mails from the second defendant which the plaintiffs rely on for their misrepresentation claim (as set out at <span class="font-weight-bold">Annex A</span>), none of these e-mails expressly states that the purported banking issues related specifically and only to the DBS Account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 On the contrary, I note that the second defendant’s e-mail of 15 May 2019 stated that “I can state with confidence that the funds will clear within our Singapore <span class="font-italic">UOB </span>account soon” [emphasis added].

</div> For instance, in relation to the mass e-mails sent out to funders, the second defendant testified that these e-mails would be drafted by the first defendant, before being amended by ASMC’s CEO, Dr Willem Smuts (“Dr Smuts”) and/or another senior manager in the company, Ms Surina Binte Awang.

</div> The second defendant’s role was to then proofread the e-mails for grammatical or spelling errors before sending out the e-mails. In addition, the second defendant explained that he had believed the truth of the communications he sent out on behalf of his superiors. This was because he had, for example, been reassured by Dr Smuts at the material time that ASMC was “doing perfectly well” and that the company just had “some temporary payment issues”. The second defendant had no reason to doubt this reassurance, as he trusted Dr Smuts and his qualifications as a geologist.

The absence of such evidence, the plaintiffs contend, goes to show that the second defendant lied about receiving instructions from his superiors and was effectively making up stories to shore up his defence, when in fact he had no reasonable grounds for representing that ASMC would make payment.

</div> Having seen and observed the second defendant during cross-examination, I find this to be a reasonable explanation and therefore accept it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any case, as I have observed above at [36], the burden of proving the falsity of the Representations falls on the plaintiffs. In the absence of any other evidence supporting the plaintiffs’ case, I find that the plaintiffs have not proven on a balance of probabilities that the Fourth Representation is false. Following from this finding, the plaintiffs have not, in my judgment, established the first element of their claims for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. Accordingly, I would dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims on this basis alone.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs did not rely on the Representations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Nonetheless, I turn to consider the next element of the claims for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, which is that the plaintiffs relied on the Representations. In my judgment, the plaintiffs have also not succeeded in proving that they did so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As noted above at [12], the plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that as a result of the Representations, they forbore from commencing or prosecuting legal proceedings against ASMC, entering summary judgment against ASMC expeditiously, commencing investigations and/or taking necessary legal action to prevent the dissipation of funds by ASMC. In this light, I find it striking that nowhere<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the plaintiffs’ pleadings, AEICs or closing submissions, is it stated <span class="font-italic">what </span>precise legal action or investigations the plaintiffs forbore from commencing. In his oral submissions before me, Mr Lun submitted that but for the Representations, the plaintiffs would have “considered filing an injunction to freeze [ASMC’s] monies [to prevent them] from being dissipated”.

</div> Yet crucially, this was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the evidence of the first or second plaintiff, either on affidavit or in cross-examination. In fact, Mr Lun’s oral submissions were the first (and only) instance in which it was suggested that the plaintiffs had specifically refrained from applying for a Mareva injunction against ASMC, as a result of the Representations made by the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In addition, the plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that the Representations caused the plaintiffs to forbear from commencing legal proceedings from October 2018 to 31 July 2019. Yet, there is no evidence before me to suggest that the plaintiffs were indeed prepared to commence legal action against ASMC from as early as October 2018. Again, the first and second plaintiff did not give evidence to this effect in their AEICs or in cross-examination. Indeed, in his oral submissions, Mr Lun candidly conceded that it was not evidence put forth by either party that the plaintiffs were ready to sue ASMC in October 2018.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, the available evidence demonstrates that the plaintiffs did <span class="font-italic">not</span> rely on the Representations. First, I note that the plaintiffs’ own evidence suggests that the Representations did not operate on their minds in late 2018. For one, the second plaintiff deposed in his AEIC that it “became clear” to him in late 2018 that ASMC and/or the defendants were unlikely to make full repayment of the principal sum the plaintiffs had invested, as well as payment of the promised returns under the five Contracts.

</div> In the circumstances, it does not stand to reason that the second plaintiff would believe or rely on the Second and Fourth Representations that payment would be made as promised, and that ASMC was ready and willing to make payment. In a similar vein, I note that while the second plaintiff claims that the Third and Fourth Representations were made to him by the second defendant at the Concorde Hotel meeting (S/N 1 of <span class="font-weight-bold">Annex A</span>), the second plaintiff’s evidence is also that he rejected all proposals made to him at the Concorde Hotel meeting as he “just wanted [his] monies back”.

</div> As noted above at [10], the first plaintiff sent a letter of demand through his former solicitors to ASMC on 10 January 2019, and subsequently commenced HC/S 189/2019 against ASMC on 15 February 2019. In cross-examination, the second plaintiff was not able to credibly explain how he (or the plaintiffs collectively) could have been induced by the Representations into forbearing from commencing legal action, despite the commencement of HC/S 189/2019 by the first plaintiff. In this regard, the second plaintiff’s evidence was that he was still “affect[ed]” by the Representations, as the commencement of HC/S 189/2019 did not mean that the defendants would “settle with [him] on what [he] claim[ed] against them”.

I find some force in the second defendant’s argument that the intervening period was caused by various interlocutory applications filed by the parties, such that the defendants in HC/S 189/2019 only filed their Statement of Defence on 11 July 2019.

</div> I do not agree that this shows that the second defendant had therefore necessarily sought to hold himself out as a senior member of ASMC’s management at the material time. In my view, it is clear from the second defendant’s explanations that he had addressed ASMC’s funders in the first person simply out of a desire to provide what, to his mind, would constitute “good” customer service, and not because he was (or held himself out to be) a part of ASMC’s management.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Nor do I find it out of the ordinary that a customer services manager would need to have regular contact or be in communication with the legal or finance team within the company. In my judgment, I also find that the second defendant’s explanations as to why he had used the ASMC management e-mail address, or why he had a personal assistant, are not fanciful or outside the realm of reality. In the circumstances, I disagree with the plaintiffs that the second defendant was a key member of ASMC’s management or held himself out as such, because of the <span class="font-italic">indicia </span>raised at [56] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, the plaintiffs claim that it was not put to them in cross-examination that they had not placed any reliance on the Representations.

</div> This is not true.

Further, I reject the argument made by Mr Lun in the course of oral closing submissions that the second defendant is precluded from arguing that the plaintiffs placed no reliance on the Representations, because this was not expressly pleaded in the Statement of Defence (“Defence”).

Under the sales contract, the defendant vendors had warranted that the tax liabilities of UMPL’s wholly owned subsidiary had been fully discharged. It was later discovered that this was in fact not the case and that Columbia had been exposed to potential future tax liabilities as a result. Columbia therefore claimed against the defendants for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, damages for a loss of chance to negotiate a lower purchase price for the shares, in view of the potential future tax liabilities it was exposed to (at [147]–[148] and [193]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) rejected the claim for damages for the loss of a chance, noting as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">201 In the first place, the statement of claim did not plead damages by way of a loss of chance.

In that case, the plaintiff (“Tembusu”) had invested in the first defendant (“AI”) through a convertible loan agreement. In separate litigation, it had been found that Tembusu had committed an anticipatory breach of the loan agreement by prematurely declaring that AI had breached the loan agreement (at [3]). AI claimed for damages arising out of Tembusu’s anticipatory breach. In this regard, AI’s pleaded case was, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that Tembusu’s breach had derailed AI’s planned initial public offering (“IPO”), which caused AI to lose the “benefit” of the IPO (at [5] and [95]).

Vinodh Coomaraswamy J noted the general rule that parties are bound by their pleaded cases (at [93]–[94]), but nonetheless went on to observe that AI’s loss of chance claim “[drew] on the same body of evidence adduced at trial” in support of its pleaded claim (at [95]).

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, the present case is unlike <span class="font-italic">Columbia Asia</span>, where Columbia had pleaded a general claim for damages without more. In this case, I find that it is at least implicit in the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that their claim is one for a loss of chance. To begin with, the very meaning of forbearance is that the plaintiffs had (allegedly) opted <span class="font-italic">not </span>to seize a chance to commence and/or prosecute legal action (and thereby secure recovery of their claim), when they otherwise would have but for the Representations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Further, based on the plaintiffs’ pleaded case alone, it is clear that the key issues arising from it would include: (a) whether the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>would have commenced and/or prosecuted legal proceedings expeditiously, had the second defendant not made the Representations; and (b) had the plaintiffs commenced and/or prosecuted legal proceedings against ASMC expeditiously, how much (if any) they would have recovered from ASMC. As will be clear from my analysis at [76] below, these are essentially the same issues that would have arisen if the plaintiffs had pleaded their claim as one for a loss of chance. Moreover, the fact that these issues arose from the plaintiffs’ pleaded case did not escape the second defendant. For instance, in his closing submissions (which were filed <span class="font-italic">before </span>the plaintiffs reframed their claim as one for a loss of chance), the second defendant argued that the plaintiffs have “mischaracterised their loss” as the full sum due under the Contracts. The proper characterisation of the plaintiffs’ loss, the second defendant submitted, should be the difference between the sum that the plaintiffs would have recovered had they taken legal action expeditiously, and the sum the plaintiffs would have recovered from taking legal action later on, which the plaintiffs have not proven.

</div> In my view, this argument goes toward issue (b) above (on whether the plaintiffs have proven how much they would have recovered from commencing legal proceedings expeditiously), and is also an argument relevant to determining whether the plaintiffs’ claim for loss of chance has any merit, as I elaborate on at [78] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the circumstances, the second defendant has not been significantly prejudiced in his ability to respond to a claim for loss of chance. The present case more closely resembles <span class="font-italic">Tembusu</span><span class="font-italic"> Growth Fund </span>where the plaintiffs’ loss of chance claim “draws on the same body of evidence adduced at trial”. Accordingly, I hold that the plaintiffs are not barred from recharacterising their loss as a loss of chance. I thus return to the main issue at hand – have the plaintiffs proven their loss?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In their further submissions, the plaintiffs argue that the relevant test for whether a loss of chance has been proven can be found in <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons</span><span class="font-italic"> (a firm)</span> [1995] 1 WLR 1602 (“<span class="font-italic">Allied Maples</span>”) (followed in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd and another</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 661). In <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Stuart-Smith LJ noted that where a plaintiff’s case is that the loss of chance arises out of something that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">himself</span> would otherwise have done, had the defendant not breached his obligations, then the plaintiff must prove this on a balance of probabilities. However, where the plaintiff’s claim depends on the hypothetical actions of a third party, then the plaintiff does not need to prove on a balance of probabilities that the third party would have acted a certain way, but only needs to show that there was a substantial (rather than speculative) chance that the third party would have acted as such (at 1610–1611).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the present case, the plaintiffs claim that they lost the chance to commence and/or prosecute legal action against ASMC expeditiously, which prevented them from obtaining repayment of the sums due under the Contracts in October 2018.

</div> The plaintiffs’ claim thus depends on both the actions of the plaintiffs themselves (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they would have taken/prosecuted legal action if not for the Representations) and the actions of a court hearing any application or proceedings brought by the plaintiffs in October 2018. I therefore agree with the plaintiffs that they have to prove that: (a) on a balance of probabilities, but for the Representations, the plaintiffs would have commenced/prosecuted legal action against ASMC in October 2018; and (b) upon doing so, there was a real or substantial chance that the court hearing the proceedings would have allowed the plaintiffs to recover the full amount due under the Contracts, or part thereof.

</div> Moreover, given the plaintiffs’ claim that they lost the chance to <span class="font-italic">obtain repayment </span>from ASMC, they would also have to show (c) that on a balance of probabilities, they would have enforced any judgment granted against ASMC; and (d) that there was a substantial chance that the plaintiffs would be successful in their enforcement efforts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In my judgment, the plaintiffs have failed to discharge this burden of proof. Let me explain why I have come to this conclusion. As I have noted above at [52], there is no evidence before me to suggest that the plaintiffs were ready to commence legal proceedings in October 2018, and Mr Lun conceded as much in oral closing submissions. Neither have the plaintiffs adduced any evidence on whether there is a real or substantial chance that they would have been granted judgment for any proceedings commenced in October 2018, and if so, that they would have successfully enforced such a judgment against ASMC. The plaintiffs assert in their further submissions that they “would have recovered the full amount [they were] entitled to under the [Contracts]” as ASMC’s financials were in “good health” from October 2018 to September 2019.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This submission is problematic for a number of reasons. First, as I have noted above at [41], it suggests that the Third Representation is <span class="font-italic">true</span> and therefore contradicts the plaintiffs’ case that this representation by the second defendant constitutes a misrepresentation. Second, the plaintiffs did not in any case adduce any evidence on the state of ASMC’s financial health during the material time and in fact, throughout the course of the trial, appeared to <span class="font-italic">dispute</span> that ASMC was in good financial health at the material time. This vacillation on the part of the plaintiffs only serves to accentuate the difficulties with their case against the second defendant. Moreover, the fact that the first plaintiff obtained summary judgment against ASMC in HC/S 189/2019 on 6 December 2019, but has not enforced this judgment to date, casts doubt on the suggestion that the plaintiffs would have expeditiously enforced any judgment obtained against ASMC by way of proceedings commenced in October 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 As noted at [73] above, the second defendant also raises a potentially interesting point on whether the plaintiffs’ loss should properly be characterised as the <span class="font-italic">difference </span>between the sum that the plaintiffs would have recovered via proceedings commenced in October 2018, and the sum that the plaintiffs would recover by taking action later. Had the plaintiffs proven that they would in fact have commenced legal proceedings in October 2018 but for the Representations, I would have considered this point to be potentially relevant in assessing the sum of damages that the plaintiffs are entitled to. However, given that the plaintiffs have failed to prove their loss, this point has been rendered academic and I say nothing more about it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In sum, I find that the plaintiffs have not proven that they suffered any loss as a result of reliance on the Representations. Accordingly, in addition to my conclusions at [32] and [65] above, this forms a further basis for my decision to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims in fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs have not proven that the second defendant knew the Representations were wilfully false </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is not strictly necessary for me to deal with the remaining elements of the claim for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. Nonetheless, for completeness, I make some observations about the final element of the plaintiffs’ claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, which is that the second defendant made the Representations in the knowledge that they were wilfully false, or in the absence of a genuine belief that they were true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my judgment, the plaintiffs have also not established this element of their claim on a balance of probabilities. I have accepted the second defendant’s evidence (see [40] above) that he genuinely believed the truth of the Representations at the material time; it therefore follows that the second defendant did not make the Representations in the knowledge they were wilfully false. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In addition, I am unpersuaded by the plaintiffs’ arguments that the Representations must have been made by the second defendant fraudulently. One of the key arguments advanced by the plaintiffs is that an adverse inference should be drawn from the second defendant’s failure to disclose the following bank statements, despite an order for discovery (granted by consent in HC/ORC 6308/2020) ordering their production:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) bank statements for the DBS Account (referenced above at [33]) for the months of May 2017 to February 2019 and October 2019 to December 2019;

I stress that the plaintiffs’ case against the second defendant for fraudulent misrepresentation (and indeed, for unlawful means conspiracy, as I have noted at [15] above) hinges<span class="font-italic"> </span>on their allegations that the second defendant had knowingly helped to dissipate funds from ASMC by giving false hopes or reassurances to investors like the plaintiffs to induce them to forbear from taking legal action. If, as the plaintiffs claim, the account statements for the DBS Account and Second DBS Account are the so-called “smoking gun” that would prove the alleged dissipation of funds from ASMC, I would have expected the plaintiffs to utilise all the procedural weaponry available to them in their legal arsenal, including applying for discovery against DBS to obtain disclosure of the relevant bank statements. Yet, notwithstanding that it was apparent from at least February 2021 that the defendants faced difficulties disclosing the bank statements (or, based on the plaintiffs’ own case, that the second defendant refused to disclose them), and despite several hints by this court during the trial,

Based on the circumstances set out above, I do not find it appropriate to permit the plaintiffs to prove their case by the drawing of an adverse inference, when the plaintiffs themselves have not attempted to obtain the crucial piece of evidence they (allegedly) need to discharge their evidential and legal burden of proof.

</div> In the circumstances, I find that the BOV Screenshot does not carry much probative value, let alone prove the plaintiffs’ pleaded allegation that the first and second defendants caused the BOV Screenshot to be disseminated to the second plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In any case, even if ASMC had successfully transferred funds from Malta to Singapore, the plaintiffs have also not established that these funds were “dissipated” in the sense that they were applied to an improper purpose (and not to legitimate business expenses). For example, the plaintiffs’ pleaded case (see [15] above] is that part of the objective of the fraudulent scheme was to allow ASMC’s funds to be paid to <span class="font-italic">other</span> investors – implicit in that objection was that these other investors were paid <span class="font-italic">instead</span> of the plaintiffs. Yet there is nothing in the evidence before me to suggest that the plaintiffs were entitled to expect to be paid before or instead of any other investors. It is not the plaintiffs’ case that the second defendant (or the first defendant, for that matter) represented to the plaintiffs that they would be accorded any priority or preference in terms of being paid from any incoming funds that may have been forthcoming. I therefore disagree that the funds must necessarily have been dissipated, simply because ASMC stopped repaying its funders or because other funders may have been paid instead of the plaintiffs. Similarly, in so far as the plaintiffs have pleaded that the funds were dissipated from ASMC and paid to the second defendant <span class="font-italic">personally</span>, no evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs to make good this assertion that the second defendant had received any moneys improperly.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Moreover, even if the plaintiffs had established that moneys were <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>improperly dissipated from ASMC, the question that remains is whether the second defendant had combined or reached an <span class="font-italic">agreement </span>with the first defendant to dissipate money from ASMC. Based on the events described above at [94], I cannot see how this sequence of events alone necessarily shows that the first and second defendants had agreed to dissipate funds from ASMC. The overall picture that emerges from the evidence adduced at trial simply does not match the pleaded conspiracy scenario painted by the plaintiffs, as summarised in their Statement of Claim (see [15] above). Further, in so far as the plaintiffs rely on (a) the Representations; (b) the 1 August 2019 e-mails; and (c) the 2 September 2019 e-mail as instances where the second defendant made false statements to allay the plaintiffs’ suspicions, I accept the second defendant’s defence that he was simply acting on the instructions of his superiors in conveying these representations for the reasons stated at [39]–[40] above.

</div>
</div> Thus, even if I were to assume that funds <span class="font-italic">had </span>been improperly dissipated from ASMC, the fact that the second defendant made representations to the plaintiffs on various occasions does not, in my view, go to show that he was party to an unlawful agreement or that he acted unlawfully in combination with the first defendant to dissipate funds from ASMC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For similar reasons, I find it to be of limited relevance whether ASMC in fact had underlying investments. The plaintiffs allege that ASMC’s underlying investments must have been “bogus”, as limited documentation evidencing ASMC’s sale and purchase of steam coal and nickel was disclosed in the present suit.

</div> Even if it is indeed established that ASMC’s underlying investments are non-existent (although, to be clear, I make no finding on this), this alone does not prove that the second defendant had combined with the first defendant to injure the plaintiffs. On the contrary, the second defendant testified that he had always believed that ASMC was a legitimate business. He had gone on a “due diligence” trip to Indonesia at the start of his employment with ASMC, where he visited a nickel mine with other sales representatives and funders.

</div> The second defendant’s testimony in this respect is uncontradicted and I see no reason to doubt his explanation. I also note that it was not part of the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that ASMC had no underlying investments – in any case, it would be difficult to sustain such a case since the plaintiffs concede that they did receive their monthly payments timeously until about September 2018 when the payments stopped. I therefore decline to place any significant weight on the contention that the second defendant has not adduced evidence of ASMC’s underlying investments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For completeness, I note that the second plaintiff alleges in his AEIC that the conspiracy between the first and second defendants is also evidenced by a message emanating from Dr Smuts.

This message was <span class="font-italic">not </span>posted by Dr Smuts directly to the Whatsapp chat group, but was rather posted by one Mr Stuart Smith, who was sharing with the chat group members an exchange he purportedly had with Dr Smuts over the LinkedIn portal. The plaintiffs did not call Dr Smuts or Mr Stuart Smith as witnesses at the trial. The fact that Dr Smuts may have said that moneys were “squirrelled” away is clearly hearsay evidence, and <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inadmissible for present purposes. Even if it were admissible, I do not see how the message sent by Dr Smuts necessarily demonstrates a conspiracy between the first and second defendants, especially since Dr Smuts does not even mention the second defendant in his message.

To the extent that the plaintiffs allege that the second defendant is wilfully withholding disclosure of bank statements to conceal the defendants’ dissipation of ASMC’s funds, I have already explained at [86] above why I decline to draw any adverse inference in the present case.

</div>
</div> In my view, I do not see how the phrasing of the second defendant’s e-mails alone can prove malice on his part. This is especially so when, as I have accepted at [39] above, these e-mails were sent on instructions from the second defendant’s superiors and at times, drafted by persons <span class="font-italic">other </span>than the second defendant. I have also found that the plaintiffs have not proven that the e-mails sent by the second defendant contained false representations (at [32] above). Accordingly, I disagree that any intent to cause injury can be discerned from the e-mails sent by the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As for the loss allegedly suffered by the plaintiffs, I note that the plaintiffs have not specified anywhere in their pleadings or closing submissions <span class="font-italic">what </span>relief is sought in respect of their claim for unlawful means conspiracy. In any case, proceeding on the assumption that the relief sought by the plaintiffs is the sum of S$616,700 owed by ASMC under the Contracts, the plaintiffs would then have to prove that they had been deprived of the full sum due to them under the Contracts, <span class="font-italic">as a result of</span> the conspiracy to dissipate ASMC’s funds. This would require the plaintiffs to show, for instance, that ASMC would have had sufficient funds to make payment to the plaintiffs pursuant to the Contracts, but for the dissipation of funds. The plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence in this respect. Accordingly, I find that the plaintiffs have also failed to prove that they suffered a loss as a result of the alleged conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In sum, in addition to my conclusion at [101] above, the plaintiffs have not established that the second defendant intended to injure them, or that they suffered a loss as a result of the alleged conspiracy.

This claim can be dealt with in fairly short order. Apart from the fact that the pleaded relief is somewhat incomprehensible (see [16] above), the plaintiffs have not led any evidence, made any submissions or otherwise demonstrated why they are entitled to claim the BNP Paribas Performance Bond from the second defendant. As I mentioned above, this part of the claim was not pursued with any vigour nor articulated in any way. To the extent that the plaintiffs allege that the second defendant fraudulently and/or negligently misrepresented in his e-mail of 12 December 2018 (S/N 7 of <span class="font-weight-bold">Annex A</span>) that ASMC would be procuring a performance bond from BNP Paribas, I have already dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims for misrepresentation at [79] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I find that there is no basis in law or fact to allow this claim and therefore also dismiss it accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 ASMC has effectively ceased operations and is clearly in a financially parlous state.

Therefore, as a result of the said breach of confidentiality we were unable to meet those timeframes. Since that time, the company has had to rearrange the transfer of funds through Indonesia, which unfortunately incurred more administrative costs. These unexpected delays/costs have also compounded ASMC's problems and subsequently further delayed payments whilst we rectify the breach of confidentiality issue in Malta.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">However, we now have funds awaiting clearance into our Singapore account. The transfer is from our nominated business account in Indonesia. The transfer instructions have been sent and we do not anticipate any further problems as clearance has been approved on both countries. The transfer of foreign currency takes a little longer than initially anticipated but we are confident that the funds will clear in due course subject to banking regulatory and administrative requirements. The delays have caused problems for all parties, including clients, agents and ASMC. Once the first transfer clears we can then settle some immediate payments and we can also begin to settle what we owe to clients.
