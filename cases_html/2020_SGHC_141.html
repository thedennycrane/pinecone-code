The Tribunal also found that the minutes recorded the 1st Plaintiff’s clear acceptance that the outstanding requirements had been met. By its acceptance that the outstanding issues had been resolved, the Tribunal found that the 1st Plaintiff had also given its approval for the second launch.

It is clear from the affidavit filed by the Plaintiffs in support of the Stay Application that they were only seeking a stay or adjournment of enforcement proceedings until OS 1307/2019 was heard and determined at first instance.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The legal principles governing a stay of execution pending appeal have been pithily summarised by Justice Quentin Loh in <span class="font-italic">Strandore</span><span class="font-italic"> Invest A/S and others v Soh Kim Wat </span>[2010] SGHC 174 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Strandore Invest”</span>) at [7], referencing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction”</span>), as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) While the court has the power to grant a stay, and this is entirely at the discretion of the court, the discretion must be exercised judicially, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>in accordance with well-established principles.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The first principle is that, as a general proposition, the court does not deprive a successful litigant of the fruits of his litigation, and lock up funds to which he is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>entitled, pending an appeal. There is no difference whether the judgment appealed against was made on a summary basis or after a full trial.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) This is balanced by the second principle. When a party is exercising his undoubted right of appeal, the court ought to see that the appeal, if successful, is not nugatory. Thus a stay will be granted if it can be shown by affidavit that, if the damages and costs are paid, there is no reasonable probability of getting them back if the appeal succeeds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The third principle follows, and is an elaboration of the second principle, that an appellant must show special circumstances before the court will grant a stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Strandore</span><span class="font-italic"> Invest</span>, Loh J<span class="font-italic"> </span>elaborated on the abovementioned principles in the following terms (at [7]): </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">All other rules follow and are derived from the application of these three principles to the individual circumstances and facts of each case. For example, the likelihood of success is not by itself sufficient, and a bald assertion of the likelihood of success in an affidavit is inadequate. Otherwise, a stay would be granted in every case because every appellant must expect that his appeal will succeed. Finally, it is neither possible, nor desirable, to give a catalogue of all the circumstances that would qualify to be considered as special. The court in every case will have to examine the facts to see if special circumstances justifying the grant of a stay of execution exist based upon the application of the three principles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Strandore</span><span class="font-italic"> Invest</span>, the respondent applied for a stay of execution pending its appeal against the High Court’s decision to grant the applicants leave to enforce a foreign arbitral award. <span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction </span>involved an application for a stay of execution pending an appeal against the lower court’s decision to grant summary judgment. Neither case involved a stay on terms similar to the Stay Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 What, then, are the principles that should be applied when the court considers an application by an award debtor to (a) temporarily stay an order granting leave to the award creditor to enforce the award in its favour and/or (b) stay the various enforcement proceedings prosecuted by the award creditor, pending the court hearing and disposing of the award debtor’s setting aside application?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, conceptually, it is logical that the principles governing applications for stay of execution of judgments or orders pending appeal should also generally be applicable to the more limited type of stay application mentioned at [38] above. In substance, similar considerations arise in both situations: the court seeks, on the one hand, to balance the interests of a successful judgment (or award) creditor in enjoying the fruits of its litigation (or arbitration as the case may be), and on the other, the interests of a judgment (or award) debtor such that the appeal (or setting aside application), if successful, is not rendered nugatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Man Diesel T</span><span class="font-italic">urbo SE v IM Skaugen Marine Services Pte Ltd </span>[2019] 4 SLR 537 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Man Diesel Turbo</span>”) alluded to this similarity in the applicable legal principles. In <span class="font-italic">Man Diesel Turbo</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Man Diesel Turbo obtained leave of the Singapore High Court <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>to enforce an arbitral award issued in arbitration proceedings prosecuted in Denmark. IM Skaugen sought to challenge the enforcement of the award and sought, as an alternative prayer, to adjourn enforcement of the award pending the determination of its application to set aside the award which had been filed in the Danish courts. The High Court stated at [37] in relation to s 31(5) of the Act (which applies to enforcement of a foreign award) that:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… Significantly, after a judgment on the foreign award is affirmed, the enforcing court has no power to adjourn under s 31(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic">. </span>After entry of judgment, the judgment is much like any other judgment rendered by the court and the plaintiff would seek an execution order. <span class="font-italic">The other party seeking a stay of the execution order would have to turn to the procedural principles of stay of execution of a civil judgment. </span>[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Although <span class="font-italic">Man Diesel Turbo </span>was a case concerning enforcement of a foreign award, the procedure to enforce a foreign award is largely the same as that which applies to domestic international awards (see <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide </span>(Sundaresh Menon CJ <span class="font-italic">et al</span>) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd ed, 2018) at para 14.042). Section 19 of the Act provides that “an award on an arbitration agreement may, by leave of the High Court or a Judge thereof, be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or an order to the same effect and, where leave is so given, judgment may be entered in terms of the award”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Reverting to the facts of this case, as the Plaintiffs did not, in OS 1124/2019, apply to set aside the Leave Order, it became final after 14 days following service of the Leave Order upon the Plaintiffs.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, the legal principles that apply when a stay of execution of a judgment or order is sought pending appeal would, therefore, also apply to the Stay Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 My conclusion at [42] above finds support in the Hong Kong decision of <span class="font-italic">Israel Sorin (Izzy) </span><span class="font-italic">Shohat v Balram Chainrai</span> [2017] 6 HKC 174. The Hong Kong Court of First Instance held that the court had the discretion to grant a stay of an enforcement order, which enabled an arbitral award to be enforced in Hong Kong in the same manner as a judgment of the court (at [14]). The arbitral award would be given the same effect as a judgment, and the enforcement of the award would therefore be “subject to the same regime governing the stay of execution of an ordinary judgment” (at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 A similar analysis was adopted by the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">BSG Resources Ltd v Vale SA and others </span>[2019] EWHC 2456 (Comm) (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">BSG Resources”</span>). In <span class="font-italic">BSG Resources</span>, an order was granted to Vale SA by the English High Court under section 66 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) for leave to enforce an arbitral award. Subsequently, BSG Resources applied to challenge the award. Prior to the hearing of the challenge application, BSG Resources applied, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, to stay enforcement of the award. The court held that it had the power to grant a stay of enforcement, and considered that there were two lines of case authorities setting out the principles which a court could take into account in exercising its discretion to grant a stay. In that particular case, either set of principles would lead to the same outcome (at [54] and [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The first line of authority was found in <span class="font-italic">Far East Shipping v AKP </span><span class="font-italic">Sovcomflot </span>[1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 520 (which was also cited in <span class="font-italic">Strandore</span><span class="font-italic"> Invest </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [16]). In that case, Potter J noted that, having elected to convert an award into an English judgment, the plaintiff ought in principle to be subject to the same procedural rules and conditions as generally apply to the enforcement of such judgments (see <span class="font-italic">BSG Resources </span>at [50]). The second line of authority was found in <span class="font-italic">Socadec</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Pan Afric Impex Co </span>[2003] EWHC 2086 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Socadec</span>”), where the English court held that the principles which a judge should apply were (a) firstly, the strength of the argument that the award was invalid, assessed on a “brief consideration” and not a mini trial; and (b) secondly, the ease or difficulty of the enforcement of the award and whether if enforcement was withheld or delayed it could become more difficult by the movement of assets, problems of trading, disappearance of the defendant (see <span class="font-italic">BSG Resources</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In light of the authorities referred to above, I am of the view that once the Leave Order was made final, any application for a stay of execution of that order (and of any enforcement proceedings flowing from that order) would be subject to the same legal principles as those which govern an application to stay the execution of a court judgment or order pending appeal. In substance, the various prayers in the Stay Application seek to achieve the same overarching outcome, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>to stay the enforcement of the Award which the Defendant could now enforce by virtue of the Leave Order granted to it.  Finally, as the court has a discretion and should consider all relevant circumstances in an application of this nature, the factors set out at <span class="font-italic">Socadec</span> are also, in my opinion, useful and relevant factors that should be thrown into the mix. Those factors can be comfortably considered within the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Strandore</span><span class="font-italic"> Invest</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Returning to the case at hand, the Defendant pointed out that the following factors militated against the grant of a stay. First, there was no evidence that the Defendant would be unable to return the monies paid to it under the Award. On the contrary, the Defendant was a shipyard of means. Second, the Plaintiffs have displayed conduct that showed its attempts to delay and frustrate the enforcement of the Award. This included the fact that the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs had not paid the sums awarded to the Defendant under that part of the Award concerning the Contract Y claim which was not being challenged. Third, there were no special circumstances present to justify granting a stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As for the Plaintiffs, their supporting affidavit contained a bare assertion that if a stay was refused prior to the disposal of OS 1307/2019 or if the Stay Application was only to be heard at the same time as OS 1307/2019, it would render a successful outcome in OS 1307/2019 nugatory (see [31] above).

</div> It was also contended by the Plaintiffs that the Tribunal, in arriving at its conclusion that the condition precedent for the launch had been met, in effect found that the 1st Plaintiff had given its approval on 28 April 2015 for the launch of Hull No. X and then transposed that approval as retrospective consent to the earlier launch that had taken place on 20 January 2015.

</div>
</div> When all of the pleadings are considered compendiously, both parties were, in my view, aware that the issue of whether approval had been given by the 1st Plaintiff prior to and for the second launch on 3 May 2015 was in play. I elaborate below and start with the Plaintiff’s Statement of Defence and Counterclaim (“SDC”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As early as the SDC, the Plaintiffs themselves had already made various references to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the first and second launches and denied that the 1st Plaintiff had given its approval to <span class="font-italic">either</span> launch. This was despite the fact that in the Statement of Claim, the Defendant had only pleaded the <span class="font-italic">first</span> launch as part of its case on compliance with the conditions precedent in Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2. This was, to my mind, a clear indication that the Plaintiffs were, from very early on, alive to the relevance of the second launch and the Construction and Progress Meetings that preceded it. Indeed, it appeared to me that the Plaintiffs were seeking to pre-empt the Defendant. I reproduce the relevant parts of the SDC below:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48. It is important to emphasize the terms relating to payment of the fourth instalment by [the 1st Plaintiff]. Article 5 of the Contracts Addendum No. 2 provided that the fourth instalment shall be paid upon launch and upon receipt of invoice issued by the [Defendant]. However, more importantly, it was further provided that the launch was subject to the [Defendant’s] compliance with [Contract X] with regards to the quality of workmanship and system, and the prior approval by CLASS, [the  1st Plaintiff], and the [Defendant] <span class="font-weight-bold">collectively</span>. <span class="font-italic">No approval was granted by [the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Plaintiff] on 20 January 2015, or at all.</span> In the premises, [the 1st Plaintiff] did not become and is not liable to the [Defendant] for the alleged sum of US$13.9 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50. <span class="font-italic">Prior to the alleged 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Launch, and on 20 January 2015 itself, being the date of the alleged launch</span>, [the 1st Plaintiff] had made it known to the [Defendant] that [the 1st Plaintiff] did not agree and/or consider [Hull No. X] to be ready for the launch. <span class="font-italic">It is and was therefore [the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Plaintiff’s] position that the [Defendant] did not launch [Hull No. X] in accordance with the terms of [Contract X] on 20 January 2015, or at all</span> to quantify for the fourth instalment, being 10% of the contract price. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53. The [Defendant] had agreed to make the necessary modifications and/or rectifications to [Hull No. X], <span class="font-italic">and</span><span class="font-italic"> had subsequently arranged for a launch to take place on 3 May 2015 (the “2nd Launch”)</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">[RBOD Vol 2 Page 481]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54. <span class="font-italic">Despite the [Defendant’s]</span><span class="font-italic"> attempt at the 2nd Launch, [the 1st Plaintiff] was still not satisfied with the quality and workmanship of the construction of [Hull No. X], and still did not consider the launch to have been effectively carried out. Numerous Non-Conformance Reports and Punch Lists were still outstanding, and the defects had not been rectified by the [Defendant] as at 20 January 2015 and/or 3 May 2015, or at all.</span> <span class="font-italic">It was therefore unacceptable for the [Defendant] to proceed for the launch of [Hull No. X], and inconceivable for the [Defendant] to believe that [the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Plaintiff] agreed to the same.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55.  Given that the Contracts Addendum No. 2 clearly stipulates that payment of the fourth instalment is subject to the quality of workmanship and system being in conformance with [Contract No. X], and the approval by CLASS, [the 1st Plaintiff] and the [Defendant] <span class="font-weight-bold">collectively </span><span class="font-italic">coupled with the fact that [the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Plaintiff] had refused to consider the [Hull No. X]</span> <span class="font-italic">as being launched on 20 January 2015, 3 May 2015, or at all</span>, <span class="font-italic">it is eviden</span><span class="font-italic">t that [the 1st Plaintiff] is not obliged to make payment for the fourth instalment, and any demand made for the same by the [Defendant] was baseless</span>. The [Defendant’s] assertion that the launch was confirmed by American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), on 20 January 2015 is and was flawed as the [Defendant] themselves was aware that the launch on 20 January 2015 was improper and not in accordance with the General Specifications and/or terms of [Contract X], <span class="font-italic">as they had attempted to carry out the necessary modifications to rectify the defects, and had attempted to perform a second launch on 3 May 2015. </span>If they had truly considered [the 1st Plaintiff] to be bound by the alleged 1st Launch on 20 January 2015, the [Defendant] would not have taken steps to rectify the defects found and/or made steps to prepare for the 2nd Launch. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56. The [Defendant] did not launch [Hull No. X] in accordance with the terms of [Contract X], which required the consent of [the 1st Plaintiff], <span class="font-italic">on 20 January 2015 or at all</span> to qualify for the fourth instalment, being 10% of the contract price. It was a clear contingent precedent that was not met by the [Defendant] and for this reason alone, their claim should be dismissed. It also bears mentioning that incredulously the [Defendant] failed to paint [Hull No. X] in accordance with the General Specifications before launching; its bare steel hull was launched into water. This, amongst other factors, rendered [Hull No. X] unfit for launch at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in bold, emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 From the paragraphs in the SDC quoted above, it was apparent that the Plaintiffs themselves were alive, at a very early stage in the Arbitration, to the relevance and significance of the Construction and Progress Meetings following the first launch on 20 January 2015, and of the second launch on 3 May 2015. In proactively addressing those issues in the SDC, the Plaintiffs were, in my judgment, clearly aware that they were very much a central part of the dispute. By their own pleadings, the Plaintiffs had placed these issues in the arena. Therefore, based on just the SDC, it was clear to me that those issues were before the Tribunal and would need to be considered and decided by it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I next considered the Defendant’s Statement of Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (“SRDC”). In the SRDC, the Defendant pleaded that the launch of Hull No. X had been successfully completed on 20 January 2015, and in any event, the Defendant had resolved all outstanding issues in relation to the launch by May 2015.

I reproduce below the relevant paragraphs of the Rejoinder that demonstrate this: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">70. The [Defendant]’s understanding that by 28 April 2015, parties had reached an understanding that all outstanding issues related to [Hull No. X]’s launch were resolved, and that they managed to resolve the outstanding issues highlighted by [the 1st Plaintiff] in relation to [Hull No. X]’s launch meant that they were entitled to payment of the 4th instalment is entirely misconceived. The [Plaintiffs] had at no point in time, limited the launch to the outstanding issues raised and expounded in paragraph 68 above, for the reasons set out below. The [Defendant] is here attempting to re-write the terms of the launch as agreed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">76. In any event, it was merely agreed from a technical perspective that the following outstanding issues raised were to be completed prior to [Hull No. X] being considered [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] <span class="font-italic">launching condition</span>, instead of <span class="font-italic">floating condition</span>. There was no agreement and/or understanding reached between the technical teams at the meeting that [Hull No. X] <span class="font-weight-bold">would be validly launched after the outstanding issues were resolved</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> The project managers who had attended the meetings, had at no point in time ever represented that the launch would be successful, and/or that the [Defendant] would obtain the [Plaintiffs’] approval after the outstanding issues raised at the meeting on 21 January 2015 were closed. The minutes of meeting merely provided that the remaining items must be completed prior to [Hull No. X] being considered to be in a “<span class="font-italic">launching condition</span>”. In no way did the [Plaintiffs’] Supervisors and/or the [Plaintiffs] agree that [Hull No. X] was in fact to be considered launched once aforesaid defects had been rectified or closed. The [Defendant’s] understanding was and is clearly misconceived. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">77. In addition, the simple fact of the matter remains that the [Defendant] had not, as at the date of the repudiation of the Contract, obtained the [Plaintiffs’] prior approval for the launch of [Hull No. X], and/or met the conditions precedents set out in Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As can be seen from the paragraphs quoted above, the Plaintiffs sought to undermine the importance of the Construction and Progress Meetings. The Plaintiffs argued that they had not limited their withholding of approval for the launch to only the outstanding issues stated in the meeting minutes. They also contended that the meeting on 28 April 2015 was merely a technical one (as opposed to a meeting attended by representatives with authority to make binding representations) such that any decisions or agreements reached at that meeting were not binding on the Plaintiffs.

</div> The SRDC stated this position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Further, from the SDC and Rejoinder which I have referred to above, the Plaintiffs were undoubtedly alive, not just to the relevance of the meeting on 28 April 2015 and the second launch on 3 May 2015, but to their contractual relevance as conditions precedent to be met by the Defendant under Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2. Thus, by the time the parties had served <span class="font-italic">all</span> of their pleadings, the battle lines in relation to both the first and second launches and the Construction and Progress Meetings had been clearly drawn. Therefore, the Tribunal was in a position, legitimately, to decide whether the conditions precedent in Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2 were met prior to the second launch of Hull No. X on 3 May 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Considering all of the pleadings submitted by the parties in the Arbitration compendiously, the Tribunal did, in my judgment, act within the scope of submission and did not exceed its jurisdiction in the Award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The ALOI</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 My conclusion at [74] above based on the parties’ pleadings was fortified when I considered the ALOI.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In my view, based on the ALOI and the sub-issues enumerated by the parties under Issues 1, 2 and 3, whether Hull No. X was launched on 20 January 2015 or on 3 May 2015 and whether, <span class="font-italic">prior to each of these launch</span><span class="font-italic"> dates</span>, the 1st Plaintiff’s approval had been obtained were clearly placed by the parties as issues to be decided by the Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal’s finding that on 28 April 2015, the 1st Plaintiff had approved the second launch cannot be said to be new, irrelevant or outside the scope of submission.  Similarly, whether Hull No. X was or was not launched with the 1st Plaintiff’s approval on 20 January 2015 or 3 May 2015 was also not a new or irrelevant issue and did not fall outside the scope of submission either. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the scope of submission objection </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the circumstances, having considered all the pleadings filed by both parties in the Arbitration (following <span class="font-italic">PT Prima</span> ([60] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [33]–[34]) and the ALOI (following <span class="font-italic">GD </span><span class="font-italic">Midea</span> ([61] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [43]), I found that the Tribunal was acting well within the scope of submission to arbitration.

The first is that an arbitral tribunal was biased against a party thereby contravening the rule of equality of treatment of the parties. The second facet is commonly referred to as the fair hearing rule, encapsulated in the well-known Latin maxim <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span>. When the fair hearing rule is invoked, the aggrieved party’s complaint is that it was not given a fair or reasonable opportunity to be heard or to otherwise present its case. The fair hearing rule forms the second ground of objection relied on by the Plaintiffs in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86  In relation to the fair hearing rule, the Court of Appeal, in its oft-cited decision in <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span>, held that parties have, in general, a right to be heard and an arbitrator “should not base his decision(s) on matters not submitted or argued before him”. In other words, the arbitrator “should not make bricks without straw” (at [65(a)]). In essence, an arbitral tribunal should not surprise the parties with its own ideas (at [44]). However, consistent with the policy of limited curial intervention, the courts should only intervene in arbitral awards in limited circumstances. For example, where the “impugned decision reveals a dramatic departure from the submissions, or involves an arbitrator receiving extraneous evidence, or adopts a view wholly at odds with the established evidence adduced by the parties or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by the parties as being trivial or irrelevant” (at [65(c)–(d)]). Whilst a tribunal should not make bricks without straw, where the factual basis or “building blocks” of the award were present during the arbitral proceedings, it cannot be said that a tribunal reached its own conclusions in breach of natural justice (at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In addition, a particular chain of reasoning would be open to a tribunal, even if not specifically argued by the parties, if it flows reasonably from a premise argued or actually advanced by either party (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 (<span class="font-italic">“TMM</span><span class="font-italic"> Division”</span>) at [65]). Finally, it is also a well-entrenched principle that the court will not set aside an award under the Act simply because an arbitrator made an error of law or of fact. The court should not allow an aggrieved party a second bite of the cherry by engaging the court on what is, in substance, an appeal on the legal merits of the arbitral award disguised as a breach of natural justice challenge (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span><span class="font-italic">and another v ALC and others and other appeals</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488 at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application and analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The complaints of the Plaintiffs here were, save for some additional objections summarised at [112] below, largely similar to those raised in relation to the scope of submission objection which I considered earlier in these grounds and dismissed. For similar reasons, I was of the view that the Plaintiffs’ objections were without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The record of the Arbitration shows that the Plaintiffs were aware of the Defendant’s case and had, not just reasonable, but ample opportunity to respond to it. Further, the Tribunal’s reasoning and decision in the Award were based on the issues placed before it and arguments advanced by the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 With regard to the pleadings and the ALOI, I have already discussed this at length (at [65]–[80] above) and do not propose to say any more than I already have. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Apart from the pleadings and the ALOI, I also considered the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Opening Statements and the conduct of the case by the Plaintiffs in the course of the Arbitration (including the evidence adduced during the oral hearing). When all of these were viewed in the round, it was clear to me that the Plaintiffs were keenly aware that the Defendant was also putting forward a position that approval had been obtained from the 1st Plaintiff on or by 28 April 2015 such that a qualifying launch pursuant to Article 6(d) of the Contracts Addendum No. 2 had taken place when the second launch occurred on 3 May 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Mr Singh accepted, during the hearing before me, that by the time the Defendant had filed its Opening Statement, the Defendant had made known its position, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> that an agreement or understanding had been reached on 28 April 2015 for the launch on 3 May 2015.

As such, the Plaintiffs asserted that the Defendant could not claim that all outstanding matters relating to the launch were resolved in May 2015.

On its part, the Tribunal met the parties’ competing arguments head-on and dealt with them as it was entitled to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In my view, all of the factual “building blocks” for the Tribunal’s findings and its decision were clearly very much in play, having been placed before it in the parties’ pleadings, in the ALOI and during the oral hearing. The Plaintiffs were sensitised to the Defendant’s arguments and were well aware where the battle lines lay in relation to both launches and the Construction and Progress Meetings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In my judgment, it could hardly be said that in this case, the Tribunal made bricks without straw. On the contrary, it is clear that the Tribunal did so with solid raw materials that were laid out before it during the course of the Arbitration by both parties.  This was also not a case where one could conclude that the Tribunal had “conjured up facts or reached a view inconsistent with the facts presented.” (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span> ([84] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67]). Neither was this a case where the Tribunal’s decision could be said to involve a dramatic departure from the parties’ submissions, or to be at odds with the established evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Furthermore, given that the parties had traversed the facts and evidence pertaining to both launches, the Construction and Progress Meetings and whether the 1st Plaintiff had given its prior approval to either launch, the Tribunal’s reasoning and conclusion, at the very least, reasonably flowed from the arguments that were advanced by the parties in their closing submissions. For this reason also, there was, in my view, no need for the Tribunal to have notified the parties of its thinking or invited further submissions from them (see <span class="font-italic">TMM</span><span class="font-italic"> Division</span> ([87] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I turn now to deal with a slightly different aspect of the Plaintiffs’ case on breach of natural justice. As can be seen from the discussion above, the nub of the Plaintiffs’ complaint was that the Tribunal’s decision significantly departed from the Defendant’s case pleaded before it.  In substance, the Plaintiffs’ argument was as follows (see [62] above) – that the Tribunal had, in effect, transposed the approval which it found had been given by the 1st Plaintiff on 28 April 2015 <span class="font-italic">to an earlier time</span>, to reach the conclusion that the condition precedent was satisfied when Hull No. X was launched on 20 January 2015. The Plaintiffs argued that this must be the conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal since the Defendant’s entire pleaded case hinged only on the first launch date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 According to the Plaintiffs, this conclusion of “retrospective approval” having been given by the 1st Plaintiff would amount to rewriting the contract terms since under Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2, approval by the 1st Plaintiff had to be given <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the launch of Hull No. X. If, the Plaintiffs argued, the Tribunal was going down the path of reasoning as described at [101] above, it should have given the parties (or at least the Plaintiffs) notice of its thinking in order to afford them the opportunity to respond, both in terms of evidence and submissions on the law. The Tribunal’s conclusion, so the Plaintiffs contended, was surprising and shocking, and the Plaintiffs were not given any opportunity to respond to it.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The arguments summarised at [100]–[103] above were, in my view, misconceived and involved a misreading of the Award.  I am mindful of the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>([84] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that an award “should be read supportively… [and] given a reading which is likely to uphold it rather than to destroy it.” (at [59], quoting <span class="font-italic">Weldon Plant Ltd v The Commission for the New Towns </span>[2001] 1 All ER (Comm) 264 at [22]). I am also mindful that the court should read an award in a reasonable and commercial way, and not nit-pick at an award (<span class="font-italic">TMM</span><span class="font-italic"> Division </span>at [45], citing <span class="font-italic">Zermalt</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings SA v Nu-Life Upholstery Repairs Ltd </span>[1985] 2 EGLR 14 at [14]).<span class="font-underline"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In this case, it was not necessary for me to give the Award a generous reading. Based on a plain, reasonable reading of the Award in its proper context and bearing in mind all of the pleadings and the ALOI, it was clear that the Tribunal <span class="font-italic">did not</span> make any such finding or arrive at the conclusion as contended by the Plaintiffs at [101] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Tribunal did not hold that the approval given by the 1st Plaintiff on 28 April 2015 satisfied, <span class="font-italic">retrospectively</span>, the condition precedent for the first launch <span class="font-italic">on 20 </span><span class="font-italic">January 2015</span>. From the Tribunal’s analysis, it was amply clear that the Tribunal concluded that the approval given by the 1st Plaintiff on 28 April 2015 was sufficient to satisfy that condition precedent for <span class="font-italic">the second launch</span> of Hull No. X which the parties had agreed (in the minutes of the 28 April 2015 meeting) would take place <span class="font-italic">on 3 </span><span class="font-italic">May 2015</span>. The Tribunal reasoned that a conclusion could be drawn from the minutes placed before it that the 1st Plaintiff had certified Hull No. X as being in “Launching Condition”, and therefore, the 1st Plaintiff had, on 28 April 2015, approved the launch. That launch was to, and did, take place <span class="font-italic">on 3 </span><span class="font-italic">May 2015</span>. The Tribunal then found that by then<span class="font-italic">, </span>the Defendant, 1st Plaintiff and the Classification Society had collectively given their prior approval for that second launch, thereby also fulfilling that condition precedent in Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Minute Sheet (6 February 2020) at p 13 </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I have, at [106] above, quoted the relevant extracts from page 86 of the Award, and specifically, from paragraph 6.9(c)(ii) of the Award which contained the Tribunal’s reasoning and conclusions the Plaintiffs took issue with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Award and the Tribunal’s reasoning in the Award have to be read as a whole. It is abundantly clear to me that the Tribunal in fact found, based on the minutes of the Construction and Progress Meetings, that approval had been given by the 1st Plaintiff on 28 April 2015 for the <span class="font-italic">second</span> launch on 3 May 2015, such that the <span class="font-italic">second</span> launch took place with the requisite prior collective approval of the Defendant, 1st Plaintiff and the Classification Society. Nowhere did the Tribunal find or conclude that the 1st Plaintiffs’ approval on 28 April 2015 constituted its prior approval for the first launch on 20 January 2015. In my view, this entire line of argument by the Plaintiffs completely missed the mark.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 If I required any fortification of the conclusion I reached at [106] above, no clearer statement of the Tribunal’s reasoning could be found than in a later section of the Award when the Tribunal dealt with the Defendant’s claim against the 3rd Plaintiff under the X Guarantee. At paragraph 8.6 of the Award, this is what the Tribunal said:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The [Defendant] sent an invoice to [the 1st Plaintiff] on 7 February 2015. Pursuant to Article 18.9 of [Contract X], this invoice was to be paid within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the invoice, i.e. on or before 24 March 2015. <span class="font-italic">However, as [the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Plaintiff] only gave its approval for the launch of [Hull No. X] on 28 April 2015 which was then launched on 3 May 2015, the conditions for the payment of the Fourth Instalment were only fulfilled on 3 May 2015.</span> On 5 May 2015, the [Defendant] again demanded payment of the Fourth Instalment. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the [Defendant’s] demand of 5 May 2015 for payment of the Fourth Instalment had to be paid within forty-five (45) days of its receipt, i.e. on or before 19 June 2015 (see Article 18.9 of [Contract X]). This notwithstanding, [the 1st Plaintiff] failed to pay the Fourth Instalment when this fell due or any time thereafter. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 There was also no merit in the Plaintiffs’ argument (at [103] above) that the Tribunal did not attempt to understand the issues before it or the arguments advanced. As noted in <span class="font-italic">TMM</span> <span class="font-italic">Division</span> ([87] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [90], the “central inquiry” is “whether the award reflects the fact that the arbitral tribunal <span class="font-italic">had applied its mind</span> to the critical issues and arguments” (emphasis added). On any reading of the Award and from the passages in the Award reproduced at [106] and [109] above, there was no doubt in my mind that the Tribunal did apply its mind to the issues and arguments advanced by the parties pertaining to the first launch, as well as the subsequent events leading up to and including the second launch and their relevance to Article 6(d) of Contracts Addendum No. 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 For all of the reasons above, it rang somewhat hollow, in my view, for the Plaintiffs to now complain that they were taken by surprise by the Tribunal’s findings and decision. It appeared to me that the Plaintiffs’ complaints of breach of natural justice were nothing more than Trojan horses deployed to disguise the Plaintiffs’ attempts to challenge the decision of the Tribunal on its legal merits. This was not permissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The Plaintiffs raised two further, secondary objections in relation to the Award. First, that the Tribunal had found that the Plaintiffs had unreasonably withheld their approval of the launch of Hull No. X, and that the 1st Plaintiff had to be treated as having retrospectively approved the launch on 20 January 2015.

</div> This conclusion was, in my view, subsidiary to and not dispositive of the Tribunal’s decision.

That would be my instructions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">PC: Did you lift this from addendum number 2?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Mr Burthem: I believe this wording would have come from any instructions, actually.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">PC: Does this accord – because you are commenting on the conditions set out in article 6. So I need to ask you, does this accord exactly with what article 6 stays in relation to the conditions?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Mr Burthem: Typically, if I’m making a quote, I would have put it in quotation marks. In this case, the wording, I think, would have come from my instructions, so I can’t say whether the wording exactly accords or not unless you show me a copy of addendum number 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">PC: Apart from your instructions, did you have a look at addendum number 2 yourself?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Mr Burthem: Yes, I confirmed that a moment ago.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">PC: Do you also confirm that you have not addressed all the conditions or addendum number 2 in this paragraph?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">DC: Mr Chairman, I need to object to that question. Mr Burthem is here to give evidence on the technical matters not on the contractual basis for addendum number 2. If the tribunal looks at topic 2, 2(a), you will then see – and that is on page – I’m sorry, it’s topic 2, 2(a) you will then see at 2(a), that as an issue is broken down into further technical issues, 2(a)(i), 2(a)(ii), 2(a)(iii), 2(a)(iv) before it goes into 2(b). <span class="font-italic">Mr</span><span class="font-italic"> Burthem has answered the technical issues in respect of those. Mr Burthem has not responded on whether the conditions set out in article 6 of addendum 2 were complied to, as suggested to by my learned friend, which he can’t because he’s a technical expert</span>. So it’s not really a fair question to suggest that he has – or she [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] should have or he did look at whether the conditions in addendum 2 are satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">PC: I’ll tell you why it’s fair. It’s because of the way the report has been phrased. (i) says generally, without qualification: “Whether the conditions set out in article 6 of addendum number 2 were complied with prior to the launch of [Hull No. X] on 20 January 2015.” So I’m perfectly entitled to ask him whether he’s considered all of the requirements in addendum number 6 (sic) because he has made a general statement on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">DC: Mr Chairman, <span class="font-italic">surely that must be caveated by if you look at what the technical matters are from 1, 2 and 3, and further, I can’t even see how that would be relevant </span><span class="font-italic">since Mr Burthem wasn’t a witness at the time and he’s not a legal expert that can quite actually state what are the conditions in addendum number 2</span>. So even if my learned friend asked these questions, what will the response be? It won’t be useful for this tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Chairman: … Mr Singh (Plaintiffs’ counsel), we’ve conferred. <span class="font-italic">You </span><span class="font-italic">have to restrict your questions to the specific items set out in 2(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I agreed with the Defendant’s submissions. Given the manner in which the Memo was structured, where each party’s appointed expert weighed in on each sub-issue in dispute, it was clear that Mr Burthem was not addressing the general question of whether the conditions set out in Article 6 of Contracts Addendum No. 2 were complied with. Rather, he was responding to each sub-issue in the Memo, as instructed. The Tribunal was not remiss in directing the Plaintiffs’ counsel, in his cross-examination, to keep to the sub-issues and within the remit of the Memo. At the point where the Tribunal intervened, the Plaintiff was, in effect, asking Mr Burthem to interpret Contracts Addendum No. 2. That was not Mr Burthem’s role as a technical expert. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Mr Burthem explained that the contractual and technical requirements could be inter-related, and that he would give his view when a technical standard potentially impacted upon whether a contractual requirement was met. This did not mean that the Plaintiffs should have therefore been given a free hand and allowed to cross-examine Mr Burthem on the contract itself or the interpretation of its terms. Where there were contract terms and technical standards that were linked, they would conceivably be covered under the appropriate listed technical sub-issues in the Memo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It is, in my view, clear that the Plaintiffs were not in any way denied the opportunity to cross-examine Mr Burthem on the issues as stated in the Memo and on paragraph 16(b) of his witness statement. In any event, following the Tribunal’s intervention and its direction to the Plaintiffs’ counsel (see [122]), there was no objection raised by the Plaintiffs and the oral hearing continued.

This ground of the Plaintiffs’ application also failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 As neither ground raised by the Plaintiffs in their application had been made out, I dismissed OS 1307/2019 accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Finally, the Plaintiffs appealed against my cost orders in both OS 1307/2019 and the Stay Application. For both OS 1307/2019 and the Stay Application, as costs should follow the event, I awarded costs to the Defendant on the standard basis. After hearing the parties, I fixed costs for OS 1307/2019 at $13,500 and disbursements at $12,406.25 to be paid by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant. For the Stay Application, I fixed costs at $3,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant.

The second was <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span><span class="font-italic"> International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Fully Best Trading Ltd </span>[2016] 1 HKC 149, where the Hong Kong Court of First Instance stated that the basis of awarding costs on an indemnity basis was that parties had consensually agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration and accept the arbitral award as final and binding on them (at [10]).

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Leaving aside the Hong Kong position, it is indisputable that this court has the discretion to award indemnity costs in appropriate cases. However, as stated by Justice Chan Seng Onn in <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span><span class="font-italic"> (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydaulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 103 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Airtrust”</span>) at [17], an order of costs on an indemnity basis is “the exception rather than the norm and requires justification”. Chan J went on to state at [18] that the starting point to determine whether it would be appropriate to order indemnity costs is O 59 r 5 of the ROC. That rule allowed the court to have regard to, among others, the conduct of the parties before and during the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span> at [23], the following “broad categories of conduct” may provide a basis for ordering indemnity costs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where the action is brought in bad faith, as a means of oppression or for other improper purposes;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where the action is speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) where a party’s conduct in the course of proceedings is dishonest, abusive or improper; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) where the action amounts to wasteful or duplicative litigation or is otherwise an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I was not persuaded that the position on costs adopted in the Hong Kong cases cited at [135] above should represent the default position in Singapore for unsuccessful challenges to arbitral awards. I therefore exercised my discretion in accordance with the guidelines set out in <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 OS 1307/2019 was the first application which the Plaintiffs had taken out. Whilst I found the application unmeritorious, it could not be said to have been made without any basis whatsoever. Nor was it frivolous. There was also no evidence of any improper conduct or bad faith in the Plaintiffs’ conduct of the proceedings. In my view, this was not a case where indemnity costs should be ordered. I therefore awarded costs to the Defendant on the standard basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As for quantum, the Defendant submitted that for OS 1307/2019, costs in the sum of $13,500 were appropriate based on the guidelines set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (“Appendix G”) as the hearing spanned two half-days (effectively, a full-day hearing). As for disbursements, the Defendant tendered to me a breakdown of the total disbursements incurred amounting to $12,406.25. The Defendant submitted that the disbursements included filing fees and that it had to exhibit, in the supporting affidavit, the entire voluminous record of the arbitration proceedings. As the Defendant was based in China, its counsel also had to file a cover affidavit first followed by the actual affidavit by the Defendant’s representative. For the Stay Application, the Defendant submitted that a sum of $4,000 would be appropriate based on the guidelines for stay applications in Appendix G. The parties had also attended various Pre-Trial Conferences in relation to the Stay Application.
