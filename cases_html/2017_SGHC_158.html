See <span class="font-italic">Tania </span><span class="font-italic">Rappo </span>at [71].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It also bears reminding that it is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum; the defendant must establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore: <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [26].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Personal connections of the parties and witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Praxis accepted that this was a neutral factor. In any event, I agreed with the AR this factor did not point to Lebanon being a more appropriate forum.   The documents and Praxis’ witnesses are in Singapore. Praxis is a Singapore company. Best Soar is a BVI company which was managed by a Singapore company. The supply of bunker took place in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Connections to relevant events and transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The key consideration is where the trial could be held at least expense and inconvenience: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws</span>”) at para 75.092. I agreed with the AR that there was insufficient evidence as to how the costs of litigating this matter in Lebanon compared with the costs of litigating in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, another consideration is that where the claim is in tort, as a general principle, the place where a tort was committed is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for that tortious claim: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO </span><span class="font-italic">Minerals</span>”) at [106], citing <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [39]. The Wrongful Arrest Claim is a claim in tort. As the alleged wrongful arrest took place in Lebanon, this pointed to Lebanon being <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for the Wrongful Arrest Claim. In my view, there was nothing to displace this <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> position in this case. The place of the tort was not fortuitous. The arrest was made pursuant to an order issued by the EBB under the laws of Lebanon.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Governing law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The governing law is a relevant connection because in general, the court which will be called on to apply its own law is in a better position to do so: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws </span>at para 75.093. In the present case, it was not disputed that the Wrongful Arrest Claim was to be resolved under Lebanese law and depended in part on the interpretation of the Merchant Shipping Code of Lebanon.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As for the Contract Claim, Best Soar submitted that it was governed by Singapore law whereas Praxis took the position that it was governed by the general maritime law of the United States of America. For purposes of the present stay application, it was not necessary for me to decide whether Singapore law or US law governed the Contract Dispute. Neither one pointed to Lebanon being the more appropriate forum for the Contract Dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">Lis alibi pendens</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 A <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens </span>is relevant to the doctrine of forum election and the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>: <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span> at [29]. It was not disputed that no issue of forum election arose in the present case. In the context of deciding whether a stay should be granted on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, a <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens </span>merely features as one of the factors to be considered by the court. However, it is sufficient that there are parallel proceedings even if these proceedings do not meet the stricter requirements of a <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span>. See <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span> at [38]–[40]. Within the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> framework, parallel proceedings are relevant because of concerns over the duplication of resources and the risk of conflicting judgments: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws</span> at para 75.094. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It was not necessary for me to decide whether the EBB Proceedings and/or the CCB Proceedings constituted <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span>, although it seemed to me that the AR was correct in thinking that they did. In my view, the EBB and CCB Proceedings were parallel proceedings. The question was whether the EBB and CCB Proceedings gave rise to concerns over the duplication of resources and the risk of conflicting judgments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Both parties’ experts agreed that it was the CCB that would make the final determination on the merits of the Contract Claim.

<div class="txt-body text-left">  Josiane Lahoud’s 1st Affidavit dated 12 October 2016, para 10; Zeidan’s 1st Affidavit, paras 12 and 17.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Best Soar submitted that the EBB Proceedings were therefore irrelevant to the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test since the EBB could not make any final determination on the merits of Contract Claim. I disagreed with Best Soar. Best Soar’s submission conveniently ignored the fact that the EBB Proceedings were clearly relevant to the Wrongful Arrest Claim. Best Soar’s case in the EBB Proceedings was that the arrest of the Vessel was wrongful and that Praxis should provide security for damages in the event the arrest was held to be wrongful (see [8] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my view, it was clear that both the EBB and CCB Proceedings were multiple proceedings and that this fact was a relevant factor to be considered under the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test. Both gave rise to concerns over the duplication of resources and the risk of conflicting judgments. The risk of conflicting judgments was especially of concern with respect to the Wrongful Arrest Claim since it concerned the correctness or otherwise of the Arrest Order made by the EBB and this in turn depended in part on Praxis’ entitlement to a maritime lien under the Merchant Shipping Code of Lebanon.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shape of the litigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 This factor refers to the manner in which the claim and defence have been pleaded: <span class="font-italic">Tania </span><span class="font-italic">Rappo </span>at [71]. As already mentioned, Best Soar’s claim in the Singapore Proceedings comprised the Contract Claim and the tortious Wrongful Arrest Claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It seemed to me that there were overlaps between this factor and some of the other factors. However, I also agreed with the AR that the Wrongful Arrest Claim involved considerations of international comity. International comity refers to “the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws”: <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>[2012] 2 SLR 289 at [23]. In my view, considerations of international comity favoured Lebanon as the more appropriate forum for the Wrongful Arrest Claim. The EBB, as the court making the Arrest Order, should be recognised as the more appropriate court to determine whether the arrest was wrongful under Lebanese law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on first stage of the </span>Spiliada<span class="font-italic"> test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As Best Soar submitted, the case should be looked at holistically. It is the quality, rather than the quantity, of the connecting factors that is crucial in this analysis and the search is for connections that have the “most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute”: <span class="font-italic">Tania </span><span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> at [70]. Ultimately, the question is whether any of the connections point towards a jurisdiction in which the case may be “tried more suitable for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice”: <span class="font-italic">Tania </span><span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> at [72], quoting Lord Goff of Chieveley in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 476.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It was clear from the earlier discussions that Lebanon was the more appropriate forum for the Wrongful Arrest Claim. Before me, Best Soar also accepted that the Lebanon court was more appropriate if one just looked at the Wrongful Arrest Claim alone. However, Lebanon was not the more appropriate forum where the Contract Claim was concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Where then should the balance be struck in the present case? In my view, the connecting factors to Lebanon in respect of the Wrongful Arrest Claim, in particular the considerations of international comity, were more significant. Accordingly, I concluded that Praxis had succeeded in showing that Lebanon was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>a more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second stage of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Spiliada</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The legal burden was on Best Soar to show why the Singapore Proceedings should not be stayed even though Lebanon has been shown to be the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>more appropriate forum for the dispute. The main consideration at this stage is whether substantial justice can be obtained in the foreign court: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 75.096. The question is whether the foreign court would be able to try the dispute in a manner which is procedurally and substantively fair: <span class="font-italic">Tania </span><span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> at [110], citing Adrian Briggs, <span class="font-italic">Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments </span>(Informa Law, 6th Ed, 2015) at para 4.31.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Best Soar argued that it would suffer a serious disadvantage in the Lebanon courts because there was no express procedure for discovery or cross-examination of witnesses. I pause to note first that Best Soar did not adduce evidence from its expert on this. The burden being on Best Soar, it was incumbent on Best Soar to adduce evidence that Lebanese court procedure did not provide for discovery or cross-examination. Be that as it may, in my view, Best Soar’s argument merely pointed to differences between the common law system in Singapore and the civil law system in Lebanon. In my view, these differences did not amount to denial of substantial justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I therefore rejected Best Soar’s submission that it would be deprived of substantial justice if left to seek recourse in the Lebanon courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Best Soar further submitted that the Singapore Proceedings should not be stayed because it was also seeking an injunction to restrain Praxis from pursuing its claim under the Contract against Best Soar and/or the Vessel before <span class="font-italic">any </span>court or tribunal, or enforcing any judgment obtained from any such court or tribunal (see [11(c)] above). Best Soar argued that as Praxis is a Singapore company, this remedy could only be obtained in a Singapore court. I did not think that this was sufficient reason to not grant a stay in this case. This was an argument that applied to every defendant with a presence in Singapore. Besides, there was no evidence that Praxis was going to commence action elsewhere if it failed before the Lebanon courts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Partial stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Best Soar did not seek a partial stay. In fact, it argued against a partial stay. Best Soar referred to <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1322 in which the court observed (at [96]) that a partial stay “would be impermissible if there is a high degree of overlap in the claims leading to the possibility of inconsistent decisions by different courts”. I agreed that a partial stay would not have been appropriate in this case given that the Wrongful Arrest Claim and the Contract Claim were very closely connected. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limited stay on the ground of case management</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Praxis’ alternative submission was that the Singapore Proceedings should be stayed on the ground of case management pending the outcome of the Lebanon Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The court has the power to grant a limited stay under s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) read with para 9 of the First Schedule, alternatively under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The exercise of this discretion does not require the application of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> principles: <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung v Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Fatt Cheung and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 1192 at [47]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The grant of a limited stay of proceedings is a discretionary exercise of the court’s case management powers. This discretion is triggered when there is a multiplicity of proceedings. In considering all the circumstances of the case, the underlying concern is the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole. See <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob </span><span class="font-italic">Agam and another</span> [2017] 3 SLR 27 at [35].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Had I not decided that a stay should be granted on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>grounds, I would have granted a limited stay of the Singapore Proceedings pending the outcome of the Lebanon Proceedings. The Lebanon Proceedings were at a more advanced stage. The parties were waiting for the EBB to issue its decision and two rounds of written submissions had been made to the CCB. In my view, a limited stay would ensure an efficient and fair resolution of the dispute, avoid the possibility of conflicting decisions (especially on the Wrongful Arrest Claim) and promote international comity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For all of the reasons set out above, I affirmed the AR’s decision that the Singapore Proceedings should be stayed on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. In the result, Best Soar’s appeal was dismissed with costs fixed at $6,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by Best Soar to Praxis.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leong Kah Wah and Ko Weifen, Cindy (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Yap Ming Kwang Kelly and Jade Chia Kia Huang (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
