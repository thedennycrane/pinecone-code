<p align="justify" xmlns="">Legal Profession – solicitors cannot take a neutral

position where allegations made by other solicitor of conflict of interest <font size="4">–

</font>the court can only make a ruling of conflict of interest after a full inquiry and

not in proceedings for the discharge of a solicitor<b></b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Facts </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This was an application by Tan Kok Quan Partnership to be discharged

from acting as solicitors for the first defendant. The application followed a letter from

solicitor for the second defendant taking the view that Tan Kok Quan Partnership, having

acted as co-administrator for the first defendant’s late husband’s estate, may

be in breach of rule 29 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules. At the

resumed hearing, the applicant submitted that although he disputes the allegations of

conflict of interests, his firm could not, in the meantime, continue to act without a

resolution of the allegations.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">A solicitor is entitled to caution his counterpart when he believes

that a conflict of interest situation looms in the distance. Whether or not the solicitor

concerned agrees with that perception, he must decide whether he is comfortable in

continuing so to act. If he decides to continue acting for the client he must be prepared

to justify his conduct if necessary. The question as to whether he is right or not may

only be determined after a full inquiry; but this court, at this juncture, is not the

proper forum to conduct such an inquiry. Following the applicant firm’s statement

that the firm could not continue to act without a resolution of the allegations, the

application was allowed.</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#000080" size="4"><strong>Judgment<br/>

(Application for Discharge)</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This was an application by Tan Kok Quan Partnership as solicitors

for the first defendant (Lim Lie Hoa) for an order declaring that Tan Kok Quan Partnership

has ceased acting for the first defendant, and for the provision of costs although the

prayer ought more accurately be for leave to be discharged as solicitors for the first

defendant. The application was taken out on 8 April 2002. From the outset, it was a most

peculiar application, but I shall have to set out the background leading to the

application for a better understanding as to why that is so. The plaintiff is

unrepresented in these, as well as the previous proceedings. The second defendant is now

represented by Mr. Arul Chandran while the new parties, the third and fourth defendants

are represented by Mr. Devinder Rai.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. In 1991 the plaintiff (Jane Rebecca Ong) sued Lim Lie Hoa and the

second defendant (Ong Siauw Tjoan) in this action, that is, Originating Summons 939 of

1991. Ong Siau Tjoan was her estranged husband, and Lim Lie Hoa her mother-in-law (Ong

Siau Tjoan's mother). The assets (generally believed to be substantial - declared at one

point to be $5,117,269 - by the parties concerned) of Lim Lie Hoa's deceased husband (Ong

Seng King) lie at the heart of the dispute because Jane Rebecca Ong claimed that her

rights to matrimonial assets included her husband's share in his father's estate. At all

material times, Lim Lie Hoa and Ong Siauw Tjoan were the administrators of the said

estate. Matters proved far more complicated than it appeared. The first defendant was

clearly and, it seems, intractably antagonistic towards the plaintiff and all that she

proposed or said. Wavering between his wife and mother, the second defendant agreed to,

and did, execute a deed of assignment of half his share of his father's estate to the

plaintiff. However, he subsequently executed a deed of release in favour of the estate. In

the deed of release he accepted that he had already taken and enjoyed what was, as he

described in a letter he wrote, his "fair share" of the assets of the estate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. This Originating Summons was taken out by the plaintiff for a court

declaration that the deed of release was void and unenforceable, and for an order for an

inquiry into the estate of Ong Seng King so as to determine its true assets. At the end of

the trial in 1996, Justice Chao Hick Tin granted the plaintiffs the orders sought.

Consequently, the parties began to set in motion the steps necessary for the inquiry into

the assets of the estate and the plaintiff's share of it. The inquiry proper has not

commenced but the parties have been busy with various ancillary proceedings such as the

joinder of the third and fourth defendants as parties, naming the first defendant as a

third party, applications for interim payments, mareva injunctions, and now, this

application for an order that the solicitors for the first defendant to cease acting for

her.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The grounds of the application are set out in the affidavit of Choo

Chen Chen, a solicitor of Tan Kok Quan Partnership. The affidavit drew reference to a

letter of 4 April 2002 by C Arul &amp; Partners the current solicitors for the second

defendant addressed to the first defendant's solicitors. The letter reminded the firm that

Tan Kok Quan SC, who is the principal partner in Tan Kok Quan Partnership, was a partner

in the firm of Lee &amp; Lee which acted for the estate of Ong Seng King. Consequently,

the writer of this letter takes the view that Tan Kok Quan Partnership cannot now act for

the first defendant in the current proceedings against the second defendant because the

latter was a co-administrator of Ong Seng King's estate since that will require the firm

to act against one of its former clients, and be thus in breach of r 29 of the Legal

Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (the Rules). Secondly, as the assets of the estate

are being questioned, Tan Kok Quan SC may have to give evidence himself, and on that

account, he will be in breach of r 31 of the Rules. Tan Kok Quan Partnership then wrote to

the first defendant by telefax dated 5 April stating that in view of the second

defendant's objections it would be prudent for the firm to cease acting for her. The first

defendant sent a curt reply stating: "I do not wish to discharge M/s Tan Kok Quan

Partnership."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Mr. Ramesh, from Tan Kok Quan Partnership, making the application on

behalf of his firm expressed the opinion of his firm that they do not think that there is

any merit in Arul Chandran's assertions of conflict of interests. He initially took the

view that the firm was "neutral" on the question posed in this application as to

whether or not they should continue to act for the first defendant and decided to leave it

to the court to make whatever order it deems fit. He added that the first defendant does

not wish to discharge them. He then asked for the matter to be stood down so that the

first defendant could appear in person or engage an independent solicitor to advise her on

this matter of discharging her present solicitors. Before adjourning I indicated to

counsel that in such circumstances the applicant (the solicitors) cannot take a neutral

position. When the hearing resumed on 19 April Mr. Ramesh retracted from his neutral

position and submitted that although he disputes the allegations of conflict of interests,

his firm cannot, in the meantime, continue to act without a resolution of the allegations.

In the circumstances, I granted an order in terms of their application and the proceedings

were explained to the first defendant who asked for, and was given, one month to engage

another firm of solicitors to take over her case. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. I am mindful of the history of the personal relationship of the

parties in this action is steeped in acrimony and shall hope to be alert against any

creeping shadow of mischief from the parties. There are already several pending

applications that seems to me to be steps in the wrong direction. Some of them may be

necessary, but they must be dealt with swiftly by all concerned because everyone must

focus on proceeding as expeditiously as possible to get the inquiry underway. One of the

abovementioned applications is this application by Tan Kok Quan Partnership to be

discharged as solicitors for the first defendant. The application was precipitated by the

letter from Arul Chandran that I had referred to above. A solicitor is entitled to caution

his counterpart when he believes that a conflict of interest situation looms in the

distance, if it was not already upon the other. The solicitor concerned may or may not

agree with that perception. But he must decide whether he is comfortable in continuing so

to act. If he decides to continue acting for the client he must be prepared to justify his

conduct if necessary. The question as to whether he is right or not may only be determined

after a full inquiry; but this court, at this juncture, is not the proper forum to conduct

such an inquiry. The judge in any proceedings before him, sits as an adjudicator, not as

an advisor. That is why I indicated to Mr. Ramesh that he cannot take a neutral position

in the circumstances. He must decide whether he can continue to act for the first

defendant. If he believes so he ought to withdraw his firm's application. If he does not

feel that he or his firm can continue under the circumstances, it will only be fair to

allow the application, and not compel him or his firm to carry on under the threat of

disciplinary or other proceedings against them. But the court cannot make that election on

the firm's behalf. Neither can it declare the propriety or otherwise of the firm should

they decide to carry on because a declaration of this nature can only be made, as I have

said, after a full inquiry into a specific complaint. It is not the function of this court

to usurp the role an inquiry or disciplinary committee who would ordinarily be the

appropriate body to determine questions of the kind that have arisen here.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. In view of Mr. Ramesh’s statement that his firm cannot continue

to act in the face of the assertions being made against them, I granted Tan Kok Quan

Partnership the discharge prayed for.</p>
