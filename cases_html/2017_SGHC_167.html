However, the fact that the Parties are divorced has no bearing on my decision in the present suit, which relates to a determination of the pre-divorce positions of the Parties as beneficial owners of the four properties concerned. I will elaborate further on this distinction below (see [12]–[22]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Parties were solemnised under Syariah law on 28 December 1995.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Not an exercise of matrimonial jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Before I deal with the substance of the dispute, I shall first address the arguments made by the Defendant in relation to the overlap between civil jurisdiction and Syariah matrimonial law. It is clear to me that these arguments stem from a misunderstanding by the Defendant of the nature of the Plaintiff’s claim in the present dispute. As I have alluded to above at [2], the suit brought by the Plaintiff concerns only the respective beneficial ownership of the Plaintiff and the Defendant in the disputed properties. This suit does not relate to the court’s exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction to divide the Parties’ matrimonial assets. All that is being asked in the present suit is for the court to determine the respective shares of the Parties’ beneficial interest. I am thus not exercising any form of matrimonial jurisdiction. In other words, the fact that the Parties are married (or divorced) has no relevance to the question of ownership in the present case, which falls to be decided exclusively on an application of the common law principles of property ownership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In a related vein, in connection with the operation of the presumption of advancement, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span><span class="font-italic">v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) made the following observations: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">80  Sections 51 and 52 of the [Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)], taken with s 112 of the same legislation, have resulted in a “deferred community of property” approach in the determination of the property rights of spouses. The former two sections have <span class="font-italic">the effect of rendering the fact, that a woman is married, irrelevant to her proprietary interests; her entitlement to proprietary interests depends on the same rules as the entitlement of an unmarried woman or man</span>. The latter section, on the other hand, has empowered the courts with a broad discretion to divide “matrimonial assets” between spouses during or after matrimonial proceedings to terminate their marriage; it is based on the principle of “community of property”, under which both spouses have a joint interest in certain property, regardless of which spouse purchased or otherwise acquired it: see Leong Wai Kum, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Family Law in Singapore</span> (Butterworths Asia, 1997) at pp 799–800.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">81  Therefore, the “community of property” approach to the property rights of spouses only operates where there are matrimonial proceedings terminating a marriage. When the marriage subsists, property law, including the law of resulting trusts, applies, without modification, to determine the respective proprietary rights of spouses. The application of the ordinary rules of law and equity relating to real and personal property are discussed by Anthony Dickey QC in <span class="font-italic">Family Law </span>(LBC Information Services, 3rd Ed, 1997). He noted at p 587 that “<span class="font-italic">there are no special rules concerning the normal interests of spouses in property</span>”…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added; original emphasis omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Having set out this background, I turn now to address the Defendant’s arguments in sequence. The Defendant submits that it is unmeritorious and/or duplicitous and/or not within the proper administration of justice for a civil court to determine property interests in matrimonial proceedings when the Parties are both Muslims and the marriage is itself governed by Syariah law. In fact, this was the subject matter of an application (Summons No 1909 of 2016) taken out by the Defendant seeking a stay of the present suit (“the Stay Application”) pursuant to s 17A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”). The material part of s 17A of the SCJA reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Civil jurisdiction — concurrent jurisdiction with Syariah Court in certain matters</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">17A.</span>—(1) Notwithstanding sections 16 and 17 [which deal with the High Court’s general and specific civil jurisdiction], the High Court shall have no jurisdiction to hear and try any civil proceedings involving matters which come within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court under section 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 3) in which all the parties are Muslims or where the parties were married under the provisions of the Muslim law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Notwithstanding that such matters come within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court under section 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">e</span>), 51 or 52(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act, <span class="font-italic">the High Court shall have jurisdiction as is vested in it by any written law to hear and try any civil proceedings involving matters relating to</span> —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) maintenance for any wife or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) custody of any child; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) <span class="font-italic">disposition or division of property on divorce</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where civil proceedings involving any matter referred to in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and involving parties who are Muslims or were married under the provisions of the Muslim law are commenced in the High Court, <span class="font-italic">the High Court shall stay the civil proceedings</span> —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) involving any matter referred to in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>), <span class="font-italic">if the civil proceedings are commenced on or after the commencement of proceedings for divorce in the Syariah Court </span>or after the making of a decree or order for divorce by the Syariah Court or on or after the registration of any divorce under section 102 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 3) <span class="font-italic">between the same parties</span>, unless a Syariah Court commencement certificate in respect of the civil proceedings has been filed with the High Court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the time of the hearing for the Stay Application, there was a pending Originating Summons No 49735 taken out by the Defendant in the Syariah Court on 29 March 2016, seeking an order for divorce <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Plaintiff. The Assistant Registrar (“AR”) hearing the Stay Application dismissed the application for two reasons. First, since the present suit (commenced on 6 November 2015) was not “commenced on or after the commencement of proceedings for divorce in the Syariah Court” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 29 March 2016), there was no basis to order a mandatory stay under s 17A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SCJA. Second, there was no other basis for the court to exercise its discretion to order a stay of the present suit.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Presumably, the Defendant is relying on the argument that there has been a material change in circumstance since the Stay Application was decided: the Parties were declared to have been divorced on 5 October 2015, which is before the civil proceedings commenced on 6 November 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In my judgment, the Defendant’s argument is misguided. As evident from the language of s 17A(2) read with s 17A(3) of the SCJA (see above at [14]), what matters is whether the civil proceeding was “commenced on or after the <span class="font-italic">commencement of proceedings for divorce </span>in the Syariah Court” [emphasis added]. The key date is thus the date of <span class="font-italic">commencement</span> of the divorce proceedings and not the actual date of divorce as declared by the Syariah Court. To this extent, the issue is clearly <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and need no further consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Even if I am wrong on this point, I take the view that the present suit does not relate to “disposition or division of property on divorce”, as stated in s 17A(2) of the SCJA. Instead, as emphasised above, it relates to a determination of the beneficial ownership of the disputed properties <span class="font-italic">irrespective</span> of the marital status of the Parties. This means that the question of whether the High Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Syariah Court under s 17A(2) of the SCJA to try this dispute does not arise in the first place. The High Court has not eclipsed or replaced the matrimonial jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In fact, following the present suit, the Parties are free to seek a ruling from the Syariah Court on the division of their matrimonial assets, in connection with their divorce. In exercising its matrimonial jurisdiction, the Syariah Court will divide and apportion <span class="font-italic">post-divorce</span> all the matrimonial assets as it thinks “just and equitable”: see s 52(7) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3, 2009 Rev Ed) (“AMLA”). Here, not only a <span class="font-italic">wider</span> pool of assets than the disputed properties will be considered, all the facts and considerations stated in s 57(8) of the AMLA will also be taken into account. This would be akin to the “community of property” approach as it was referred to by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> (see above at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 From the foregoing analysis, it is clear that neither matrimonial principles nor Syariah law is relevant to the present dispute, although they may arise at the stage where the Syariah Court is asked to divide the matrimonial assets between the Parties. This point is also echoed by a local commentator (see Ahmad Nizam bin Abbas, “The Islamic Legal System in Singapore” [2012] 21(1) Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Journal 163 at p 175):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Furthermore, sometimes cases that begin in the civil courts evolve into cases that fall within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. For example, prior to the commencement of a divorce case[,] Muslim spouses may <span class="font-italic">litigate</span><span class="font-italic"> issues of property ownership. These issues are governed not by Muslim law but by the common law of property</span>, <span class="font-italic">subject to the equitable doctrines of</span><span class="font-italic"> trusts </span>[citing <span class="font-italic">Madiah Bte Atan v Samsudin Bin Budin</span> [1998] 2 SLR 679]. However, when a divorce case is commenced, the Syariah Court acquires not only the power to issue a divorce decree, but also to make ancillary orders regarding that divorce, including orders about matrimonial assets. In such cases, the courts must work out some method of <span class="font-italic">avoiding</span><span class="font-italic"> conflicting rulings.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As cautioned by Mr Nizam, the courts must seek to avoid inconsistent rulings. Thus, if, hypothetically, I declare that the Changi Court property belongs solely to the Plaintiff and the Aston Residence belongs solely to the Defendant, the Syariah Court should, in the division of the matrimonial assets, avoid making or relying on a different finding of fact that the Changi Court belongs solely to the Defendant and the Aston Residence belongs solely to the Plaintiff. Similarly, if I find that the Plaintiff made all the financial payments in the acquisition of the Changi Court property, the Syariah Court should avoid finding that the Defendant had paid for the same property in whole or in part for the purpose of ascertaining the respective financial contributions of the parties towards the acquisition of the property. The same would apply if the Syariah Court had first made certain findings of fact; the civil courts, including the High Court, should similarly avoid making any inconsistent findings. Conflicting decisions on factual findings should thus be avoided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Otherwise, the Syariah Court’s jurisdiction to divide matrimonial assets is fully protected. For instance, if the Syariah Court takes the view, as a matter of what is “just and equitable” in dividing the matrimonial assets and in taking into account other factors such as the significant non-financial contributions made by the Defendant as the primary caregiver of the daughter, that the Changi Court property held in the joint names of the Parties should be allocated wholly to the Defendant instead of the Plaintiff as part of the Defendant’s share of all the matrimonial assets, the Syariah Court is fully entitled to order the Plaintiff to transfer his interest in the Changi Court property to the Defendant. Such a possible determination does not contradict my decision in the present suit nor does it necessarily make my decision duplicitous because what I am deciding in this case is completely non-matrimonial in nature. To that extent, given the additional factors and considerations operative in the division of matrimonial assets (apart from purely financial contributions of the respective parties in the acquisition of various matrimonial assets), there is no overlap between the decision in the present suit concerning the Parties’ respective beneficial interest in the disputed properties and the possible subsequent division of all matrimonial assets owned by the Parties in the Syariah Court. Further, following the present suit, it might well be that neither of the Parties would apply for a division of matrimonial assets by the Syariah Court under s 52(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AMLA or by the civil courts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Having explained that the present suit solely concerns the determination of the Parties’ beneficial interest in the disputed properties, I am guided by the following structured approach laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span><span class="font-italic"> v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“C<span class="font-italic">han Yuen Lan</span>”) at [160]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     Is there sufficient evidence<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property?

If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)     If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e)     If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)?

If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in one of the modes set out at (b)–(e) above, depending on which is applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In summary, I find that under step (a), whilst there is sufficient evidence of the Plaintiff’s contribution in respect of all of the disputed properties, there is, at best, evidence of the Defendant’s contribution only in respect of the Changi Court property. Under steps (b) and (f), there is no sufficient evidence of any common intention between the Parties during any point in time, at and after the acquisition. Under steps (d) and (e), the evidence reveals that the Plaintiff did not intend his contributions to the property as a gift to the Defendant and the presumption of advancement applied to rebut the presumed resulting trust arising under step (a) in respect of the Changi Court and the Toh Crescent properties. My detailed reasons are as follows. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step (a) – Resulting trust analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on resulting trusts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The starting point is that legal joint tenants who have contributed unequally to the purchase price of the property will be presumed to beneficially own a share of the property proportionate to their respective contributions to its purchase price (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [83]; <span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew</span> [2012] 2 SLR 831 at [14]–[15]). However, as the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, it is generally right to apply the presumption of resulting trust <span class="font-italic">only</span> where there is no or insufficient evidence from which to prove or infer the intention of the transferor or contributor, at least on a balance of probability (at [51]–[52]; see also <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [36]). Thus, the main question is whether there is sufficient evidence which adequately reveals the intention of the transferor or contributor. If not, (or for that matter, if the evidence is so finely balanced as to be equivocal), the presumption of resulting trust will be relied upon. This is in line with the lack-of-intention analysis being the doctrinal basis for resulting trusts (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the resulting trust is a response to a lack of intention on the part of the person providing the purchase price to benefit the recipient), as alluded to by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It is also trite that resulting trusts crystallise at the time of acquisition and direct financial contributions are contributions to the purchase price of the property at the time of its acquisition (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [112]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The more vexed question is the relevance of subsequent mortgage payments and this has invited much exposition by the apex court in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the Court of Appeal expressly limited direct contributions to mortgage repayments made on the basis of an agreement when the loan was taken out for the purpose of acquisition of the property at that time. Mortgage repayments without a prior agreement are thus not direct contributions to the purchase price in the context of resulting trusts (at [116]). In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, there was a slight step back from this, as the Court of Appeal stated that it was minded to consider whether this rule ought to be relaxed such that subsequent mortgage payments, even where there was no prior agreement, can be considered direct contributions (at [55]–[57]). Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>”), the Court of Appeal conclusively determined that subsequent mortgage payments cannot be taken into account, unless they are referable to a prior agreement between the parties at the time the loan for the purchase of the property is taken out on how they are to service the loan repayments, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, reverting back to the position in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89  In our judgment, it is correct to analyse the position by reference to the responsibility that is undertaken by each party for loan repayments at the time the property is acquired. When a mortgage is taken out, the crucial consideration is the parties’ intentions, at the time the property is acquired, as to the ultimate source of the funds for purchase of that property (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [116] and <span class="font-italic">Bertei v Feher </span>[2000] WASCA 165 at [44]). <span class="font-italic">Actual mortgage payments made at a later time would therefore only count as direct contributions to the purchase price where these are referable to, and in keeping with, a prior agreement between the parties as to who would be liable to repay the loan.</span> It is, as we have said earlier, the parties’ agreement at the time of acquisition that is critical.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">92 In contrast, <span class="font-italic">actual</span> <span class="font-italic">repayments that are not referable to the parties’ agreement as to how they intend to service the mortgage should not be taken into account for determining the ownership interest on a resulting trust analysis</span> because, as we have said, the interest under a resulting trust crystallises at the time of purchase. If such subsequent payments were computed as part of the parties’ contributions to the purchase price, it would mean that the parties’ interests under the resulting trust are in a state of flux, increasing or decreasing as the case may be when one party makes repayment of the mortgage. In our judgment, this would be wrong in principle.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 This was reiterated in the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and other appeals</span> [2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”), which affirmed the view in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> and <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> as follows (at [142]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">142 In a resulting trust analysis, the loan repayments are relevant only in so far as there is an agreement on how the loan is to be repaid at the time the asset is acquired: see the decision of this court in [<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [116]–[117]. We agree with the Judge that the focus should therefore generally be on who took on liability for the [loan]. What this refers to is whether there was any agreement, at the time the loan was taken, as to the <span class="font-italic">ultimate source</span> of the funds that would be used to repay the loan. As this court recently cautioned in [<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [90], the persons who took on the liability is only one piece of evidence in the puzzle, and subsequent conduct may also be relevant insofar as it is proof of the agreement made at the date of the loan:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Many factors are engaged in the determination of the precise agreement or understanding between the parties as to who would repay the mortgage. <span class="font-weight-bold">The focus should not lie exclusively on who took on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">liability</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> for the mortgage as against the bank.</span> Often such liability will be joint because the bank would like to have the widest choice of the parties against whom it can enforce the liability under the mortgage. Rather, the question will turn on what the operating agreement was between the co-owning parties at the time the loan was taken out.

</div>
</div> With respect to the mortgages taken out to pay for the balance of the purchase prices, I note that all the mortgages were taken out in the joint names of the Parties such that the default position in the absence of evidence of any operating agreement as to who would be repaying the mortgage would be that both of them are assumed to have contributed equally to a part of the total purchase price through the taking up of the various mortgages for which both are jointly liable to the mortgagee bank (see <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [91]; <span class="font-italic">Curley v Parkes</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1515 at [14], cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan</span> <span class="font-italic">Yuen</span> <span class="font-italic">Lan</span> at [53]). As I explained earlier (see above at [27]–[28]), this default position can be altered if there is evidence of any prior agreement between the Parties at the time the various mortgages were taken as to who was ultimately to bear responsibility for the mortgage payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the present case, although there was no express agreement between the Parties at the time the mortgages were taken out for acquiring the various disputed properties as to who should pay for the mortgage instalments, it is clear to me that there was an implied agreement between them that the Plaintiff was to pay for all the instalments. This only made sense as the Defendant was a homemaker and had no sources of income of her own. Consistent with this agreement, the available bank statements show that the Plaintiff paid for most of the mortgage instalments.

These examples are merely illustrative of the importance of context in discerning the understanding and agreement between the parties at the time the loan is obtained….</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, even though the mortgages were taken out in the joint names of the Parties, I find that there was an agreement between the Parties, in respect of each of these mortgages, at the time the loans were taken, that the Plaintiff would service all the mortgage instalments. This means that the Plaintiff should be taken to have contributed <span class="font-italic">entirely</span> to the acquisition of these four disputed properties, by paying not only for the upfront purchase price but also the balance, through an agreement with the Defendant that he would be responsible to service all the mortgage instalments. The only exception is the Changi Court property, to which the Defendant contributed (at best) 19.7% of the total purchase price (as will be explained later). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Defendant’s financial contributions or lack thereof </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The way in which the Defendant seeks a share in the disputed properties is through her contribution of $123,447.84 to the Plaintiff. This amount is derived from the sale proceeds of the 3-room ($72,894.51) and 3½-room flats ($83,447.84), which were previously owned by the Defendant. The Defendant admitted to using part of the $72,894.51 to pay for the purchase price and renovation works of the 3 ½-room flat and for the deposit of a Proton Saga motor vehicle such that she was only left with about $40,000.

In fact, the Defendant herself could not positively confirm that the monies had been so used. To the contrary, the Defendant’s evidence in her affidavit (see above at [35]) suggests that the sale proceeds of her two HDB flats was not used to purchase any of the disputed properties: she only stated that it was used to fund his business capital, a car, and to buy a condominium in Johor Bahru. No reference was made to the purchase of any of the disputed properties in her affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the circumstances, all I can decipher is that the Defendant had $123,447.84, which was used by the Plaintiff to do whatever he wanted to do. She could not be sure whether it was used for the Plaintiff’s business, to buy properties, or to do something else because she did not control or monitor his usage of her funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I will make some key observations in relation to the evidence. First, the Defendant claims to have a property interest in the disputed properties by virtue of the fact that the properties were bought from the income generated through the Plaintiff’s business, for which she had provided initial capital. However, the Defendant is unable to prove exactly how much she had contributed to the Plaintiff’s business. Leaving aside the evidential point, even if it could be proved that she had contributed a quantifiable sum of money to the Plaintiff’s business capital, I find it difficult to conclude that this would, without more, constitute a <span class="font-italic">direct</span> financial contribution to the <span class="font-italic">purchase pri</span><span class="font-italic">ce </span>of the disputed properties: see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [114]. If indirect contributions in relation to the property (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in the form of repairs, insurance or taxes) are not in themselves generally sufficient to constitute a “direct” contribution capable of constituting a presumed resulting trust, it will be anomalous for the contribution claimed by the Defendant here to be considered “direct” when it has passed through the vehicle of the Plaintiff’s business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Second, during the examination-in-chief of the Defendant by her counsel, Mr Mohammed Shakirin (“MS”), the Defendant alluded to the fact that she had also taken care of the household and their daughter, and indirectly supported the Plaintiff’s business, such that she should be given an interest in the disputed properties:

Whilst these contributions by the Defendant may be taken into consideration in matrimonial proceedings for the purpose of division of matrimonial assets, it is not appropriate for the court to take cognisance of these contributions in the context of a resulting trust analysis to determine the Parties’ respective beneficial interest in the disputed properties.

</div>
</div> This is because if the Defendant had no remaining monies of her own after 1999, she could not logically have contributed any funds to the acquisition of the Toh Crescent property, the Aston Residence, as well as the Queen’s Road HDB, because all of these properties were acquired after 1999. The only properties acquired during or before 1999 are the Riverria condominium, Petrie condominium, and the Changi Court property. If it is true that the Defendant had directly paid for the acquisition of any of the properties jointly owned by the Parties using her sum of $123,447.84, it could only have been for these three properties, of which only the Changi Court property forms part of the disputed properties in the present proceedings. There is also no possibility of these monies being ploughed back into other disputed properties, as the Malaysian properties and the Changi Court property were not sold until 2015 (for the Riverria and Petrie condominiums) and 2016 (for the Changi Court property). The Defendant not having demonstrated any other source of funds from her, this foregoing analysis strongly suggests that only the Plaintiff’s monies could have been used to purchase the other disputed properties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Toh Crescent property, the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB). This would buttress the finding that a presumed resulting trust over 100% of the beneficial interest in each of these three properties arises in favour of the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In relation to the Changi Court property, it is undisputed that the Defendant had used $7,700 of her CPF to pay for the upfront cost of the property (amounting to 1.16% of the total purchase price of $665,000). Other than that, there is no clear evidence of how much the Defendant had paid (out of the $123,447.84 cash that she had) for the acquisition of the Changi Court property. The Defendant herself was not able to point to a figure as her evidence was simply that the Plaintiff could do whatever he wanted with that sum of money. Thus, it might well be possible that the entire sum of $123,447.84 was used to purchase the earlier properties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Riverria and Petrie condominiums (or either one of them) in Johor Bahru, before the Changi Court property was purchased in 1999. If so, this would mean that no part of the $123,447.84 was used to purchase the Changi Court property, such that the Defendant should similarly hold the Changi Court property on a presumed resulting trust for the Plaintiff except for her share of 1.16%. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 However, even though the Defendant cannot prove exactly how much she paid for the acquisition of the Changi Court property, I find that the Defendant has, on her best case, paid $131,147.84 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sum of $123,447.84 and $7,700) towards the purchase price of the Changi Court property.

</div>
</div>
</div> Given this situation of having to weigh one person’s word against another’s, it is important for me to consider the requirements to be satisfied in order to prove a CICT. According to the test in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, which was restated in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">83 … In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, we surveyed the law on the common intention constructive trust in the UK, Australia and Canada. It is not necessary to retrace the comprehensive discussion in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>(at [95]–[161]), save to restate a few principles. First, in the absence of any evidence of a common intention between the parties as to how the beneficial interest in the property concerned is to be held, the resulting trust remains the default analysis (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [158]). Second, to successfully invoke the common intention constructive trust, the common intention (which may subsist either at, or subsequent to, the time the property was acquired) between the parties may either be express or inferred. Third, <span class="font-italic">there must be </span><span class="font-italic">sufficient and compelling evidence of the express or inferred common intention</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(b)] and [160(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added; original emphasis omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the evidence, I find that there is no sufficient and compelling evidence of a CICT in respect of each of the four disputed properties. Even if it is to be accepted that the Defendant had believed all along that she held an equal share in the properties, for a CICT to be found the intention “must in fact be <span class="font-italic">common </span>to all the parties involved” (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [84]) [emphasis in original]. There is no evidence in the present case from which it may be inferred such a <span class="font-italic">common</span> intention in respect of the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB, which were purchased primarily as part of the Plaintiff’s personal investments in properties. For the other two disputed properties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Changi Court and Toh Crescent properties), which I accept to be intended for the Parties’ familial use, I also find that there is insufficient evidence of a common intention between the Parties in order to justify a CICT. Instead, I find that the presumption of advancement is applicable and unrebutted (see below at [56]–[63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to the point on CICT with respect to the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB, contrary to the Defendant’s submissions, any common intention to jointly own the property in equity is inconsistent with the objective evidence. First, the rental proceeds in respect of these two properties were exclusively collected by the Plaintiff, and the Defendant admitted that she had never asked the Plaintiff for a share of these proceeds.

</div> This allegation of a promise was similarly unsubstantiated. Third, I find incredible the Defendant’s evidence that she was told by the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff’s business was “supposed to be also [her] business” and that she had an equal share in all the properties acquired from the business profits (see above at [48]). If she truly believed that she owned a share of the business, it is inconceivable for her not to have requested any kind of shares or dividends in the past 20 odd years of their marriage. In any event, this intention or belief is unlikely to have been shared by the Plaintiff, who would naturally credit all income earned from the business to his personal “efforts and hard work”.

The key inquiry here is whether the Plaintiff, who made the sole or larger financial contribution to the acquisition of the disputed properties, intended a gift of his contribution to the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 There is insufficient evidence of a gift and thus the answer to step (d) is unequivocally in the negative.

As cautioned by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [59], just like the presumption of resulting trust, the presumption of advancement is only an evidential tool relied upon as a matter of last resort where there is a paucity of evidence that reveals the intention of the transferor or contributor, or where such evidence is inconclusive or equivocal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the present case, the presumption of advancement clearly arises as it concerns a spousal relationship: see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [70]. The only contentious questions are the strength of the presumption and whether the presumption is rebutted. First, in assessing the strength of the presumption of advancement, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> noted the following: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">78 The overall aim of the presumption of advancement is to discern the intention of the transferor… [<span class="font-italic">A</span>]<span class="font-italic">ll </span>the circumstances of the case should be taken into account by the court when assessing how strongly the presumption of advancement should be applied in the particular case. The financial dependence of the recipient on the transferor or contributor… is but one factor which may affect the strength of the presumption of advancement. In our judgment, two key elements are crucial in determining the strength of the presumption of advancement in any given case: <span class="font-italic">first</span>, the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>of the relationship between the parties (for example, the obligation (legal, moral or otherwise) that one party has towards another or the dependency between the parties); and <span class="font-italic">second</span>, the <span class="font-italic">state </span>of the relationship (for example, whether the relationship is a close and caring one or one of formal convenience). The court should consider whether, in the entirety of the circumstances, it is readily presumed that the transferor or contributor intended to make a gift to the recipient and, if so, whether the evidence is sufficient to rebut the presumption, given the appropriate strength of the presumption in that case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In my view, the nature of the relationship is sufficient in this case to trigger the operation of a relatively strong presumption of advancement. The Defendant was financially dependent on the Plaintiff to an appreciable extent. She was a homemaker since November 1998 and had a barren income stream from 1998 to the present. Even though she operated a spa and fitness centre from 2004 to 2007, this business did not earn any profits.

This interpretation is supported by the fact that a resulting trust need not necessarily relate to the entire interest in the property. The presumption of <span class="font-italic">resulting trust </span>may be rebutted as to a life interest, but may still operate in respect of the interest in remainder: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Napier v Public Trustee </span>(1980) 32 ALR 153.

We are of the view that the presumption of advancement could similarly operate with respect to only <span class="font-italic">part </span>of the interest in the property in question; it may be rebutted as to the life interest of a property but prevail as to the remainder – one such case would be where a property is held on joint tenancy and it is inferred that there is an intention for the rule of survivorship to operate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">107  To summarise, both the presumption of resulting trust and the presumption of advancement may feature whenever there is a legal joint tenancy in place and there are unequal contributions to the purchase price of the jointly-owned property. The presumption of resulting trust will operate in such a situation since equity abhors joint tenancy as a form of common ownership. The presumption of advancement, on the other hand, comes into play to displace the presumption of resulting trust where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties which falls into one of the established categories of relationships. In particular, where the joint tenants are spouses, the presumption of advancement applies to presume an intention on the part of the parties for the rule of survivorship to operate; the scope of the presumption should be expanded to include (if it does not already so include) the inference of an intention for the absolute beneficial ownership of the property to be conferred on the surviving joint tenant…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my judgment, the Plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> is misplaced. The Court of Appeal was simply alluding to the fact that the presumption of advancement should be <span class="font-italic">broadened</span> to encompass the operation of the rule of survivorship. What this means is that in every case of joint tenancy, where the presumption of advancement applies, two different intentions will be presumed: (1) the intention of the primary or sole contributor to share jointly in equity with the co-owner while both spouses are alive and (2) the intention of the contributor for the rule of survivorship to operate upon his passing. In this connection, the latter intention is irrelevant at present as both spouses are alive. The key dispute is whether the former intention to share jointly in equity is rebutted. In rebutting this intention, especially given the considerable strength of the presumption of advancement that arises in the present case, it is not enough for the Plaintiff to merely assert that his intention was exclusively for the rule of survivorship to operate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the evidence, I find that the presumption of advancement to share jointly in equity is rebutted in respect of the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB, but not in respect of the Changi Court and Toh Crescent properties. The key distinguishing fact between these two groups of properties is that the former two were acquired with the intention of them being investments of the Plaintiff for his <span class="font-italic">own benefit</span> whereas the latter two were intended to be used as the Parties’ places of familial residence for their <span class="font-italic">joint benefit</span>.

</div> These two properties thus belong in the same class as the other personal investments in properties made by the Plaintiff, such as the Changi Rise condominium, the Kovan condominium and the several other Malaysian properties. The intention of the Plaintiff with respect to these personal investments is clear from the way he treated them: he primarily rented them out, and sold them where a profit could be made. He, and not the Defendant, collected all the rental proceeds and also the sale proceeds where applicable. None of these were shared with the Defendant and there was no evidence before me that the Plaintiff had committed any of these investment returns or proceeds to the Defendant’s benefit. Rather, the evidence shows that the Plaintiff had kept to himself all the rental proceeds for his own benefit and use.

</div> Accordingly, I find that the presumption of advancement has been rebutted with respect to the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB because the intention of the Plaintiff, at the time these two properties were acquired, was not to share jointly in equity with the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In contrast, the intention of the Plaintiff in acquiring the Changi Court and Toh Crescent properties is different.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Given the finding above that the Defendant is a resulting trustee only in respect of the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB, I will only have to consider whether the Plaintiff’s claim can be made out in respect of these two properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65  In order for the Plaintiff’s claim to succeed, he has to show that if the Defendant had agreed to refinancing, these two properties (one of which is a HDB flat) could have been refinanced. He also has to prove the quantum of funds that could have been obtained, and that as a result of the failure to obtain that specific amount of funds from refinancing these two properties, the Plaintiff had suffered consequential losses that are causally connected to the Defendant’s failure to secure such refinancing. However, the Plaintiff did not adduce any such evidence to establish in principle that his losses have a causal link with the Defendant’s alleged breach that is not too remote. The Plaintiff’s bald assertion that his business suffered as a result of the Defendant’s breach in failing to assist in securing extra funding (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to the extent that those funds would be available from the refinancing of these two properties), is too vague and not sufficiently probative to show a causal link between the purported breach and his alleged losses. Thus, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, even if the Plaintiff can subsequently prove causal loss, I am hesitant to find, in the present case, that the Defendant (as a resulting trustee) owed a duty to the Plaintiff (as the beneficiary of the resulting trust) to agree to the Plaintiff’s request to refinance the two properties. Here, I understand the Plaintiff’s expression of the duty owed by the Defendant to be an instantiation of the general principle that trustees ought to act in the best interests of the beneficiary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The duties owed by a resulting trustee (albeit in a general context) was recently considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>where it was opined at [190] that a resulting trust is “very often a bare trust and, as such, <span class="font-italic">only</span> requires the trustee to convey the trust property when called upon to do so” [emphasis added]. The Court of Appeal then went on to make the following observations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">194 … <span class="font-italic">[F]</span><span class="font-italic">iduciary obligations are voluntarily undertaken</span>… [T]he fiduciary undertaking is voluntary in the sense that it arises as a consequence of the fiduciary’s conduct, and is not imposed by law independently of the fiduciary’s intentions. This is not to state that the fiduciary must be subjectively willing to undertake those obligations; the undertaking arises where the fiduciary voluntarily places himself in a position where the law can objectively impute an intention on his or her part to undertake those obligations. The corollary of this principle is that not every duty owed by a fiduciary is necessarily a fiduciary duty. However … the duty to perform a trust honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiaries is fiduciary in nature.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">196 When the attributes of a resulting trustee and a fiduciary are juxtaposed, one can very justifiably ask the question whether a resulting trustee is or can be a fiduciary. As a matter of principle, <span class="font-italic">the idea that a fiduciary relationship is possible sits uncomfortably with the fact of a resulting trust</span>. The latter is imposed by law whereas the former is voluntarily undertaken. It is certainly not the case that every resulting trustee is subject to a fiduciary relationship. However, in the rare case, it may well be that the facts and circumstances leading to the imposition of a resulting trust may also disclose an undertaking by the trustee – whether express or implied – to act in a certain way. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">205  … [R]esulting trustees can be located on a continuum. At one end are the innocent recipients of property, and at the other end are recipients of property which forms the subject of a failed express trust. It is therefore conceivable that a person who becomes a resulting trustee on the basis of a failed express trust may still owe fiduciary duties; we agree with Prof Chambers and Prof Virgo that it is generally difficult to say that that undertaking to act in another’s benefit – or in more abstract terms the undertaking to act in self-denial – should cease when that express trust fails. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">206 The real question, in our view, is whether, <span class="font-italic">objectively speaking</span>, <span class="font-italic">the resulting trustee can be said to have undertaken (whether expressly or impliedly) to act in a particular way which is fiduciary in nature</span>. In this regard, <span class="font-italic">the knowledge that one does not hold the beneficial interest in the property is, while not a sufficient condition by itself, strictly necessary because the conscience cannot otherwise be affected in a way that equity can take cognisance of</span>. The duties that are applicable to each resulting trustee will vary significantly, and are <span class="font-italic">very fact-</span><span class="font-italic">specific</span>. The duties owed by a resulting trustee to the settlor-beneficiary will, however, almost invariably be narrower than the duties owed by an express trustee in relation to the beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added; original emphasis omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As evident from the above, although the Court of Appeal opined that resulting trustees do not generally owe any fiduciary duties, it was prepared to accept that a resulting trustee of a <span class="font-italic">failed express trust</span> may owe such duties of a fiduciary nature. Although the above observations were made in the context of a failed express trust, I see no reason why it does not equally apply in the context of a purchase money resulting trust. The crux of the inquiry is the same regardless of the context: whether the resulting trustee had voluntarily placed himself in a position where the law can objectively impute an intention on his or her part to undertake the fiduciary obligations. On an objective test, where the resulting trustee can be said to have undertaken to act in this manner, it is only fair and equitable for fiduciary obligations to be owed by the resulting trustee. If it were otherwise, then resulting trustees can escape from the duties that they have undertaken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Although the test is the same, the situations in which a purchase money resulting trustee can be said to have voluntarily undertaken to act in a way that is fiduciary in nature will likely be less commonplace than in the case of a failed express trust. In the context of a failed express trust, even though the conditions for creating an express trust are not met, the resulting trustee may conceivably be aware and cognisant of the fact that he does not own the property beneficially (when transferred from the settlor) and that he only holds the property on trust for the beneficiary. In contrast, such knowledge is unlikely to be present where it concerns a purchase money resulting trustee, especially in a domestic and informal spousal context. However, in the rare case where the resulting trustee had the requisite knowledge, and can be said to have voluntarily undertaken fiduciary obligations, then the resulting trustee ought to owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Applying the test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [206] as to whether the Defendant had undertaken to act in a way that is fiduciary in nature, the Defendant’s knowledge that she does not hold beneficial interest in the property is “strictly necessary”: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [206]. Such knowledge is absent in the present case – the Defendant believed all along that she had a beneficial interest in the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB. In fact, she had no knowledge that she did not hold the beneficial interest in any of the properties that the Parties had purchased in joint names. This is evident in the following testimony of the Defendant during cross-examination:

She had all along believed that she beneficially owned these disputed properties jointly with the Plaintiff. In the circumstances, there is no indication that the Defendant voluntarily placed herself in a position where the law can objectively impute an intention onto her to undertake fiduciary obligations in respect of the Aston Residence and the Queen’s Road HDB. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Since I have found that the Defendant did not undertake to act in a manner that is fiduciary in nature, she does not owe the Plaintiff a duty to re-finance the property in the best interests of the beneficiary.

Since this question does not arise on the facts (because I find that the Defendant did not know of the existence of the resulting trust) and no arguments have been made on this point by the Parties, I need not say further other than to repeat the Court of Appeal’s point in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [206] that the duties that are owed by a resulting trustee is “very fact-specific”. It is preferable to leave this question open for future consideration when the specific need arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I accordingly decline to allow the Plaintiff’s claim for losses allegedly suffered in connection with the Defendant’s refusal to sign the re-financing documents.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For the reasons stated above, I make the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Parties are joint tenants in equity in respect of the Changi Court property and the Plaintiff and the Defendant are each entitled to 50% of the net sale proceeds (if any) after deduction of the mortgage loan, outstanding interest and sale expenses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Parties are joint tenants in equity in respect of the Toh Crescent property and the Plaintiff and the Defendant are each entitled to 50% of the net sale proceeds (if any) after deduction of the mortgage loan, outstanding interest and sale expenses in the event the repossessed property is sold;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Plaintiff is the sole beneficial owner of the Aston Residence and he is entitled to the net sale proceeds of the Aston Residence held presently by the stakeholders; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Plaintiff is the sole beneficial owner of the Queen’s Road HDB; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) for the avoidance of doubt, the above orders are without prejudice to any applicable orders of the Syariah Court concerning division and transfer of matrimonial assets pursuant to the ongoing divorce proceedings of the Parties before the Syariah Court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I decline to find in favour of the Plaintiff’s claim for losses or damages allegedly caused on occasion of the Defendant’s refusal to sign the re-financing documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I will hear the Parties on costs if there is no agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ignatius Joseph and Chong Xin Yi (Ignatius J &amp; Associates) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Abdul Rahman bin Mohd Hanipah and Mohammed Shakirin bin Abdul Rashid (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
