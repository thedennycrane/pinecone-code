<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of a
                    District Judge (the “DJ”) in <em>PP v Whang Sung
                        Lin</em> [2009] SGDC 308 (the “GD”). The
                    appellant was convicted and sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for an
                    offence under s 14(2) read with s 14(1) of the Human Organ Transplant
                    Act (Cap 131A, 2005 Rev Ed) (the “HOTA”) and with s 109 of
                    the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The appellant appealed against his
                    conviction and sentence. At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant’s
                    counsel was content to confine his oral arguments to the following two issues,
                    stating that he was not disputing the findings of fact by the DJ:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the charge (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> below) ought to have alleged abetment by aiding
                            rather than by instigation; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the sentence meted out was manifestly
                            excessive in the circumstances of the case.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">However, as the appeal against conviction remains on record and for
                    completeness, I shall deal with the factual disputes raised in the written
                    submissions as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charge and its elements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant was charged as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… that you, sometime between April 2008 and 19 June 2008, in
                        Singapore, did intentionally abet, by instigation, one Wang Chin Sing and
                        one Tang Wee Sung to enter into an arrangement in which the said Wang Chin
                        Sing would, for valuable consideration, procure a suitable living donor to
                        supply a kidney to the said Tang Wee Sung, to wit, by introducing the said
                        Tang Wee Sung to the said Wang Chin Sing in return for a fee, for the said
                        purpose, thereby abetting the said act, which act was committed in
                        consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence
                        punishable under Section 14(2) read with Section 14(1) of the
                        Human Organ Transplant Act, Chapter 131A read with Section 109 of
                        the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Section 14 of the HOTA reads as
                    follows:</p>

                        blood from his body or from the body of another person, whether before or
                        after his death or the death of the other person, as the case may be, shall
                        be void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A person who enters into a contract or arrangement of the kind
                        referred to in subsection (1) and to which that subsection applies shall be

                        exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or
                        to both</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The following facts were not disputed. The
                    appellant’s wife’s uncle, Tang Wee Sung (“Tang”), was
                    suffering from renal failure and required a kidney transplant. The appellant
                    knew one Wang Chin Sing (“Wang”) and that Wang was able to source
                    for willing kidney donors in return for fees paid to Wang and the donor. The
                    appellant then informed Tang that Wang may be able to help him source for a
                    kidney donor and gave Wang’s contact number to Tang. Through this
                    introduction, Tang contacted Wang in May 2008 and the two men met. Subsequently,
                    Tang and Wang entered into an agreement for Wang to source for a willing donor
                    to sell a kidney to Tang. Tang agreed to pay $300,000 for this arrangement. Wang
                    then approached one Sulaiman Damanik (“Sulaiman”), an Indonesian,
                    who agreed to sell one of his kidneys to Tang for 150m rupiah (or about
                    S$23,700). Another Indonesian man, one Toni, was recruited to act as a liaison
                    between Sulaiman and Wang. For his role, Toni would be paid 20m rupiah (or about
                    S$3,200).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 6 June 2008, Sulaiman arrived in
                    Singapore where he underwent preparatory steps for the kidney transplant.
                    Sulaiman was then coached by Wang to make a false statutory declaration stating
                    that he was related to Tang and was donating his kidney for no financial gain.
                    Sulaiman and Tang were also coached by Wang to provide false information before
                    the Transplant Ethics Committee panel (“the ethics committee”)
                    which then approved the application for the live kidney
                transplant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Meanwhile, on 30 May 2008, Wang issued a
                    cash cheque for $10,000 to the appellant. On 10 June 2008, Wang issued
                    another cash cheque for $10,000 to the appellant. The appellant did not deny
                    receiving the two amounts. He disputed only the purpose for which they were
                    given to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Subsequently, the parties involved in the kidney
                    sale transaction were charged, convicted and sentenced as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Sulaiman pleaded guilty to one charge under

                            arrangement to supply one of his kidneys for valuable consideration and
                            one charge under s14(1)(a)(ii) of the Oaths and Declarations Act

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings in the District Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Wang testified that in 2006, he became aware of
                    Tang’s kidney problems. However, he did not act on this knowledge.
                    Subsequently, he and the appellant became good friends and he mentioned
                    Tang’s condition to the appellant. The appellant knew that Wang had
                    previously charged fees for helping to find organ donors. The appellant was
                    aware of Tang’s condition and asked Wang to charge a fee if Tang needed a
                    kidney. However, nothing transpired from that conversation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     During a meeting in April 2008 initiated by
                    Wang, the appellant and Wang agreed that the appellant would pass Wang’s
                    number to Tang and Wang would arrange for a kidney donor for Tang in return for
                    a sum of $300,000, from which the appellant would receive around $100,000,
                    depending on the final expenses incurred. The appellant was the one who came up
                    with the figure of $300,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appellant duly passed Wang’s mobile
                    telephone number to Tang who then called Wang. Thus the contact between Wang and
                    Tang was made and Wang went to Tang’s home twice to discuss the matter.
                    Tang agreed to pay Wang $300,000 to get him a kidney donor. Pursuant to this
                    arrangement, Tang paid $50,000 on or around 12 May 2008 and $75,000 on or
                    around 3 June 2008 to Wang. From these cash payments, Wang made two advance
                    payments of $10,000 each (on 30 May 2008 and on 10 June 2008) to the
                    appellant. Wang also kept the appellant informed about the developments.
                    Subsequently, after police investigations into the kidney sale commenced, the
                    appellant attempted to return the $20,000 to Wang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Tang testified that on 2 May 2008, he
                    returned a call from the appellant. The appellant was aware of Tang’s
                    medical condition and that he was actively looking for a kidney donor. The
                    appellant informed Tang that Wang would be able to help him find a living donor
                    willing to sell his kidney. He then gave him Wang’s mobile telephone
                    number to Tang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After Tang was brought in by the police for
                    questioning, the appellant called him and, in a “strange
                    conversation” which was quite “garbled”, tried to borrow
                    money from him. The appellant also informed Tang that Wang offered to give
                    $100,000 to the appellant. The appellant sounded confused and
                desperate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The appellant refuted these allegations. The
                    appellant testified that Wang asked him for an introduction to Tang. The
                    appellant was not keen to do so as he was not close to Tang. Wang told the
                    appellant that without Wang’s help, Tang would die shortly. The appellant
                    then visited Tang and felt sorry for him. He therefore gave Wang’s mobile
                    telephone number to Tang and told Tang to call Wang if he wanted Wang’s
                    help. The appellant denied telling Wang to charge a fee or having received a
                    part of the fee. The appellant explained that the two $10,000 payments were
                    loans from Wang. The appellant denied telling Tang about Wang’s offer to
                    lend him $100,000. However, when cross-examined, the appellant claimed that Wang
                    did offer to give him $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the DJ </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The DJ found that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Wang and Tang were credible witnesses and that
                            any inconsistencies in their statements were immaterial;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellant suggested to Wang that Wang charge

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellant and Wang agreed that the appellant
                            would receive $100,000 from the $300,000;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellant did not visit Tang before deciding
                            to pass Wang’s mobile telephone number to him. Instead, the
                            appellant gave Wang’s number to Tang over a phone
                            conversation;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the $20,000 given by Wang to the appellant were
                            advance payments of the eventual profits due to the appellant. The
                            evidence supported this. Firstly, there was a contemporaneous record
                            kept by Wang of all the expenses relating to Tang’s kidney
                            transplant in which Wang recorded that two payments of $10,000 had been
                            made to the appellant. Secondly, the two payments were made soon after
                            Tang paid money to Wang, indicating that they were not loans but advance
                            payments to the appellant of his share of the fee. Thirdly, Wang kept
                            the appellant updated regarding the progress of Tang’s case,
                            suggesting the appellant’s continued interest in the matter;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">after the matter was exposed, the appellant
                            attempted to cover up his action by trying to return the $20,000 to Wang
                            and by telling Tang that Wang offered him $100,000 as a
                        loan.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Based on the evidence, the DJ found that the
                    appellant actively encouraged the kidney sale scheme by suggesting that Wang
                    procure a kidney for Tang for $300,000 and by introducing Tang to Wang. In
                    return, the appellant would receive $100,000 from Wang. Accordingly, the DJ
                    found the appellant guilty of the charge (set out at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As for the appropriate sentence, the DJ
                    considered the appellant’s mitigation plea, the sentences imposed on the
                    other parties involved and the objective of deterring other individuals from
                    acting as middlemen in organ trading. The DJ also considered the role played by
                    the appellant and found that the appellant was motivated by greed and was the
                    catalyst in bringing Tang and Wang together. He therefore sentenced the
                    appellant to 8 months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues raised on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     With respect to his conviction, the appellant
                    disputed the DJ s finding of facts, i.e. that Wang and Tang were credible
                    witnesses; that the inconsistencies in Wang’s and Tang’s evidence
                    were immaterial; that the appellant initiated the kidney sale scheme by
                    suggesting to Wang that he charge Tang $300,000 for procuring a kidney for him;
                    that the appellant would receive a monetary reward for his role in the scheme;
                    and that the cheques for $10,000 were advance payments and not
                loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     However, the appellant admitted that he did
                    introduce Wang to Tang. Therefore, the appellant contended that he should have
                    been charged for abetment by aiding and not abetment by instigating. He was
                    always willing to plead guilty to the charge if it had alleged abetment by
                    aiding rather than by instigating and the prosecution and the DJ were informed
                    as much at the outset of the trial. I asked Mr Subhas Anandan, counsel for
                    the appellant, whether the appellant would have pleaded guilty if the
                    prosecution had agreed to amend the charge to state abetment by aiding but
                    insisted that the appellant admit that he was to have received $100,000 as his
                    share in the transaction. Mr Subhas replied that they did not get to the
                    stage of discussing the issue of the $100,000 as they could not even cross the
                    first hurdle concerning the type of abetment. The prosecution contended that it
                    was the other way round – the $100,000 was the obstacle to a plea of
                    guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     With respect to the sentence, the appellant
                    contended that the DJ placed excessive emphasis on general deterrence and
                    insufficient weight on parity in sentencing and over-emphasised the
                    appellant’s role in the kidney sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appeal against conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The finding of facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In assessing the merits of the appeal, I was
                    mindful of the principle that since the DJ had the benefit of hearing the
                    evidence of the witnesses and observing their demeanour, an appellate judge must
                    defer to the findings of fact made by the DJ which are based on his assessment
                    of the witnesses, unless they are clearly wrong or wholly against the weight of
                    the evidence: see <em>Moganaruban s/o Subramaniam v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 121 at [14].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The appellant contended that the DJ erred in
                    finding that Wang and Tang were honest and credible witnesses. The appellant
                    also contended the DJ relied excessively on Tang’s and Wang’s
                    demeanour without carefully considering the material inconsistencies in their
                    evidence. In particular, the appellant highlighted that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Wang’s and Tang’s evidence regarding
                            (i) the date of their first meeting and (ii) who came up with the idea
                            of getting an Indonesian donor were contradictory; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Wang’s statements regarding (i) whether
                            Wang informed the appellant that he could help Tang; (ii) whether the
                            appellant came up with the $300,000 figure or whether it was a joint
                            decision made by the two of them; (iii) when the $300,000 figure was
                            first mentioned to Tang; and (iv) who fabricated the lies to the ethics
                            committee, were inconsistent.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The appellant further contended that there
                    were logical fallacies in Wang’s evidence, in particular, that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Wang would receive $60,000 - $70,000 from the
                            kidney sale transaction, a sum which was less than what the appellant
                            would have got; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">despite having the means to do so, Wang chose not
                            to act on Tang’s kidney failure earlier even though he knew about
                            it since 2006.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With respect to Tang’s evidence, the
                    appellant also asserted that Tang’s memory about the incident would have
                    been affected by his dire medical condition at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Having considered the evidence, I find no
                    reason to disturb the DJ’s findings. Firstly, there was no reason to doubt
                    the credibility of Wang and Tang. Both Wang and Tang had already pleaded guilty
                    to their respective charges and were duly convicted and sentenced. There was no
                    evidence to suggest that either had any motive to falsely implicate the
                    appellant. There was therefore no reason for them to lie in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Secondly, the prosecution’s case that
                    the appellant received monetary consideration for his role in the kidney sale
                    was supported by contemporaneous documentation. The prosecution adduced an
                    expense note (see above at [15(e)]) wherein Wang recorded the expenses and
                    deductions in respect of the arrangement with Tang. The expense note was seized
                    from Wang’s apartment by Senior Staff Sergeant Andy Ong Beng Teck in a
                    police raid on 19 June 2008. Two entries, which were boxed, recorded two
                    $10,000 payments to the appellant on two separate occasions. This was consistent
                    with Wang’s evidence that the money was paid to the appellant as advance
                    payments and not as loans and that he kept a detailed expense record in order to
                    account to the appellant the final expenses involved. Wang’s evidence was
                    also supported by the coincidence between the dates of Tang’s payments to
                    Wang and Wang’s payments to the appellant: see above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>. This was consistent with Wang’s
                    testimony that he kept the appellant regularly updated on the progress of
                    Tang’s case and that the appellant asked for advance payments from the
                    payments made by Tang to Wang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Thirdly, I agree with the DJ that the
                    inconsistencies in Wang’s and Tang’s statements were immaterial.
                    Wang and Tang’s disagreement over their respective involvement in the
                    scheme was irrelevant to the appellant’s culpability. Further, the courts
                    do give adequate allowance for the fallibility of human memory: see <em>Ng Kwee Leong v PP</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 281. As for
                    who came up with the $300,000 fee, there was also nothing inconsistent between
                    the appellant suggesting the figure of $300,000 and the appellant and Wang then
                    jointly agreeing on that amount. None of the alleged inconsistencies affected
                    the core of the prosecution’s case, i.e. that the appellant suggested
                    charging Tang $300,000 and that the appellant received monetary rewards for
                    introducing Tang to Wang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Fourthly, as for the alleged logical fallacies
                    in Wang’s evidence, I found that they were insufficient to cast doubt on
                    the reliability of his evidence. As noted above, Wang had pleaded guilty and was
                    already serving his sentence. There was no incentive for him to implicate the
                    appellant falsely. Whether Wang stood to gain more from the kidney sale or
                    whether the transaction with Tang could have gone through on an earlier date
                    without the appellant’s involvement has no bearing on the
                    appellant’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Finally, there was no evidence to suggest that
                    Tang, unwell as he was, was not lucid at the time of his conversations with the
                    appellant. I therefore see no reason to doubt the reliability of his
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In contrast, I find the appellant’s
                    claims to be unconvincing. There was no reason why the two amounts of $10,000
                    each would be recorded in the expense note had they been loans. There was
                    nothing to suggest a history of lending between Wang and the appellant. The
                    appellant further claimed under cross-examination that Wang volunteered to give
                    him $100,000. However, again, there was no apparent reason why Wang would do
                    such a thing on his own volition. I therefore find Wang’s and Tang’s
                    evidence to be much more credible than that of the
                appellant’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Abetment by instigation or abetment by aiding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In order to make good the offence of abetment
                    by instigation, the prosecution has to show the court that there was
                    ‘active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement’ of the
                    offence: <em>Balakrishnan S v Public Prosecutor</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 249 (“<em>Balakrishnan
                    S</em>”) at [66]. In <em>Balakrishnan S</em>,
                    the second appellant was the supervising officer of a combat survival training
                    course in the army. As a result of a water-dunking exercise, one trainee died
                    and another was seriously injured. The second appellant was charged with
                    abetment by instigation of a rash act causing death and of an act causing
                    grievous hurt. The appellant contended that he had discharged his duty by
                    setting limits for the training instructors. However, the court found that his
                    failure to intervene when he witnessed the maltreatment of the trainees even
                    though he was responsible for the safe conduct of the course was tantamount to
                    his support and encouragement of the offence, which was sufficient for a finding
                    of abetment by instigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The appellant contended that abetment by
                    aiding was a ‘lesser’ crime than abetment by instigation and that
                    the nature of the instigation must be such that there was an element of active
                    suggestion which caused the offence. The appellant contended that Wang was an
                    organ trader and Tang was a dying man and neither required instigation by the
                    appellant to participate in the illegal transaction. Therefore, by introducing
                    Tang to Wang, the appellant asserted that he was only guilty of abetting by
                    aiding, not by instigating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The prosecution relied on the following facts
                    to support its allegation of abetment by instigation:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Wang informed the appellant about Tang’s
                            medical condition;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellant told Wang to charge Tang a higher
                            fee because he is a rich man. While everyone may know that Tang is
                            wealthy, the appellant was goading Wang to arrange the
                        deal;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">at the meeting when the appellant’s share
                            of the fee was agreed, it was the appellant who suggested the fee of
                            $300,000 after Wang had set out the expenses to be incurred in the whole
                            transaction;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellant told Wang that he would go to see
                            Tang and he asked Wang for his (Wang’s) mobile telephone number,
                            telling Wang that when Tang calls, please help him; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellant did call Tang (although he asserted
                            that it was a visit to Tang’s home) and he gave Wang’s
                            mobile telephone number to Tang.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In any event, the prosecution argued, there was no suggestion by the DJ
                    that an offence of abetment by aiding would necessarily have attracted a more
                    lenient sentence than one involving abetment by instigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I note first of all that the charge (see
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) referred to the introduction
                    of Tang to Wang in return for a fee as the only act of instigation. Looking at
                    the facts adduced before the DJ, it appears to me to be a strain on language to
                    describe what the appellant did in this case as ‘active suggestion,
                    support, stimulation or encouragement’ (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). Tang desperately needed a kidney and was willing
                    and able to pay for one. In his words, “I was actively looking for a
                    kidney donor”. For Tang, it was a matter of life and death or, at least,
                    of having hope of an infinitely better quality of life after a transplant. Wang
                    was known to be someone willing and able to source for a kidney donor in return
                    for payment. Wang must be aware of Tang’s wealth and that his predicament
                    would cause him to be willing to part with a large amount of money in exchange
                    for a kidney. There could be no reason why Wang would need encouragement or
                    goading to ‘help’ Tang find a kidney donor. Both were obviously
                    eager to engage in the transaction. The only snag was that Tang did not know
                    about Wang and Wang somehow did not know how to approach Tang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With the entrance of Tang’s
                    nephew-in-law (i.e. the appellant) onto the stage, the link between the
                    ‘trader’ and the ‘buyer’ could be established. The
                    meetings that the appellant had with Wang could not be anything more than
                    discussions about what reward the appellant would receive for introducing Tang
                    to Wang and perhaps some explanation by Wang about the process of and the amount
                    of time needed for getting a kidney donor. The only ‘goading’ that
                    the appellant did was to ask Wang to charge a higher fee than normal. This was
                    understandable because the buyer was a wealthy but not healthy man and there was
                    going to be another intermediary (i.e. the appellant) who wanted to have a cut
                    of the profits. The higher the fee quoted and received by Wang, the greater the
                    profits for Wang and the appellant as well. However, it would be naïve to think
                    that Wang, a seasoned ‘trader’ in this field, had not already
                    intended to charge Tang much more for his services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On these facts, what was the appellant’s
                    role – a mere conduit or a catalyst? In ordinary parlance, one would
                    accurately describe the appellant’s acts of calling Tang to inform him
                    that Wang would be able to help him find a person willing to sell his kidney and
                    of passing Wang’s mobile telephone number to Tang as acts of information
                    and introduction. He did not urge Tang to call Wang immediately and certainly
                    did not need to goad Tang into doing so. It was Tang who called Wang the same
                    day without persuasion or encouragement. Wang was the glimmer of hope that Tang
                    was searching for and Tang was the big-time client that Wang (or any middleman
                    dealing in the organ trade) was looking for - two willing parties, one earnestly
                    waiting for a better life and the other eagerly wanting to make a good
                    living.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The appellant was therefore helping to put the
                    two willing parties together or ‘intentionally aiding’ them within
                    the meaning of s 107(c) of the Penal Code. He could hardly be said to be
                    ‘actively suggesting, supporting, stimulating or encouraging’ them
                    to do the transaction, although his wish must be that they would do so and at
                    the price agreed between him and Wang earlier. As mentioned above, neither Tang
                    nor Wang needed any goading or encouragement. They only needed to be introduced
                    to each other and everything flowed smoothly and quickly from then on without
                    any input from the appellant. The only goading that the appellant did was to
                    tell Wang to charge more in Tang’s case but that was in the context of
                    ‘If Tang needed a kidney, (the appellant) asked me to charge a fee’.
                    It was certainly not to urge a reluctant or ambivalent Wang to enter into the
                    transaction. It was at the meeting (at the Ya Kun food outlet at Funan Centre)
                    when the appellant was going to pass Wang’s mobile telephone number to
                    Tang that the figure of $300,000 was suggested by the appellant and agreed
                    between him and Wang. If the suggestion to charge $300,000 was an instigation,
                    it is clear that the illegal transaction was not ‘committed in consequence
                    of the instigation’ (see the words in the Explanation to s 109 of the
                    Penal Code at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above) as Wang was already
                    going to do the transaction if Tang should call, with or without that
                    suggestion. As mentioned above, the suggestion came about only because Tang was
                    a wealthy man and both Wang and the appellant obviously hoped to make as much
                    money out of his ill health as possible. Clearly, the offence was committed
                    ‘with the aid’ (see again the words in the Explanation to s 109
                    and also Explanation 2 in s 107 of the Penal Code at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above) or help of the appellant in introducing
                    Tang to Wang in return for a fee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As agreed by the prosecution and counsel for
                    the appellant during oral submissions, if I decide that the charge should have
                    stated abetment by intentionally aiding rather than by instigating, I should
                    amend the charge accordingly but the conviction is to stand without any need to
                    read the amended charge to the appellant. As I am of the view that the acts of
                    the appellant amounted to aiding rather than instigating, I now amend the charge
                    (at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) by deleting the words
                    ‘intentionally abet, by instigation’ appearing in the second line
                    thereof and substituting the words ‘abet, by intentionally aiding’.
                    The conviction is to stand even with such amendment. There is no scope for the
                    appellant to argue that he would have pleaded guilty to the charge had it been
                    amended in the way I just did because it was evident throughout the trial and
                    even on appeal that the appellant did not accept that he was to have received
                    payment for his role, something the prosecution would not compromise
                on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In any case, the appellant is not correct in
                    suggesting that abetment by aiding is a lesser crime than abetment by
                    instigation. Although it is established that for the purposes of sentencing, the
                    extent of the accused person’s role in the offence is a relevant
                    consideration (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala
                        Waduge Malitha Kumar</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [44]-[45]),
                    there is no reason why a person who aids in an offence is necessarily less
                    morally culpable than one who instigates the offence. Section 107 of the
                    Penal Code draws no distinction among the three categories of abetment and
                    s 109 does not make any distinction in the court’s sentencing powers
                    with respect to an offence of abetment by aiding and an offence of abetment by
                    instigation. The legal culpability remains the same for the three forms of
                    abetment. Ultimately, the court has to examine the role played by an accused
                    person in any particular set of facts. One who aids by practically paving the
                    groundwork for an offence may well be punished more severely than one who merely
                    instigates the commission thereof by a nod or a nudge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal against sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The appellate court’s scope for
                    interfering with sentences meted out by a lower court in the exercise of its
                    discretion is limited. However, an appellate court is entitled to correct a
                    sentence where (a) the sentencing judge has erred as to the proper factual basis
                    for the sentence; (b) the sentencing judge has failed to appreciate the material
                    placed before him; (c) the sentence imposed is wrong in principle and/or law;
                    and (d) the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive: <em>Angliss
                        Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 653 at [13].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The appellant contended that the DJ placed
                    undue emphasis on the principle of general deterrence. However, while there are
                    other principles of sentencing, i.e. retribution, prevention and rehabilitation,
                    the court has to assess how much weight to accord to each principle in each
                    case: see <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2009] SGCA 57 at [54]. In cases where the accused acted as a
                    middleman in organ trading, I agree with the DJ that the primary sentencing
                    consideration is that of general deterrence. This was established by V K
                    Rajah JA in the related case of <em>Wang Chin Sing v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 870. In dismissing
                    Wang’s appeal against his sentence, V K Rajah JA made the
                    following comments:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    … The appellant has peddled deceit,
                            trafficked in organs and profiteered from misery… the primary
                            sentencing consideration in this matter ought to be that of general
                            deterrence and not retribution. This is to firmly deter other
                            individuals contemplating acting as middlemen in organ-trading in
                            Singapore. While it can be said that HOTA does not currently single out
                            the role of the middleman, it appears to me, for the broad reasons I
                            have given earlier, that the middleman’s role should, as a matter
                            of sentencing policy, be accorded prominence. The sentences imposed by
                            the district judge sufficiently articulate, for now, the unambiguous
                            message that organ trafficking will not be tolerated in
                            Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The appellant further contended that the
                    purpose of general deterrence has already been fulfilled with the public’s
                    knowledge of the present tough stance against organ trading. However, general
                    deterrence aims not only to educate, but also to prevent other like-minded
                    persons from committing the same offence. This is best fulfilled by both
                    Parliament and the courts taking a tough stance against the particular crime
                    sought to be eradicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The appellant also contended that the DJ erred
                    in his characterisation of the appellant’s role in the scheme. The
                    appellant reiterated his claims that he was not an instigator and that he did
                    not receive a monetary reward for his role. As a consequence, he argued, when
                    sentencing the appellant, the DJ failed to consider the true extent of the
                    appellant’s culpability and therefore the appellant’s sentence was
                    excessive. I have already stated my views on instigating as compared to aiding
                    (see <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above) and have agreed with the
                    DJ’s finding that the appellant did receive payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It has been said that deterrence must be
                    tempered by proportionality in relation to the severity of the offence committed
                    as well as by the moral and legal culpability of the offender: <em>Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 10 at [31]. It has also been established that where two or
                    more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, their
                    sentences should be similar unless there is relevant difference in their
                    culpability for the offence or in their personal circumstances: <em>Public Prosecutor v Ramlee</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 95
                    at [7]. I reiterate the sentences meted out to the other parties involved in the
                    scheme, in descending order of severity of punishment in the imprisonment terms
                    (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Wang: 14 months’ imprisonment in total for
                            the 5 charges against him, with another 5 charges taken into
                            consideration (7 months’ imprisonment for the charge which the
                            appellant was involved in).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Toni: 3 months’ imprisonment for the 3

                            of $1,000 (in default 1 week’s imprisonment) for one charge each

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Both parties agreed that Tang’s and
                    Sulaiman’s cases ought not to be used for comparison as their
                    circumstances were exceptional and deserving of sympathy. I agree. Where Wang
                    was concerned, the appellant highlighted that the DJ who sentenced him commented
                    that he played a major role in the arrangement and that he was the ‘prime
                    mover’. V K Rajah JA who heard Wang’s appeal (see
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above) also commented that Wang had
                    to bear the lion’s share of the stigma of culpability. In Toni’s
                    case, the sentencing judge described him as a runner for the organ trading
                    syndicate and having a material role. The appellant submitted that Toni was more
                    culpable than him and that he (the appellant) should have received a sentence of
                    only about 3 months’ imprisonment or slightly more. The prosecution
                    pointed out that all the related parties pleaded guilty to their respective
                    charges while the appellant claimed trial and appealed against conviction.
                    Wang’s imprisonment term of 7 months for the relevant offence was
                    therefore already a discounted sentence. Accordingly, the appellant should not
                    receive less than what was meted out to Wang. The prosecution also pointed out
                    that Toni received only $3,200 for his role as compared to the appellant who was
                    to have received $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In my view, insufficient weight was given to
                    parity in sentencing in the appellant’s case. The appellant stood to
                    benefit far more financially than Toni but the appellant’s role was a very
                    limited one and stopped completely after that telephone call to Tang. Although
                    the appellant and Wang were supposed to have got $100,000 each from the illegal
                    transaction, Wang was clearly the one who assembled the orchestra, conducted it
                    and taught it to play his composition of deceit. Further, Wang was charged with
                    two counts under s 14(2) read with s 14(1) of HOTA and had other
                    charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing while the
                    appellant was convicted on only one charge. However, the appellant was the only
                    one among the players who claimed trial and, as mentioned in <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above, he would not have pleaded guilty even
                    if the charge had alleged abetment by aiding instead of instigation. Looking at
                    all the circumstances, I do not think that the appellant’s level of
                    culpability for the sole charge should be higher than or even close to that of
                    Wang for the corresponding charge. However, the maximum fine of $10,000 would
                    not be adequate punishment in this case as the potential gain was $100,000 and
                    the appellant had already received $20,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Balancing the need for general deterrence with
                    parity in sentencing, I now reduce the appellant’s sentence from eight
                    months’ imprisonment to four months. I emphasize here that the reduction
                    in sentence has nothing to do with the amendment I made to the charge. The
                    appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed while the appeal against
                    sentence is allowed to the extent mentioned. The charge is amended in the manner
                    indicated in <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As the Lunar New Year is two days away, I am
                    willing to consider any reasonable request by the appellant for a postponement
                    of sentence. This act of compassion is something our courts have always accorded
                    to people having to serve imprisonment sentences just before major festivals or
                    important events in their lives.</p>
