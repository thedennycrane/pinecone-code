<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties, Mr Wong Kien
                    Keong (“the Plaintiff”) and Mdm Khoo Hoon Eng
                    (“the Defendant”), divorced after more than 28
                    years of marriage. Before the hearing of the ancillary
                    proceedings relating to the maintenance and the division of
                    the matrimonial assets, the Defendant filed Summons No 1553
                    of 2011 (“SUM 1553/2011”) for an order that a
                    Deed of Separation dated 28 March 2003 entered into by
                    the parties (“the Deed”) be set aside or, in
                    the alternative, for a declaration that the same is void and
                    unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronology of procedural applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       SUM 1553/2011 was dismissed
                    on 21 March 2012. I held that there were no vitiating
                    factors to invalidate the Deed. As such, it was a valid
                    agreement and the Deed would be a factor to be taken into
                    consideration in the division of the matrimonial assets
                    pursuant to s 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter (Cap
                    353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
                Charter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The hearing of the ancillary
                    matters started immediately after my decision on SUM
                    1553/2011. I asked counsel for the Defendant, Ms Suchitra
                    Ragupathy (“Ms Ragupathy”), to explain why the
                    terms of the Deed should be given little weight. In other
                    words, what were the Defendant’s reasons for
                    maintaining that the division of the matrimonial assets in
                    the Deed was disadvantageous to the Defendant, and how was
                    it unreasonable in the circumstances of this present case? I
                    also wanted to know how much the Defendant was getting under
                    the Deed – was it 20% of the total assets as indicated
                    in the Plaintiff’s e-mail of 21 March 2003 (see
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> below), or at
                    least 40% of the matrimonial assets as stated in the
                    Plaintiff’s affidavit of 9 December
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It
                    turned out to be a fairly short hearing as there was no
                    affidavit evidence on the purchase price of the properties
                    and the financial contributions each had made to complete
                    the sale and purchase of the properties. An adjournment of
                    the hearing was granted to enable the parties to provide the
                    missing information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At that point, Ms Ragupathy,
                    who was understandably keen not to be caught “out of
                    time” if the Defendant wished to appeal, expressed
                    concern that given the time required for lodging an appeal
                    against my decision in SUM 1553/2011 and that the ancillary
                    proceedings would not be concluded within a month with the
                    adjournment. Ordinarily, pursuant to O 57 r 4(a)
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“the ROC”), the Defendant has to file and
                    serve her Notice of Appeal within one month from the date of
                    dismissal of SUM 1553/2011 (<em>ie</em>, 21 March 2012), if she wishes to
                    appeal. Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Randolph Khoo
                    (“Mr Khoo”), had no objection with an order
                    for the time for lodging an appeal against my decision on
                    SUM 1553/2011 to run after a decision on the ancillaries was
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Therefore, I exercised my
                    power under O 57 r 17 of the ROC and ordered that
                    the time for appeal in respect of SUM 1553/2011 was to run
                    from the time of the orders for the ancillary matters. The
                    intention was clear: in the event of an appeal to the Court
                    of Appeal, both SUM 1553/2011 and the orders made on the
                    ancillary matters should go up on appeal together and at the
                    same time. Hence, the exact wording of my order, as it
                    appears in the Notes of Arguments, is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Time will run from the time the division of
                        matrimonial assets is decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 3 April 2012, Ms
                    Ragupathy filed the Defendant’s Notice of Appeal
                    against the dismissal of SUM 1553/2011 <em>vide</em> CA 32 of 2012/S (“CA
                    32/2012”). On 18 April 2012, Ms Ragupathy filed
                    Summons No 1904 of 2012 (“SUM 1904/2012”) to
                    stay the ancillary proceedings pending the outcome of CA
                    32/2012. SUM 1904/2012 has not yet been heard. I should
                    mention that allied to SUM 1904/2012 is the question of
                    whether CA 32/2012 was filed prematurely. Needless to say,
                    these matters will be fully argued when SUM 1904/2012 is
                    next listed for hearing before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For now, I will explain in
                    detail the reasons for the dismissal of SUM
                    1553/2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties to the Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The parties were married on
                    10 December 1977 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They have
                    two sons to the marriage. Their sons are now 27 and 30 years
                    old respectively. The parties are highly educated, bright
                    and accomplished individuals. They have been extremely
                    successful in their respective careers, and they continue to
                    do well. By all counts, they were an exceptional couple. The
                    Plaintiff is a well-known legal personality in the legal
                    profession. The Defendant is an eminent academician. She is
                    currently teaching at the National University of Singapore
                    (“NUS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the time of their
                    marriage, the Plaintiff had graduated from Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology, and the Defendant obtained a Ph.D
                    from St Mary’s Hospital, University of London. Both
                    were university lecturers in Malaysia and they lived in
                    Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 5 June 1981, the elder son
                    was born.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In October 1982, the
                    Plaintiff obtained a Commonwealth fellowship to pursue his
                    doctorate degree in engineering at Imperial College in
                    London. The Plaintiff also concurrently enrolled to read law
                    at Oxford University.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Defendant took a
                    sabbatical for a year from October 1982 to August 1983 to be
                    with the Plaintiff and the family in Oxford. In August 1983,
                    the Defendant returned to Kuala Lumpur with the elder son
                    and returned to lecturing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In July 1984, the
                    Plaintiff completed his law studies at Oxford University and
                    returned to Kuala Lumpur. On 22 August 1984, the
                    younger son was born. The Plaintiff returned to London to
                    study for the UK Bar Examinations in October 1984. In August
                    1985, the Plaintiff returned to Kuala Lumpur after passing
                    the UK Bar Examinations. He also completed his doctorate
                    thesis in December 1985 in Malaysia. He then went on to
                    chamber as a pupil at Shearn &amp; Delamore, a Malaysian law
                    firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In July 1987, the
                    Plaintiff moved to Singapore to work for a foreign law firm
                    at its Singapore office. Later in December 1987, the
                    Defendant moved with the children to Singapore after the
                    Defendant was employed by the NUS. The Plaintiff was made a
                    local partner of the foreign firm in June 1989 and an
                    international partner in 1993. After moving to Singapore,
                    the parties enjoyed good fortune and in the course of the
                    marriage acquired various properties and
                investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sometime in November 2002,
                    the Defendant confessed to the Plaintiff that she had an
                    affair with her colleague. Their marriage subsequently fell
                    apart.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 12 March 2003, the
                    parties separated. The Defendant moved out of the
                    couple’s residence at Blk 130 Tanjong Rhu Road,
                    #12-02, Pebble Bay, Singapore to live in an apartment at
                    Aspen Heights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After living apart, the
                    parties signed the Deed on 28 March 2003. The
                    circumstances surrounding the place and time the Defendant
                    signed the Deed was contested by the parties. In my view,
                    nothing significant turned on the discrepancies in light of
                    the undisputed evidence that the Defendant looked perfectly
                    normal at the Plaintiff’s birthday dinner on
                    28 March 2003 and did not appear to be
                    depressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Defendant filed a
                    divorce petition on 29 June 2004 which was later
                    discontinued on 20 March 2006. The Plaintiff then filed
                    a divorce petition on 28 March 2006. The decree nisi
                    dissolving the marriage was granted on 28 May
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ opposing positions in SUM
                1553/2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Ms Ragupathy argued that
                    the Deed should be set aside because the Defendant was
                    coerced, abused and/or threatened into signing the
                        Deed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Ms Ragupathy further
                    argued that the Defendant was suffering from depression at
                    the material time such that she did not fully understand the
                    consequences and risks of signing the Deed, and that the
                    Defendant signed the Deed in the hope that acceding to the
                    Plaintiff’s requests as set out in the Deed would
                    result in reconciliation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Ms Ragupathy pointed
                    to various allegations of abuse made by the Defendant in her
                    affidavits and relied on a report prepared by one Dr Pushpa
                    Bose (“Dr Bose”), the Defendant’s
                    psychiatrist, which tried to shed light on the
                    Defendant’s mental state at the time she signed the
                    Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the other hand, Mr Khoo
                    argued that the Deed was not tainted by any vitiating
                    factors. According to Mr Khoo, the Defendant knew the legal
                    significance of the Deed as she obtained legal advice on the
                    Deed and admitted that she understood the effect of the Deed
                    in one of her e-mails to the Plaintiff. It was pointed out
                    that the Defendant was not a simple woman. She had excellent
                    credentials and a range of accomplishments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant was also actively bargaining over the split of
                        assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Mr Khoo rejected the
                    Defendant’s allegation that she signed the Deed
                    because the Plaintiff made a false promise that he would
                    reconcile with her if she did so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Mr Khoo
                    noted that the Defendant’s allegations of abuse

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevant legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is not controversial
                    that for a pre-nuptial or post nuptial agreement
                    (collectively referred to hereinafter as “marital
                    agreement”) to have the effect of a valid and
                    subsisting agreement, it should satisfy the requirements of
                    the law of contract: see <em>Chia Hock Hua v
                        Chong Choo Je</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 159. The Court
                    of Appeal in <em>TQ v TR and Another
                        appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 (“<em>TQ v TR</em>”), affirmed that for
                    a pre-nuptial agreement to subsist, it must comply with the
                    requirements of the law of contract. Andrew Phang JA’s
                    observations in <em>TQ v TR</em> apply
                    equally to post nuptial agreements like the Deed in this
                    case, and they are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94 It is our view that prenuptial agreements ought
                        generally to comply with the various legal doctrines and
                        requirements that are an integral part of the common law
                        of contract. ... This is only logical as well as just
                        and fair, given that such agreements are, <em>ex hypothesi</em>,<em>contracts</em> to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96 The prenuptial agreement in question must obviously
                        have been <em>validly formed</em>
                        in the first place in accordance with the general rules
                        and principles relating to offer and acceptance (and see
                        the decision of this court in <em>Wee Ah
                            Lian)</em>. Hence, for example, an absence of
                        a requisite offer or acceptance would be fatal to any
                        reliance on an alleged prenuptial agreement as it would
                        not have come into proper legal existence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As marital agreements are
                    not commercial contracts, the court retains a residuary
                    discretion even though the marital agreement does not comply
                    with the legal doctrines of contract law to give some weight
                    to the marital agreement where the circumstances justify it.
                    Phang JA remarked (at [105]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...The court also retains a residuary discretion, in
                        limited circumstances, to give <em>some</em> weight to a prenuptial agreement
                        that does not comply with one or more of the legal
                        doctrine and requirements under the common law of
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I now come to another
                    related point, namely the presence of any of the standard
                    vitiating factors such as duress, fraud or misrepresentation
                    that will negate the marital agreement. Phang JA in
                        <em>TQ v TR</em> identified various
                    vitiating factors. They include (at [97]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the other end of the contractual spectrum are to be
                        found the various <em>vitiating
                            factors.</em> These include standard
                        contractual doctrines such as misrepresentation,
                        mistake, undue influence, duress, unconscionability, as
                        well as illegality and public policy...[including] the
                        possibility of ‘saving’ that part of the
                        prenuptial agreement that is objectionable via the
                        doctrine of severance... There has also been mention of
                        the safeguard relating to the availability of
                        independent legal advice...</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     With these principles in
                    mind, I now turn to the facts of this case, and the
                    vitiating factors raised by the Defendant in argument,
                    namely the Defendant was coerced, abused and/or threatened
                    into signing the Deed or that she did not understand the
                    consequences and risks of signing the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Defendant
                        alleged<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    that after the Defendant confessed to having her affair in
                    November 2002, the Plaintiff, at various times and amongst
                    other things, threatened to report the affair to the Dean of
                    her faculty and Vice-Chancellor of the NUS and get the
                    Defendant sacked, urinated on the Defendant and made her
                    drink his urine, verbally and physically abused the
                    Defendant and made her do degrading acts and humiliated the
                    Defendant’s mother by asking her to kneel and beg for
                    forgiveness from the Plaintiff. The Defendant alleged that
                    by January 2003, she was completely broken and in a state of
                    depression, she suffered from insomnia and experienced
                    significant weight loss.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Defendant adduced a
                    police report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    made by her on 17 October 2003 stating the various
                    incidents of violence involving the Plaintiff between
                    November 2002 and January 2003 and in September 2003, as
                    well as photos of mobile messages purportedly sent by an
                    apologetic Plaintiff on 7 January 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The Defendant also
                    filed an affidavit of her son<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and
                    her brother<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> in
                    support of her allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Furthermore, to shed light
                    on the Defendant’s alleged state of mind at the time
                    she signed the Deed, it is useful to quote from a relevant
                    paragraph in the Defendant’s Affidavit dated
                    25 January 2008 wherein the Defendant proffered her
                    reasons for signing the Deed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69. After years of being abused by the [Plaintiff], I
                        was very afraid he would carry out his threats
                            [<em>ie</em>, to make public
                        the Defendant’s affair, have her sacked and to
                        make it impossible for her to live in
                            Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>] and at the material
                        point in time, I was not able to stand up for myself,
                        and neither did I have any support from friends and
                        family. I eventually broke, and signed the Deed without
                        addressing my mind to it, or the consequences of the
                        same. I had also signed it to please the [Plaintiff],
                        and in the hope that we would be able to reconcile. I
                        did not have the courage or the strength to re-order my
                        life after being with the [Plaintiff] for 25 years, and
                        as such, I was prepared to do anything to reconcile with
                        him. The [Plaintiff] had told me that if I signed the
                        Deed, he would consider reconciling with me. The
                        relevant e-mail dated 6<sup>th</sup> of
                        March 2003 is at pages xxx to xxx of Exhibit KHE
                        -53.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In response, the Plaintiff
                    categorically denied all the Defendant’s
                        allegations,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and
                    relied on affidavits of his relatives like his

                    attest to various matters: that the Plaintiff was not a
                    violent and cruel man; and that the Defendant looked
                    perfectly normal at the Plaintiff’s birthday dinner on
                    28 March 2003 and she did not display any signs of
                    depression. As to the Defendant’s character, she has
                    been described by the Plaintiff and his relatives as
                    strong-willed with a very strong mind of her
                        own;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the absence of
                    contemporaneous and objective evidence, the allegations of
                    physical abuse were basically not satisfactorily
                    corroborated. The Defendant’s police report narrated
                    various violent acts committed by the Plaintiff on her
                    person between November 2002 and January 2003. Notably, the
                    police report was only made on 17 October 2003 several
                    months after the alleged violent incidents took place. Mr
                    Khoo questioned the veracity of the police report and, to
                    support his contention, he went through some e-mails written
                    by the Defendant around the time of the alleged incidents to
                    show that none of the e-mails alluded to anything untoward.
                    I note that the police report was made after the Defendant
                    had engaged a firm of lawyers to commence divorce
                    proceedings in August 2003<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>,
                    and the Defendant, in fact, confirmed in her affidavit that
                    it was her then lawyers who had advised her to file the
                    police report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>
                    Indeed her Divorce Petition No 2545 of 2004 (“DT 2545
                    of 2004”) filed on 29 June 2004 was based,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, on the
                    Plaintiff’s unreasonable behaviour. DT 2545 of 2004
                    was eventually withdrawn by agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> As for the other
                    affidavits provided by the Defendant, the son in his
                    affidavit stopped short of saying that he saw or knew that
                    the Defendant was physically abused; instead, the son only
                    claimed that he saw bruises on the Defendant’s arm in
                    the period between November 2002 and January 2003.
                    Similarly, the Defendant’s brother in his affidavit
                    only claimed to have seen a bruise on the Defendant’s
                    lip and stated that the Defendant told him that the
                    Plaintiff had caused the bruise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Taking the
                    Defendant’s case at its highest, that is, the alleged
                    abuses did happen (which I make no finding on), it must
                    still be shown that the Defendant signed the Deed out of
                    fear of her safety and well being. Or that she was so
                    traumatised that she was incapable of understanding or
                    appreciating the legal effect of the Deed. It is accepted
                    that the psychological effect of repeated abuse can have a
                    lingering effect in that the person may well continue to be
                    traumatised and mentally affected by abuse he or she
                    suffered over a period of time or even a long time ago. In
                    the final analysis, what is important is whether the
                    Defendant was in fact too affected and depressed to think
                    clearly and rationally and to appreciate the legal
                    significance of the Deed when she signed it on 28 March
                    2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In this regard, there is
                    overwhelming evidence pointing to the fact, and I so find,
                    that the Defendant had appreciated the legal significance of
                    the Deed and was not coerced, abused or threatened into
                    signing the Deed. The exchange of e-mails between the
                    parties at or about the time of the signing of the Deed on
                    28 March 2003 is material; it showed that the Defendant
                    perfectly understood and appreciated the significance and
                    effect of the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In particular, an e-mail
                    titled “separation matters” sent by the
                    Defendant to the Plaintiff on 21 March 2003, just seven
                    days before the signing of the Deed, is important. It
                    clearly showed that the Defendant knew the legal
                    repercussions of signing the Deed in that it was going to be
                    binding, that she was not getting 50% of the matrimonial
                    assets, and that since she was entitled to 50%, it was
                    difficult for her to accept what he had proposed. The
                    salient parts of the e-mail are quoted below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dearest Wong,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I also did not understand what a separation agreement
                        meant or implied. I thought it was a temporary agreement
                        such that we could work towards reconciliation. I talked
                        to my cousin about it and she consulted a lawyer.
                            <em>I now understand that it is a
                            binding agreement if we eventually get

                            <em>The lawyer’s advice was

                        I was only interested in getting enough for me to live
                        for the rest of my life without financial difficulty,
                        the advice was that I should not just think about myself
                        alone but also my children because I should also have
                        the right to give them my share of the matrimonial
                        assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore to protect our sons’ interest too, I
                        think you should recognise my entitlement to half share
                        of our matrimonial assets so that I can bequeath this
                        half share to our sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To insist that I should comply with the way you have
                        proposed that our matrimonial assets should be divided
                        would be very unfair to me, particularly, when you
                        reserve the right to withdraw whatever you propose to
                        give me based only on your perception of any failure on
                        my part to meet with your expectations of the manner I
                        conduct my life. <em>For the purpose of
                            this separation agreement, as far as the matrimonial
                            assets are concerned, I therefore find it very
                            difficult to comply with your
                        request.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now that you insisted on the separation and clear
                        division of the matrimonial assets, <em>you should recognise my basic rights as a wife that
                            I am entitled to at least 50% of whatever we have

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am very annoyed by your letter below as I have
                        stated over the phone. There is no split of 50% to you.
                        I do not agree and will never agree. The only way for
                        you to hope to achieve that is for us to have a full
                        blown legal dispute over our matrimonial assets. This
                        will mean that there will be no holds barred and I will
                        disclose all the unsavoury aspects of our marriage to
                        the public. I do not mind that if you wish to fight me.

                        assets as of end 2002 to you, it would be a fair split.
                        The proposal that I gave you had more than a 20% split.
                        In addition, there are some ongoing payments by me which
                        will stop should you be out with another man or are

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As can be seen from the
                    excerpts above, the Defendant herself stated that the
                    intended separation agreement would be “a binding
                    agreement if [the parties] eventually get divorced”
                    and was openly bargaining for a larger share of the
                    matrimonial assets a few days before the Deed was signed.
                    The Plaintiff indicated clearly in his reply to the
                    Defendant that the Deed would be “binding”.
                    The Defendant’s e-mail is telling. It showed that she
                    had put thought into her e-mail. It showed that she was not
                    afraid to speak up and indeed told the Plaintiff that she
                    wanted a larger share of the matrimonial assets, and sought
                    to justify her stand. This e-mail militated against the
                    Defendant’s claim that she was not thinking, was
                    irrational and incapable of appreciating the legal
                    significance of the Deed. After the Deed was executed, the
                    Defendant even made enquiries together with the Plaintiff to
                    begin to carry out the terms of the Deed, as seen from an
                    e-mail from the Defendant to the Plaintiff dated
                    10 April 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I am aware that the
                    Plaintiff is a lawyer and had drafted the Deed. Nonetheless,
                    I was satisfied on the evidence before me that the Defendant
                    signed the Deed with full appreciation of its implications.
                    There was no lack of legal advice for the reasons stated
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Plaintiff alleged in
                    his affidavits that the Defendant received legal advice on
                    the Deed from at least two sources, namely Peter Moe
                    (“Peter”) and the lawyer friend of her
                        cousin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Peter, a family friend, gave
                    the Plaintiff at the latter’s request a specimen copy
                    of a deed of separation. The Plaintiff’s draft was
                    shown to Peter who confirmed that he spoke to the Defendant
                    on various occasions about the draft including the finalised
                    version. He also stated in his affidavits that he told the
                    Defendant on numerous occasions before the signing of the
                    Deed to seek independent legal advice,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> and that he
                    actually explained to the Defendant the purport of the Deed
                    which was a contract between her and the Plaintiff and that
                    if they divorced, the terms of the Deed would be reviewed by
                    the court and could be upheld if found to be
                        fair.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>
                    However, the Defendant alleged in her affidavit that she did
                    not receive any legal advice on the Deed but she did inform
                    the Plaintiff that her cousin had sought legal advice on her
                        behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She
                    insisted that she never received any legal advice from
                        Peter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> In
                    her reply affidavit to Peter’s first affidavit, she
                    alleged again that she did not receive any legal advice from
                        Peter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> However, the
                    Defendant’s telephone records<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> from
                    1 February 2003 to 31 March 2003 clearly showed
                    that the Defendant did have conversations with Peter on
                    numerous occasions in the period leading up to the signing
                    of the Deed. The telephone records from 1 February to
                    27 March 2003 showed that there were at least 27
                    telephone conversations between Peter and the Defendant. It
                    is worth noting that the Defendant in her reply affidavit to
                    Peter’s affidavit neglected to mention the various
                    telephone calls between the Defendant and Peter made before
                    27 March 2003 and instead selectively focused on the
                    calls made on 27 March 2003 to show that Peter did not
                    advise her on the subject matter of the Deed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> What exactly
                    was said between Peter and the Defendant in all the phone
                    calls was disputed as can be seen from the differing
                    accounts of Peter and the Defendant in their respective
                    affidavits, but the incontrovertible fact is that Peter and
                    the Defendant did have numerous conversations up till the
                    signing of the Deed. The Defendant’s neglect to
                    explain what transpired in the telephone conversations
                    before 27 March 2003 gave credence to Peter’s
                    assertions that he explained to the Defendant the effect of
                    the draft separation deed, his views on its terms as
                    requested by the Defendant as well as reminded her to obtain
                    independent legal advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At any rate, in light of
                    her e-mail to the Plaintiff quoted above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>, the Defendant was
                    content to accept and rely on the legal advice communicated
                    through her cousin who consulted a lawyer on the
                    Defendant’s entitlement to the matrimonial assets and
                    the legal significance of the Deed. This legal advice was
                    specifically in relation to Singapore law. The Defendant
                    herself wrote in the e-mail that “the lawyer’s
                    advice was that under Singapore law, [she was] entitled to
                    50% of [the] matrimonial assets”. Her insistence on
                    an equal division of the matrimonial assets in the e-mail
                    was deliberate and made on the basis of qualified legal
                    advice obtained regarding the division of matrimonial assets
                    under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Ms Ragupathy relied on a
                    report prepared by Dr Bose, the Defendant’s
                        psychiatrist,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> to
                    prove that the Defendant was suffering from depression such
                    that she could not understand what she was signing when she
                    signed the Deed. In response, the Plaintiff produced a
                    report from Dr Brian Yeo to rebut Dr Bose’s
                    report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Dr Bose opined on the
                    mental state of the Defendant between January 2003 and
                    October 2003 and, in particular, on 28 March 2003 (the
                    day of the signing of the Deed) and concluded that the
                    Defendant was “unable to think clearly or rationally
                    in the face of these various factors that were affecting her
                    mental state in March 2003”. It is important to note
                    that Dr Bose did not specifically state that the Defendant
                    was so depressed that she did not know what she was
                    signing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     According to Dr
                    Bose’s report, the Defendant had her first
                    consultation with Dr Bose on 23 January 2003, and was
                    prescribed anti-depressants for her depression.
                    Subsequently, she spoke over the phone with Dr Bose on
                    7 March 2003. It was not until 19 August 2003,
                    more than 3 months after the Deed was signed that Dr Bose
                    saw the Defendant for a second consultation. It was only
                    then that the Defendant disclosed to Dr Bose the alleged
                    abuse committed against her by the Plaintiff. Subsequently,
                    the Defendant had consultations with Dr Bose on
                    12 September 2003, 6 October 2003 and
                    12 January 2004. Clearly, Dr Bose did not examine the
                    Defendant from 23 January 2003 to 19 August 2003,
                    apart from receiving a phone call from the Defendant on
                    7 March 2003. Dr Bose’s report on 9 March
                    2004 was almost a year after the Deed was
                signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In my view, Dr
                    Bose’s expert opinion is of limited evidential value
                    and weight as it is scarcely contemporaneous and was made on
                    the basis of consultations and observations made on dates
                    well after the Deed was signed. For completeness, I should
                    refer to Dr Brian Yeo’s expert report. Dr Yeo was
                    engaged by the Plaintiff for his opinion on Dr Bose’s
                    report on the mental state of the Defendant at the time she
                    executed the Deed. In Dr Yeo’s opinion, it would be
                    difficult for Dr Bose to express an opinion on the mental
                    state of the Defendant at the time she signed the Deed
                    without having examined the Defendant “at or near the
                    execution of the Separation Deed.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> As for the phone
                    call to Dr Bose on 7 March 2003, Dr Yeo opined that the
                    conversation Dr Bose had with the Defendant was inadequate
                    to reach a conclusion that she was not able to think
                    rationally or clearly in March 2003. Based on Dr
                    Bose’s narration of the first consultation with the
                    Defendant, the Defendant did not appear to Dr Yeo to be an
                    “individual that was unable to think clearly or
                        irrationally”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>
                    This is what Dr Yeo wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even at the first consultation in January 2003, Dr
                        Bose had acknowledged that Mdm Khoo had been guarded
                        with her conscious desire to protect her husband’s
                        name and status. She was able to give the history of her
                        problems to Dr Bose, including confidential information
                        regarding her affair, yet expressing her wish to Dr Bose
                        that she was seeking her husband’s forgiveness and
                        her hopes of attaining a reconciliation with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is in my view not of an individual that was
                        unable to think clearly or rationally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is also important to
                    understand the significance of the fact that the Defendant
                    went back to see Dr Bose only on 19 August 2003, months
                    after the first consultation and execution of the
                    Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Based on the evidence, it
                    seemed to me that the Defendant consulted Dr Bose again on
                    19 August 2003 after she realised that the Plaintiff
                    had started a serious relationship with Li Hongxia
                    (“Hongxia”) as his partner, and that it was
                    not on account of the alleged abuse inflicted by the
                    Plaintiff on the Defendant as she had claimed. The Defendant
                    was probably depressed because months after the Deed the
                    Plaintiff had moved on with his life and any sliver of hope
                    to reconcile was gone. It must be noted that the Defendant
                    did not appear to have informed Dr Bose of the
                    Plaintiff’s serious relationship with Hongxia; Dr
                    Bose’s report did not mention anything about
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In March 2003, the
                    Defendant was in all likelihood prepared to accept a
                    situation where the Plaintiff could have liaisons with other
                    women but not enter into a serious relationship. When the
                    parties separated in March 2003, the Plaintiff made it clear
                    to the Defendant that he might and would date other women.
                    In his e-mail to the Defendant dated 6 March
                        2003,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> the
                    Plaintiff told the Defendant that she must continue to be
                    faithful and loving to him while he may engage in casual
                    relationships with other women:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you must have clarity, you cannot date any man so
                        long as you are married to me, notwithstanding the
                        separation, nor show any interest in any man other than
                        me. You shall continue to be warm, wifely and loving to
                        me at all times without expecting anything from me other
                        than the financial assistance. On my part, I will
                        respond in accordance with firstly any assessment of
                        your sincerity and genuine desire to atone for your sin
                        and unfaithfulness, and secondly, of course, <em>my own development of feelings for other
                            women who may turn up in my life. I intend to have
                            girlfriends as I do need a lot of love, and you know

                        you and the boys. To the extent that you could share
                        some of that love if you continue to devote yourself
                        only to me, I will try my very best to make it

                    stated herself in her affidavit that the Plaintiff told his
                    friends and relatives that she had agreed to him having a
                    mistress and would go on dates with women from China before
                    informing her about the details of his dates. In another

                    dating several Chinese nationals in November 2002 and
                    already had a mistress by February or March

                    in his affidavit that he believed the Defendant found out
                    sometime in June 2003 that he had met Hongxia, and he sensed
                    a change in the Defendant’s attitude towards him
                        then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>

                    Plaintiff since sometime in the middle of 2003 and started
                    going steady with the Plaintiff in the later part of 2003.
                    All these were not rebutted or denied by the Defendant in
                    her affidavits; in fact, the Defendant has been silent about
                    Hongxia throughout all her affidavits and talked about an
                    unidentified “mistress” instead,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> except for one
                    notable instance where she averred that the Plaintiff had
                    digressed in his affidavit when he stated that she was
                    unable to accept Hongxia as his partner because it was
                    irrelevant to the proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I now come to the
                    Defendant’s allegation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> that she signed the Deed on
                    the Plaintiff’s false promise that he would reconcile
                    with her if she did so and she bore the hope then that the
                    Plaintiff would accept her back. I find it difficult to
                    believe that the Defendant was misled in the way she had
                    claimed. In the same e-mail dated 21 March 2003 that
                    the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff already referred to
                    above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>, the
                    Defendant herself acknowledged that the Plaintiff has been
                    seeing other women on a casual basis. By then, the Plaintiff
                    had announced that he could live without her and she was
                    devastated by his announcement. It was the Defendant who
                    expressed hope of getting back together in the future and
                    that she would happily tear up the Deed. The Defendant
                    wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dearest Wong,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wrote you a long letter explaining how I have loved
                        you and continue to still love you and it is not
                        necessary to repeat it here. Since this nightmare began,
                        my first priority has always been that we reconcile. You
                        know how happy I was when you told me just before
                        Chinese New Year that we could continue to love together
                        after Chinese New Year. <em>I think I
                            have continued to be a warm and loving wife to you

                            since the beginning of this year.</em>
                        Unfortunately, <em>when you returned from
                            Harbin and Shanghai, you decided that you would be
                            better off and could live without me</em>.
                        That completely devastated me such that I really needed
                        to take my medication to get through the days and the
                        nights and had to increase the dosage. I am still
                        dependent on medication now.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In my view, the Defendant
                    had overstated her claim of the Plaintiff’s promise of
                    reconciliation. The Deed contained two clauses which are
                    telling. First, the Deed contemplates a divorce between the
                    parties and obliges the Defendant to give her consent to a
                    divorce based on their separation when the time came (see
                    clause 8). Secondly, on the outside chance that the couple
                    should get back together, the Deed would become void if they
                    co-habited as man and wife for over a continuous period of
                    six months after the date of the Deed (see clause 9).
                    Furthermore, the Deed would be void save for accrued rights
                    under the Deed which remained enforceable against the
                    wrongdoer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I now come to the final
                    piece of evidence that militated against the vitiating
                    factors raised by the Defendant. The evidence showed that
                    the Defendant was able to fully function at work. As
                    disclosed in the Plaintiff’s affidavit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> the Defendant
                    held important appointments in her field as well as in other
                    areas she was involved in. At various times, the Defendant
                    was the Vice Dean of her Faculty, the President of the
                    Singapore Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,
                    and the Vice President for Academic Planning at the Asian
                    University for Women. To further buttress the point that the
                    Defendant had no difficulties functioning for the large part
                    of the year of 2003 during the time the Defendant was on
                    study leave to pursue a diploma in medical
                        education,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> the
                    Plaintiff adduced documentary evidence to show that the
                    Defendant received several grants for research projects,
                    worked on various projects and published numerous papers
                    during 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> She
                    also wrote an article regarding the improvement of the
                    medical graduate programme and supervision of postgraduate
                    students, which was published in June 2003 for the Centre
                    for Development of Teaching and Learning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> From these
                    examples, I agreed with Mr Khoo that it was hard to accept
                    the Defendant’s claim that she was completely broken
                    and was in a state of depression so as to diminish her
                    ability to think clearly and rationally to fully understand
                    what the Deed would entail during the months leading up to
                    the signing of the Deed. The evidence pointed to the
                    Defendant’s energy and capacity for mentally
                    challenging work during 2003. It is highly unlikely that she
                    was unable to appreciate the significance of the Deed when
                    she considered and signed it in March 2003. This view is
                    reinforced by Dr Yeo’s comments on the
                    Defendant’s ability to fully function at work in
                        2003:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Dr Bose’s affidavit, there was no mention to
                        account for Mdm Khoo’s ability to function at such
                        a high intellectual level while holding her opinion that
                        Mdm Khoo could not think rationally or clearly at that
                        period in March 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no mention of Mdm Khoo not being able to
                        function in her academic duties or in her ability to
                        continue in her post-graduate course work during this
                        period. I note that since then, Mdm Khoo had received a
                        teaching award and had taken up higher academic posts
                        both locally and abroad.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is obvious that Mdm Khoo is blessed with high
                        intelligence and is an individual that had identified
                        and had taken on may leadership roles in
                        academia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus, unless there are corroborating evidence to show
                        that Mdm Khoo was not able to function at work due to
                        her stress and mental state in March 2003, I am of the
                        opinion that her innate superior intellectual capacity
                        would make it very difficult to conclude, especially
                        without examining her then, that Mdm Khoo was not able
                        to think clearly or rationally and thus not understand
                        what she was signing in March 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the light of all the
                    above, I was unable to accept Ms Ragupathy’s
                    contention that the Defendant was coerced, abused and/or
                    threatened into signing the Deed or did not understand the
                    consequences and risks of signing the Deed. I concluded that
                    the Deed was not tainted by any of the vitiating factors
                    suggested by Ms Ragupathy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Ms Ragupathy’s
                    fallback argument is that if the Deed was valid, it was
                    repudiated or terminated by reason of the alleged breaches
                    of its terms by the Plaintiff. I agreed with Mr Khoo that
                    there were no clear statements in the Defendant’s
                    affidavits alluding to the termination of the Deed or that
                    she had accepted the Plaintiff’s repudiatory breach.
                    In fact, the premise of her affidavits was of a subsisting
                    agreement and her focus was on setting it aside because of
                    vitiating factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For the reasons set out
                    above, I dismissed SUM 1553/2011. I reserved the issue of
                    costs for SUM 1553/2011 until after the ancillary matters
                    are decided by me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I wish to point out that
                    even though the Deed was not set aside, the Deed would have
                    to be scrutinised in order to determine the weight to be
                    given to it in deciding the ancillary matters.
                    Section 112(1) of the Charter gives the court the power
                    to order a division of matrimonial assets “in such
                    proportions as the court thinks just and equitable”.
                    Matrimonial agreements do not and cannot oust the
                    court’s jurisdiction to order a just and equitable
                    division of matrimonial assets. An agreement between parties
                    to a marriage relating to the division of matrimonial assets
                    like the Deed cannot automatically be enforced in and of
                    itself and is only one of the factors listed under section
                    112(2) of the Charter to be considered by the court in
                    determining a just and equitable division of the matrimonial
                    assets, and the weight to be accorded to such an agreement
                    depends on the precise facts and circumstances of the case
                    itself: see <em>TQ v TR</em> at
                    [73]-[75], [77], [80], [103]; <em>AOO v
                        AON</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1169 at [19]; <em>AFS v AFU</em> [2011] 3 SLR 275 at [17]-[18]. As the court noted
                    in <em>TQ v TR</em> (at [80], [86]),
                    such an agreement may be given conclusive weight and
                    effectively enforced in its entirety if the facts and
                    circumstances warranted so. Similar sentiments have been
                    expressed by Chao Hick Tin JA in a recent decision of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>AQS v AQR</em>
                    [2012] SGCA 3. Chao JA reiterated (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any case, an agreement between the parties made in
                        contemplation of divorce could not be decisive. It is
                        only one of the factors listed in s112(2) of the
                        Women’s Charter that the court must take into
                        account as part of its overarching duty to reach a just
                        and equitable division in light of all the circumstances
                        of the case. This Court affirmed in <em>TQ v TR and another appeal</em> [2009] 2
                        SLR(R) 961 at [75] that even though post-nuptial
                        agreements could be accorded more weight than
                        pre-nuptial agreements, how much weight was to be
                        allocated to a postnuptial must ultimately depend on the
                        precise circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As for the circumstances
                    to be taken into consideration in the determination of the
                    weight to be given to a matrimonial agreement, the oft-cited
                    dictum of Ormrod LJ in <em>Edgar v
                        Edgar</em> [1980] 1 WLR 1410 is relevant and
                    provides valuable guidance (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Granatino v
                        Radmacher</em> [2011] 1 AC 534 at [38]; <em>MacLeod v MacLeod</em> [2010] 1 AC 298 at
                        [25], [42]; <em>NA v MA</em> [2007] 1 FLR 1760 at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>; <em>A v B
                        (Financial Relief: Agreements)</em> [2005] 2
                    F.L.R. 730 at [13];
                        <em>X v X (Y and Z
                        Intervening)</em> [2002] 1 F.L.R. 508 at [84];
                        <em>Benson v Benson (Deceased)</em>
                    [1996] 1 F.L.R. 692 at 704G-705B). Ormrod LJ said (at
                    1417):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To decide what weight should be given, in order to
                        reach a just result, to a prior agreement not to claim a
                        lump sum, regard must be had to the conduct of both
                        parties, leading up to the prior agreement, and to their
                        subsequent conduct, in consequence of it. It is not
                        necessary in this connection to think in formal legal
                        terms, such as misrepresentation or
                            estoppel; <em>all</em> the circumstances as they affect
                        each of two human beings must be considered in the
                        complex relationship of marriage. So, the circumstances
                        surrounding the making of the agreement are relevant.
                        Under pressure by one side, exploitation of a dominant
                        position to secure an unreasonable advantage, inadequate
                        knowledge, possibly bad legal advice, an important
                        change of circumstances, unforeseen or overlooked at the
                        time of making the agreement, are all relevant to the
                        question of justice between the parties. Important too
                        is the general proposition that formal agreements,
                        properly and fairly arrived at with competent legal
                        advice, should not be displaced unless there are good
                        and substantial grounds for concluding that an injustice
                        will be done by holding the parties to the terms of
                        their agreement. There may well be other considerations
                        which affect the justice of this case; the above list is
                        not intended to be an exclusive catalogue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Essentially, where the
                    marital agreement is valid and subsisting, the court will
                    look at the facts and circumstances that are likely to
                    reduce or eliminate the weight to be attached to the marital
                    agreement. I have in mind, unconscionable conduct as such
                    undue pressure (falling short of duress). Another example is
                    unworthy conduct such as exploitation of a dominant position
                    to secure an unfair advantage. An important change of
                    circumstances, unforeseen or overlooked at the time of
                    entering into the marital agreement may be
                relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The appropriate weight to
                    be given to the Deed is yet to be argued and determined and
                    this will take place at the adjourned hearing of the
                    ancillary matters.</p>
