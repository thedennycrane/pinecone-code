class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 Civil Appeal No 45 of 2016 (“CA 45”) and Civil Appeal No 52 of 2016 (“CA 52”) are, respectively, an appeal (by the plaintiff) and a cross-appeal (by the defendant) against the decision of the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in Suit No 695 of 2012 (see <span class="font-italic">Quek</span><span class="font-italic"> Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1106 (“the GD”)). The Judge awarded the plaintiff, Quek Yen Fei Kenneth (“Quek”), damages of $452,509.41 in respect of a motor accident for which the defendant, Yeo Chye Huat (“Yeo”), had been found to be 100% liable. The Judge also awarded Quek costs on a standard basis for the trial on liability up until the date of an offer to settle (“OTS”) made by Yeo on 15 February 2016, and ordered that each party bear his own costs for the assessment of damages hearing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Quek was born on 17 November 1991, and is 25 years old today. He stopped his studies in March 2007 at 15 years of age, dropping out three months into his repeat year for the Secondary Three Normal (Technical) course. He enlisted for National Service on 4 March 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 11 August 2011, when Quek was still in National Service, he was riding his motorcycle when a taxi driven by Yeo collided into him (the “Accident”). His right foot was severely mangled and his right leg had to be amputated below the knee. His right collarbone was also fractured. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Quek brought an action in negligence against Yeo. This action was heard by the Judge, who gave judgment in Quek’s favour with damages to be assessed on the basis of 100% liability on the part of Yeo. The reasons for the Judge’s decision on liability are set out in <span class="font-italic">Quek</span><span class="font-italic"> Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat</span> [2013] SGHC 132. Yeo’s appeal on liability to the Court of Appeal was subsequently withdrawn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The assessment of damages took place also before the Judge, who gave his decision on 3 March 2016. With the consent of the parties, this decision was subsequently revised at a hearing in chambers before the Judge on 27 April 2016 to reflect the updated prices of an item of future medical expenses (“FME”). Interest and costs were also assessed at this hearing. In the interim, however, both Quek and Yeo filed notices of appeal against the 3 March 2016 decision on the assessment of damages (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before the Judge finalised his awards for FME, interest, and costs).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 It was agreed before the Judge, and neither party is now disputing, that the two notices of appeal cover all issues in the proceedings, including the orders made at the chambers hearing on 27 April 2016. Further, neither party is taking issue with the fact that the respective notices of appeal were filed before that chambers hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Yeo made two OTSes before the assessment of damages hearing on 16 February 2016, neither of which was accepted by Quek: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) on 28 January 2016, Yeo made a first OTS for $480,000.00, which remained open for 14 days (until 11 February 2016); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) on 15 February 2016, Yeo made a second OTS for $550,000.00, which remained open for 14 days (until 29 February 2016) and included a clause that specifically withdrew the first OTS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Before us, the parties proceeded on the basis that Quek’s claims for FME, loss of future earnings (“LFE”), and loss of earning capacity (“LEC”), relate only to the period on and after 3 March 2016, which was the date the Judge gave his decision on the assessment of damages. At that time, Quek was 24 years old. Accordingly, we assessed FME, LFE, and LEC only for the period on and after 3 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Judge awarded

class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On the issue of costs, the Judge also ordered Yeo to pay Quek the costs of the trial on liability up until 15 February 2016 (the date of the second OTS) on a

The <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“Guidelines”) provide a range of $40,000.00 to $70,000.00 for the pain and suffering from a below-knee amputation of one leg. The Judge gave Quek a slight uplift of $10,000.00 for the pain and suffering from his losing of a leg at the relatively young age of 20 years, his undergoing surgery to attempt to salvage the leg, and his continued experiencing of phantom limb pain and pain from a neuroma at the amputation stump even four years after the Accident (see the GD at [14]–[16]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">FME</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplier</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Judge applied a multiplier of 18 years for FME, based on Quek’s age of 24 years at the date of the trial. He did not grant the 24-year multiplier sought by Quek because it was speculative to determine the extent to which medical advancements would increase the life expectancy of the average male during Quek’s lifetime so as to justify a 24-year multiplier (see the GD at [30]–[32]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplicand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Judge found that prostheses ranging from levels K0 to K4 exist and are designed to support increasing intensities of activity. A K4 prosthesis was equipped with a running blade and facilitated a level of ambulation that allowed for the high impact activities (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, sprinting) typical of an athlete. A K3 prosthesis supported a lower intensity of activity that fulfilled the demands of a typical community ambulator (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, light jogging and running for the bus) and allowed a user to traverse most environmental barriers as well as engage in exercise. A K2 prosthesis, by contrast, did not admit of such activities, and enabled only such low intensity activities as traversing curbs, stairs, and uneven surfaces (see the GD at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Judge found Quek to be an active young man, whose day-to-day needs included light jogging and running for the bus. He thus awarded Quek a lump sum for the costs of the use and replacement of a K3 prosthesis equivalent to the receipt of $3,585.30 per annum (comprising $3,493.30 for the K3 prosthesis itself and $92.00 for the medical consultations needed to fit that prosthesis) for the remainder of Quek’s life. Even if the intensity of Quek’s activities would likely decline with age, it would, in the Judge’s view, be unduly onerous for Quek to suddenly have to adapt to the restricted range of activities allowed by a K2 prosthesis having spent the majority of his life with a K3 prosthesis (see the GD at [39], [42] and [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge did not award Quek the costs of the use and replacement of a K4 prosthesis. Although Quek had participated in sprinting trials, sprinting was merely a temporary recreational interest of his. Further, awarding Quek the costs of a K4 prosthesis on top of the costs of a K3 prosthesis would overcompensate him. Nevertheless, the Judge awarded Quek the costs of the single K4 prosthesis ($7.276.00) that Quek had purchased after the Accident to explore his options while adjusting to his post-amputation situation (see the GD at [40] and [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Judge awarded Quek the costs of the use of an aqua limb, at a rate of $710.00 per annum. Unlike a regular K3 prosthesis, an aqua limb was waterproof. It would therefore allow Quek to shower standing up, instead of sitting or standing on only one leg. Quek would therefore be able to use bathrooms that had not been modified to suit his needs and engage in activities on the beach, where contact with water was inevitable (see the GD at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Judge awarded Quek provisional damages of $5,000.00 for the surgical excision of his neuroma and $11,000.00 for the surgical treatment of his right collarbone – payable only if Quek were to undergo the surgeries and tender the bill within three years. Quek’s orthopaedic experts had testified that both the neuroma and the right collarbone injury could be left untreated, but that the ultimate decision of whether to undergo surgery should be left to Quek, if the pain caused by the neuroma hindered the normal functioning of his limb and affected his quality of life (see the GD at [65] and [66]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">LFE/LEC</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplier</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Judge applied a multiplier of 18 years to Quek’s claims for both LFE and LEC.

Quek had dropped out of school in Secondary Three and had a sketchy employment history ever since. The only clear (and available) evidence was that he had served National Service and had a keen interest in motorcycles. His career path was uncertain. It was thus impossible to make an appropriate estimate of the income Quek would have earned but for the Accident. Yet, it was also inappropriate to peg Quek’s future earnings to the career model of the civil service. Quek had been unable to secure a stable full-time job and shuttled between part-time jobs. He was also unable to show any particular aptitude or interest in any trade (see the GD at [83] and [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Judge, in fact, found Quek’s employment and remuneration history to be as follows (see the GD at [86]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From early-2008, Quek worked at TC Homeplus Pte Ltd (“TC Homeplus”) as a sales promoter of bed linen. However, he was dismissed due to his tardiness in reporting for work. Although Quek claimed to have earned a monthly income of $1,200.00 to $1,400.00 at TC Homeplus, he could not produce the relevant CPF income documents to support his claim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) After his dismissal by TC Homeplus up until September 2010, Quek worked at Craftmark (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Craftmark”), also as a sales promoter.

However, he was unable to provide an estimate of his earnings from this job as they had been paid to him in cash.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Judge rejected Quek’s evidence that he could have, like his father, earned $3,000.00 to $5,000.00 per month as a tipper-truck driver. Quek had not called his father as a witness, and this evidence was therefore hearsay. In any event, Quek had not shown any inclination for such work at all (see the GD at [82]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) LEC</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Judge awarded Quek $162,000.00 for LEC, based on a multiplicand of $750.00 per month over an 18-year multiplier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Judge found that the injuries caused by the Accident had reduced Quek’s earning capacity. Quek was unable to stand or walk for long hours, and could no longer carry loads of more than 20kg. Even if he were to be employed, he was likely to receive a lower income than an able-bodied person doing the same job (see the GD at [89]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Judge noted, however, that Quek had previously fractured both his wrists in a prior unrelated accident fewer than two months before the Accident (with Yeo). This injury, which was unrelated to Yeo’s negligence, had already diminished Quek’s ability to perform manual tasks such as lifting and therefore his earning capacity. The LEC multiplicand of $750.00 per month compensated Quek for the further disadvantage caused by the Accident to his subsequent employability and income (see the GD at [90] and [91]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Quek’s Case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">FME</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Quek seeks a multiplier of 25 years for FME “based on a conservative estimate of [Quek’s] expected life span of 74 years”.

He argues that he had a remaining working life of at least 43 years as at the time of the assessment of damages, when he was 24 years of age, because the retirement age will soon be raised from 65 to 67 years. Indeed, given his low level of education, he argues that he would likely have worked past 67 years. He submits that where a claimant has a remaining working life of 35 years or more, an LFE multiplier of just under half of the remaining working life is applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Quek distinguishes <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Kiat </span>(see above at [20]) because it involved a 28-year-old claimant, and there were no reasons or authority given for the finding that an 18-year multiplier represented the “current trend”.

He argues that a claim for LFE may be sustained even if his particular career path cannot be determined, and may be derived from the median salary of persons of equivalent education set out in the Ministry of Manpower tables on median gross monthly income from full-time employment (“the MoM Tables”). Pursuant to those tables, a 24-year-old man with Quek’s educational qualifications would earn an average of $2,978.22 per month across his remaining working life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Quek disputes the Judge’s finding that he had flitted from job to job. He contends that he had been a sales promoter for four years before he enlisted into National Service. Only after the Accident was he unable to keep a stable job. In addition, he earned $1,400.00 working at TC Homeplus at the age of 16 years – an 83% increase from the average sum of $761.00 earned by 15 to 19 year olds, according to the MoM Tables. He argues that in deriving his multiplicand for LFE, an uplift of at least 50% should be applied to the average median lifetime salary of $2,978.22 per month, to give a gross monthly income figure of $4,467.33 per month. This was within the range of his likely earnings but for the Accident, had he become a tipper-truck driver like his father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Quek seeks at least $100,000.00 for LEC in addition to an award of LFE. In the event that no award of LFE is made, he contends that the LEC multiplicand should be more than $750 per month because his prior wrist injury, on account of which the Judge reduced the LEC multiplicand to $750 per month, retarded the range of motion of his wrist only insignificantly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Yeo’s Case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pain and suffering</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Yeo argues that the award of $80,000.00 for pain and suffering from the below-knee amputation should be reduced. The Judge, he argues, placed excessive weight on the phantom limb pain experienced by Quek and the unsuccessful surgical attempt to salvage his leg. Phantom limb pain is common after amputations, is already noted in the awards for amputations, and should not be factored in again “to make an increased award”. Further, the pain and suffering experienced by Quek was less “severe” than that in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Pang Teck Kong v Chew </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hwa</span> [1992] SGHC 31 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Teck Kong</span>”), where Warren Khoo J awarded only $50,000.00 to a 22-year-old claimant whose right leg was amputated below the knee after it was run over <span class="font-italic">twice</span> by a lorry; the second time when the driver of the lorry reversed the lorry over him when he was on the ground.

Quek is a smoker and was 24 years old at the date of the trial. A multiplier of 18 years is thus fair and appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">LFE/LEC</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplier</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Yeo submits that the retirement age is usually adhered to for workers like Quek, who would have engaged in physical work.

The objective evidence in the form of Quek’s income statements fails to corroborate his account of his pre-Accident remuneration. Further, Quek with his K3 prosthesis can perform his pre-Accident vocation of a sales promoter, save that he can no longer lift weights over 20kg. Quek has been able to secure employment with Unique Motorsports Pte Ltd (“Unique Motorsports”) at a salary of between $1,400.00 and $1,450.00 per month, save that he “left Unique Motorsports not because he was not able to perform the job but because he was late for work consistently even though he was required to report for work only at 10.00 a.m”. The real reason keeping Quek out of work is his attitude and not his disability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Yeo adds that Quek can now earn an income higher than his pre-Accident income, and has suffered no loss to justify a claim for LFE. In any event, he never intended to study further after dropping out of school in Secondary Three. His highest educational qualification is thus that of a lower secondary education. At best, he would have achieved only the median gross monthly income of a worker with lower secondary qualification, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $2,100.00 per month based on the MoM Tables. With future increments and bonuses, Quek’s current earning capacity of between $1,400.00 and $1,450.00 per month (excluding employer’s CPF) could well exceed this sum of $2,100.00 per month (which includes employer’s CPF). Accordingly, there is no loss of income to justify LFE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Yeo argues that the award of LEC to Quek should be reduced to $500.00 per month, or approximately $110,000.00 over the 18-year multiplier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Yeo argues that Quek’s pre-Accident earning capacity of less than $1,000.00 per month is much lower than his post-Accident earning capacity of $1,400.00 per month with Unique Motorsports. With the K3 prosthesis, Quek can work in the same capacity as he did before the Accident, save that he can no longer carry objects that weigh over 20kg. Moreover, Quek now owns two motorcycles and has been able to ride them safely with his prosthetic leg. However, he “chose not to work for reasons only known to him”. There was thus no loss of earning capacity attributable to the Accident. Nevertheless, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Kiat</span>, he accepts that $500.00 per month may be awarded to Quek for LEC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pain and suffering</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We agree with the reasons given by the Judge for the $10,000.00 uplift from the upper limit of the $40,000.00 to $70,000.00 range in the Guidelines for the pain and suffering from a below-knee amputation (above at [13]).

The <span class="font-italic">multiplicand</span> represents the quantum of loss, whether in terms of an incurrence of medical expenses (for FME) or a reduction of earnings (for LFE/LEC), that the claimant is expected to suffer at periodic intervals in the future. The <span class="font-italic">multiplier</span>, in turn, is the mathematical tool used to calculate the lump-sum present value of the stream of future periodic losses across the remaining life expectancy and the remaining working life (collectively, “period of future loss”) of the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Three factual premises undergird the multiplier (see <span class="font-italic">Kemp &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Kemp: The Quantum of Damages </span>(William Norris QC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 2009, Release 137 (October 2015)) (“<span class="font-italic">Kemp </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Kemp</span>”) at paras 10-009.1–10-009.2):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, the length of the expected period of future loss, from the date of the assessment of damages to the date of either death (for a lifetime multiplier) or retirement (for an earnings multiplier);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, the receipt of compensation for the future losses by the claimant as an immediate lump sum, which can almost invariably be invested at a rate over and above that of inflation to make a profit, and the probability that mortality risks (and other vicissitudes of life) would curtail his expected period of future loss; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, the continual drawing-down and spending of the invested lump sum, such that by the end of the expected period of future loss the claimant will have nothing left. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In effect, the court awards the claimant a lump sum in damages that represents the present value of an <span class="font-italic">annuity</span> offering a <span class="font-italic">rate of return </span><span class="font-italic">(net of contingencies) </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the discount rate) <span class="font-italic">that </span><span class="font-italic">the claimant is assumed to be able to achieve by investing the lump-sum award</span>. This annuity will pay the claimant the amount of the multiplicand at each periodic interval over the expected period of future loss, and at the conclusion of which the annuity terminates (see the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Mallett</span><span class="font-italic"> v McMonagle, a minor by Hugh Joseph McMonagle, his father and guardian ad litem, and Another</span> [1970] AC 166 (“<span class="font-italic">Mallett</span><span class="font-italic"> v McMonagle</span>”) at 175).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Admittedly, it is never an easy task to assess the expected period of future loss in order to determine a multiplier, whether for FME or for LFE/LEC.

At that time, as was the practice in the UK, the courts in Singapore adopted a “rough and ready” approach to the assessment of multipliers (see <span class="font-italic">Kemp</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Kemp</span> at para 10-009.3). The primary concern was ensuring consistency with the multipliers awarded to claimants of a similar age in previous cases, although adjustments were occasionally made on account of uncertainties unique to the claimants in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd</span> [1983–1984] SLR(R) 388 (“<span class="font-italic">Lai Wee Lian</span>”), the Privy Council (in an appeal from this court) observed at [20] that the starting point for calculating a multiplier was the period of time in the future that the claimant “can be expected to live but, in consequence of the accident, not to earn”. This figure was then discounted to reflect, first, the inevitable contingencies and uncertainties of human life and working capacity, and second, the fact that the award of damages would be paid as a lump sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Board noted that the practice in England was to apply this discounted figure as a direct multiplier, whereas a common practice in Singapore at that time was to calculate the relevant damages by reference to a set of present value (or financial) tables that had been prepared by M/s Murphy and Dunbar, Solicitors (“the M&amp;D Tables”). These tables were “calculated upon the assumption that the capital sum (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sum awarded as damages) will be invested and will earn interest at 5% per annum” (see <span class="font-italic">Lai Wee Lian</span> at [20]–[21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Board observed that it was not improper to use the M&amp;D Tables in assessing damages, and that the M&amp;D Tables “enable the loss to be calculated more accurately than is possible by the direct application of a multiplier”. However, it cautioned against erroneous double-discounting: reducing the award for contingencies and accelerated receipt <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">addition to</span> the discounting implicit in an application of a discounted figure as a direct multiplier (as was the practice in England). The Board concluded that “if confusion is to be avoided, it seems desirable that a uniform practice should be followed by all courts” (see <span class="font-italic">Lai Wee Lian </span>at [25]–[27]). It then discounted the expected remaining working years of the claimant there “in respect both of future contingencies and advance payment”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an application of a direct multiplier without reference to the M&amp;D Tables (see <span class="font-italic">Lai Wee Lian</span> at [29]).

The multipliers in those tables were calculated on the basis that a lump-sum award would be invested at a rate of return of 2.5% per annum net of tax, and in light of the expected mortality rates of the average British person (but not risks other than mortality, although the tables offered a methodology to reduce the multiplier on account of such other contingencies) (see <span class="font-italic">Actuarial Tables with explanatory notes for use in Personal Injury and Fatal Accident Cases</span> (7th Ed, 2011) (“the Ogden Tables 2011”) at Section A paras 4–9).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, applying a fixed formula, as was done in Malaysia pursuant to s 28A of the Civil Law Act 1956 (Act 67) (Malaysia).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This court observed in <span class="font-italic">Hafizul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that, absent authoritative actuarial tables like the Ogden Tables 2011 in Singapore, both the Precedent Approach and the Arithmetic Approach were relevant when calculating a multiplier.

These figures would be determined predominantly (but not exclusively) by reference, respectively, to the statutory retirement age and average life expectancy in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Hafizul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60] and [76]). We pause here to note that in this regard, the M&amp;D Tables are not actuarial tables but present value (or financial) tables, which take account of only accelerated receipt but not mortality risks (see Wai-Sum Chan and Felix W H Chan, “<span class="font-italic">Lai Wee Lian</span> Revisited – Should Actuarial Tables be Used for the Assessment of Damages in Personal Injury Litigation in Singapore?: <span class="font-italic">Wells v Wells</span>” [2000] Sing JLS 364 at 370).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In <span class="font-italic">Lai Wai </span><span class="font-italic">Keong Eugene v Loo Wei Yen </span>[2014] 3 SLR 702 (“<span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span>”) at [20]–[22], this court rejected a submission that <span class="font-italic">Hafizul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>essentially<span class="font-italic"> </span>endorsed dispensing with the Precedent Approach in favour of the Arithmetic Approach, and emphasised that neither approach could invariably be preferred over the other.

In other words, “in determining the various discounts to be applied under the [Arithmetic] [A]pproach, <span class="font-italic">a court should not stray too far from the implicit discounts embedded in the multipliers used in comparable cases</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span> at [20] and [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This court acknowledged that the multipliers awarded in Singapore had traditionally been based on the assumption that the lump-sum award could be invested to achieve real rates of return of between 4% and 5% per annum, and that the prevailing rates of return on fixed deposits were below 4% per annum and had remained so for 15 years. Nevertheless, this court held that it was not for it to effect a radical and sweeping revision of the discount rate for accelerated receipt, even if a court could adopt a lower or higher discount rate where appropriate on the facts of a particular case (see <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span> at [28] and [32]–[38]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was not reasonable for a claimant to invest his entire lump-sum award in fixed deposits, particularly where the award was meant to provide for a long period of future loss. A large portion of the award would not be called upon for many years, and that portion could be invested in equities or other asset classes to achieve a higher return (as compared to fixed deposits) meanwhile.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there was no guarantee that the prevailing low rates of return would persist. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, although there was scope for reform in the law on multiplier awards for personal injury, the courts were not in a position to undertake that reform. Any drastic change to the discount rate for accelerated receipt could only be undertaken after a careful study, with input from experts and the various stakeholders involved. This was a matter that fell within the institutional competence of the Legislature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For completeness, there remains an option for a court to order provisional damages in lieu of an award of general damages, pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). Such an order would allow the court more time to assess more accurately a loss that the claimant may potentially suffer in the future. This was done by this court in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling (by her next friend, Chua Wee Bee) </span>[2011] 3 SLR 610 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Ai Ling</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 There are two primary reasons why a stream of future losses is to be discounted on account of its immediate payment as a lump-sum award of damages, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>: (a) accelerated receipt; and (b) contingencies including mortality and the effect of other personal and structural considerations on the remaining life expectancy (for lifelong FME) and remaining working life (for LFE/LEC). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 We agree with and endorse the observations in <span class="font-italic">Hafizul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see above at [51]) on the methodology by which account may be taken of contingencies such as mortality and other vicissitudes of life in the calculation of a multiplier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We also agree with the observations in <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai </span>(see above at [55]) that radical and sweeping revisions of the discount rate on account of accelerated receipt lie within the province of Parliament and not the courts. Nevertheless, nothing precludes a court from adopting a lower or higher discount rate where this is appropriate <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the facts of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a particular case</span>. Where a case is not truly comparable to the precedents, or where there is other good reason to depart from them, including the matter of expert or actuarial evidence which we touch on at [62] below, the court can and should depart from past multiplier awards and the discount rates implicit in them. Indeed, as this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Hafizul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a blind adherence to the multipliers in previous cases is not desirable. The court should consider in each case whether the previous cases are truly comparable, and should not hesitate to depart from the multipliers used in previous cases if the circumstances call for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 More specifically, in applying the Precedent Approach, we would caution against not only blind adherence to the multipliers awarded in previous cases, but also against blind adherence to the <span class="font-italic">ratios</span> (or, conversely, the discount amounts) between the multipliers and the expected period of future loss (as Quek urges us to do in the context of LFE/LEC (see above at [29])). Just as the Precedent Approach provides as a useful cross-check of a multiplier derived under the Arithmetic Approach (see above at [54]), the Arithmetic Approach can <span class="font-italic">equally </span>be a useful cross-check of a multiplier derived under the Precedent Approach. But more than simply applying a pure arithmetical discount to the expected period of future loss on account of accelerated receipt and other contingencies, there is merit in using the arithmetical tool of the annualised discount <span class="font-italic">rate</span> in determining a multiplier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As an annualised figure, the discount rate allows for more meaningful and accurate comparisons between the awards of multipliers in different cases. It is also of immediate relevance to the rates of return on investments, and, accordingly, the effect of accelerated receipt. Finally, the effect of contingencies can be reflected through direct arithmetical adjustment of the discount rate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The difficulties in the calculation of discount rates may be mitigated through the use of financial, and, in particular, actuarial tables as a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proxy</span> for having to calculate direct discount rates (net of contingencies). Accordingly, we echo the observations that we made recently in the context of dependency claims that it would be helpful for parties, in addition to canvassing the multipliers set out in the precedents, to assist the court <span class="font-italic">further</span> by providing relevant financial or actuarial data to justify the discounts which they seek. This would facilitate the principled yet pragmatic development of the law, while ensuring consistency with past cases involving similarly-situated claimants (see <span class="font-italic">Zhu </span><span class="font-italic">Xiu Chun (alias Myint Myint Kyi) v Rockwills Trustee Ltd (administrators of the estate of and on behalf of the dependants of Heng Ang Tee Franklin, deceased) and other appeals</span> [2016] 5 SLR 412 (“<span class="font-italic">Rockwills</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees</span>”) at [85]–[86]). In fact, the use of such financial or actuarial tables in the assessment of damages for personal injuries is not foreign to Singapore. As early as in the 1980s, legal practitioners were relying on the M&amp;D Tables, and in 1993, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Eddie </span><span class="font-italic">Toon </span>expressly suggested<span class="font-italic"> </span>that reliance could be placed on actuarial tables (see above at [48]–[49]). In consequence, there remains little room for the formulaic or mechanistic approaches of the past in calculating a multiplier. Such approaches include the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) approximately halving the expected period of future loss (as was observed by the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">AOD (a minor suing by his </span><span class="font-italic">litigation representative) v AOE </span>[2016] 1 SLR 217 (“<span class="font-italic">AOD</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) applying a principle that “that the multiplier for future medical treatment was usually two years longer than the multiplier for loss of future earnings [or LEC]” (as was contended by counsel for the plaintiff (but which was rejected) in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Yiu v Lim Peng Seng</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 675 at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In our view, reason and logic suggest that the longer the expected period of future loss, the greater the discount <span class="font-italic">amount</span> should be. This reflects the increased <span class="font-italic">compounding</span> of the effect of accelerated receipt, inflation, contingencies, and other vicissitudes of life where the period of future loss is longer (see <span class="font-italic">Rockwills</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees </span>at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 We are also of the view that there is merit in adopting higher discount <span class="font-italic">rates</span> in cases of longer expected periods of future loss, and that there is (correspondingly) nothing wrong in principle with having negative discount rates. The discount rate is the rate of return (net of contingencies) that the claimant is expected to realise on his investment of his lump-sum award across the period of future loss. A claimant who receives a lump-sum award in respect of a long expected period of future loss is well-placed to ride out the short-term volatility of higher-yield investments and to avail himself of increases in interest rates in the future. Conversely, a low or even zero discount rate may justifiably be adopted if the remaining working life or remaining life expectancy of the claimant is very short, such that there is less scope for investment in riskier assets or for drastic changes in the prevailing interest rates (see <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai </span>at [34] and [38]). This was, in fact, the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Sie and another v Ranjendran s/o G Selamuthu </span>[2012] SGHC 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Sie</span>”) at [37], and more clearly by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in <span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting v Chan Chi </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen (No 2) </span>[2013] 2 HKLRD 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting</span>”), where Bharwaney J formulated a tiered framework of discount rates that varied with the length of the expected period of future loss. Each tier reflected the investment choices of a different class of claimant-investors, as driven by its specific needs and goals. The discount rates adopted were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 2.5% per annum for periods of future loss exceeding 10 years;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 1.0% per annum for periods of future loss from 5 to 10 years; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) -0.5% per annum for periods of future loss of less than 5 years, on the authority of the decision of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Simon v </span><span class="font-italic">Helmot</span> [2012] Med LR 394 (in an appeal from Guernsey) because the rates of inflation exceeded the rates of return on investments suitable for claimant-investors with such short investment horizons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Nevertheless, any development of the law that involves departing from the traditional discount rates, which are based on rates of return of between 4 to 5% per annum, should be undertaken only <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">incrementally</span>, and by reference to or analogy with past cases. Even legislators and administrators with their institutional resources struggle to assess a fair rate of return that claimants should be expected to realise on their lump-sum awards, as witnessed in the recent call in the UK to <span class="font-italic">increase</span> the discount rate, which had been reduced to 2.5% per annum pursuant to s 1 of the Damages Act 1996 (c 48) (UK). There is thus a real risk that courts, in attempting to do justice to claimants by compensating for the low rates of return on fixed deposits at present, unwittingly produce injustice by over-compensating claimants at the expense of defendants and those who fund them (see <span class="font-italic">Damages Act 1996: The Discount Rate</span> (A Joint Consultation produced by the Ministry of Justice, the Scottish Government and the Department of Justice, Northern Ireland; Consultation Paper CP 3/2013, 2013) at p 3):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At present the discount rate is set by reference to the expected rates of return on certain types of safe investments. However, there is evidence that recipients of these lump sums do not invest in the cautious way that is envisaged by the guidelines. Instead, the initial evidence indicates, they seem to invest in mixed portfolios, including higher risk investments. This may be the result of a number of factors, but it might suggest that the current legal parameters for setting the rate may produce a rate that is too low. This would result in over-compensation for claimants and extra cost for defendants and those who fund them. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In this regard, we note that recently, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance held in <span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting</span> that a discount rate of 4.5% per annum was inappropriate given the economic indicators that suggested that the exceptionally low interest rate regime would likely persist. This figure of 4.5% per annum was based on the assumed rate of return set out by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Cookson (Widow and </span><span class="font-italic">Administratrix of the Estate of Frank Cookson, decd) v Knowles</span> [1979] 1 AC 556 (“<span class="font-italic">Cookson v Knowles</span>”).

But when interest rates can go no lower, a central bank’s only option is to pump money into the economy directly.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The way the central bank does this is by buying assets — usually financial assets such as government and corporate bonds — using money it has simply created out of thin air.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The third round of quantitative easing was announced by the US Federal Reserve Bank on 13 September 2012 and is likely to put pressure on the UK to follow suit.

The Renminbi has been rising against the HK dollar for the past ten years. Strong internal demand within Mainland China has caused an increase in the price of food and other products in China. A significant amount of food is imported to Hong Kong from China daily. The rise of the Renminbi against the HK dollar has had a marked impact on consumer price inflation in Hong Kong recently. The peg is here to stay for a long, long time and the double whammy effect will continue in Hong Kong.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16.  The Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and its potential impact on the Hong Kong economy is explained in an extract from the 2011 Economic Background and 2012 Prospects, published in February 2012 by the Financial Secretary’s Office: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Eurozone debt crisis, which broke out in early 2010 upon mounting concern over the fiscal sustainability of several peripheral Eurozone economies, has re-intensified distinctly since the second quarter of 2011 and emerged as the biggest threat to the global economy and financial market stability. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Being a small and highly externally-oriented economy, the Hong Kong economy will inevitably be affected by the vicissitudes on the external front through both the trade and financial channels.

His FME award should therefore be pegged to his remaining life expectancy: the number of years that he is expected to live, going forward. Absent evidence that his lifespan differs from that of the national average male, his remaining life expectancy is calculated by subtracting his age from the average male life expectancy in Singapore at the time of the assessment of damages (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Tong</span> [2012] 2 SLR 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span>”) at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the existing precedents, 75 years is typically taken as the life expectancy of a male claimant in Singapore (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span> and the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ng Song </span><span class="font-italic">Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd and Another</span> [1997] SGHC 289 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Song Leng</span>”)). Nevertheless, counsel for Quek accepts (correctly, in our view) that it is appropriate to use a “conservative estimate” of 74 years as Quek’s expected life span (see above at [28]). Hence, we find that Quek’s remaining life expectancy, with reference to which the multiplier for FME will be calculated, is 50 years. This is the difference between Quek’s expected life span of 74 years and his age of 24 years at time of the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 We do not accept a submission made by counsel for Yeo that Quek’s smoking of 10 cigarettes a day reduced his remaining life expectancy.

At the 5.44% discount rate implicit in the Judge’s award, every $1 of annual multiplicand awarded to Quek has a present value of (a) $1.0000 at the time of the assessment of damages (when Quek is 24 years of age); (b) $0.9484 one year later (when Quek is 25 years of age); (c) between $0.0744 and $0.9484 each year thereafter; and (d) $0.0744 in the last year of Quek’s remaining life expectancy (when Quek is 74 years of age). Summing this stream of receipts will give a present value equivalent to 18 times of every $1 of annual multiplicand awarded to Quek.

Or 33 years at interest rates of 5 per cent. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Mallett v McMonagle</span> was followed in the context of a multiplier for personal injuries in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Cookson v Knowles</span> at 577 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Fraser of Tullybelton (this last mentioned case was departed from by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Knauer</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ministry of Justice </span>[2016] 2 WLR 672, but not on this particular point). And the observations of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Cookson </span><span class="font-italic">v Knowles </span>have been followed by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in <span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting </span>and this court in <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 We recognise that there is more than one way of calculating a discount rate, depending particularly on the frequency with which an annual interest rate is compounded. We acknowledge, too, the observations in <span class="font-italic">Paul v Rendell </span>at 579–580 that it may be unfruitful and even unhelpful “[t]o undertake detailed mathematical calculations in which nearly every factor is so speculative or unreliable in order to assess the capital sum to represent what is only one of several components in a total award of compensation”. Our purpose for calculating the discount rate here is not to prescribe an exclusive methodology for doing so in personal injuries cases. Rather, what we seek to do is to establish a more principled basis for comparing between the multipliers awarded in previous cases than simply looking at the discount amounts awarded there. In any event, as long as a single methodology is applied consistently, the differences in the results produced under different calculations are unlikely to be significant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Amongst the precedents referred to by the parties, we find <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span> and <span class="font-italic">TV Media</span> to be most relevant. The 53-year and 51-year remaining life expectancies in the respective cases are most similar to the 50-year remaining life expectancy of Quek. The investment choices of the claimants there in respect of their FME awards, as driven by their specific needs and goals based on their age at least, would likely be most comparable to those of Quek (see above at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 There is, however, quite a large disparity in the discount rates reflected in the FME multipliers in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>(4.80% per annum) and in <span class="font-italic">TV Media</span> (5.89% per annum). On facts of this case, we prefer the discount rate of 4.80% per annum applied in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span>. First, the position that Quek was in at the time of the assessment of damages was closer to that of the 22-year-old male claimant in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span> than that of the 29-year-old female claimant in <span class="font-italic">TV Media</span>. Second, the economic circumstances of today are more similar to those in 2012 when <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>was decided, than those in 2004 when <span class="font-italic">TV Media</span> was decided. Third, the multiplier in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>appears to have been determined on a more persuasive basis: the court in <span class="font-italic">TV Media</span> appears to have considered only the age of the claimant (see <span class="font-italic">TV Media</span> at [183]), whereas the court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>explicitly considered the effect of accelerated receipt and other contingencies (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 But more importantly perhaps, the implicit rate of return for awards of damages in Singapore has been between 4% and 5% per annum (see <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai </span>at [28]). Although adjustments for contingencies may raise the discount rate beyond this range, multiplier awards involving discount rates significantly above the upper end of the range (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5% per annum) should, in our view, be treated with caution. This is particularly the case given the climate of low interest rates that has persisted for the past 15 years and which continues today (see above at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Accordingly, we apply the discount rate of 4.80% per annum in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong </span>to Quek’s 50-year remaining life expectancy. This gives a multiplier of 19.7 years. In light of the possibility that the claimant in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wei Kong</span>, unlike Quek,<span class="font-italic"> </span>would not require FME for the entirety of the remainder of his life, we award Quek a 20-year FME multiplier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is important, at this juncture, to emphasise the fact that the analysis that is entailed in proceedings of this nature is – as we have already noted – an interactive one in at least two ways. It is interactive inasmuch as no single approach applies in a dogmatic or mechanistic fashion and, hence, the Precedent Approach and the Arithmetic Approach in fact complement each other – until such time when authoritative actuarial tables are available (a task which is outside the remit of the courts). We have also attempted to introduce more nuance into the process by considering discount rates (in addition to discount amounts) – thus facilitating an at least potentially more accurate ascertainment of the appropriate multiplier through a more nuanced interaction between the multipliers in the existing precedents, on the one hand, and the actual facts as well as the context of the case at hand, on the other (this being a second, and slightly different, process of interaction).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplicand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 We turn now to consider the appropriate multiplicand for FME.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Daily prostheses </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We agree with the Judge’s award of the costs of the use and replacement of a K3 prosthesis to Quek at a rate of $3,585.30 per annum for the remainder of his life.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We do not accept Quek’s submission that he needs a K4 prosthesis. Quek’s own expert, Dr Euan Wilson (“Dr Wilson”), testified that Quek needs only a K3 prosthesis, and accepted that a K4 prosthesis is “not something that [Quek] needs at the moment”. The only sporting interest that Quek has demonstrated is that of archery, and Dr Wilson accepted that a K3 prosthesis is sufficient for archery. Finally, although Quek appears to have worn out the first K3 prosthesis with which he was fitted on or around 28 October 2011 earlier than expected, there is no evidence that the K3 prosthesis that was installed in its place has been inadequate for Quek’s needs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 We do not accept Yeo’s submission that Quek should be downgraded to a K2 prosthesis after the age of 60 years.

Although Dr Wilson had suggested such a figure in his expert report, he had accepted in cross-examination that he did not expect the prices of K3 prostheses to be any more than their current prices.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Single K4 prosthesis</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 We set aside the Judge’s award of $7,276.00 for the costs of the single K4 prosthesis that Quek had purchased to explore his options while adjusting to his post-amputation situation. These costs had been awarded to Quek as part of his special damages for pre-trial medical expenses, and should not have been awarded again as general damages for FME. Quek was thus compensated twice over for his loss. The setting aside of this part of the Judge’s award does not affect the calculation of interest because the Judge awarded interest on general damages only in respect of pain and suffering (see the GD at [113] and [119]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Aqua limb</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 We agree with the Judge’s award of the costs of an aqua limb to Quek at a rate of $710.00 per annum for the remainder of his life. Quek is entitled to such compensation as is reasonably necessary to restore him to the position he was in before the Accident. It is a real possibility that Quek will have in the future to shower in bathrooms that have not been adapted to his needs. To require Quek to shower in such bathrooms while sitting down or balancing on one leg would be to impose an onerous burden on him, and the Judge cannot be faulted for seeking to spare Quek this burden by an award of an aqua limb.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Neuroma and right collarbone surgeries</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 We agree with the Judge’s award of provisional damages.

This was “in view of the physical demands made on a [manual worker] by the nature of his job” (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It was undisputed that but for the Accident, Quek would likely have been engaged in manual work, given his relatively low level of education. However, Quek submits that he would likely have worked past the minimum retirement age of 67 years due to his low level of education. On the other hand, Yeo argues that Quek would likely experience difficulty in remaining employed in his later years due to his declining physical abilities. In our view, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate either possibility on a balance of probabilities. We will thus take 67 years as Quek’s retirement age and adopt a remaining working life of 43 years to calculate his LFE/LEC multiplier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The approach for calculating the LFE/LEC multiplier should be similar to that for calculating the FME multiplier. Where possible, both the Precedent Approach and the Arithmetic Approach should be used, with the multiplier derived under each approach cross-checked against the multiplier derived under the other.

The claimants in those cases were, like Quek, young persons who had long remaining working lives of over 40 years at the time of their assessments of damages. They were also likely to have worked in Singapore for the remainder of their working lives.

In such a case, the loss will be calculated based on a multiplier and a multiplicand, the multiplicand being the monthly loss in pay and the multiplier being the appropriate period over which to compute the loss. In contrast, where the injured party does not suffered [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] an immediate wage reduction … but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some point in the future and he may, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or getting an equally well-paid job in the open market, then the LEC would be the correct basis to compensate him for the loss. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Although we proceeded to observe in <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Ai Ling </span>at [38] that LFE can be awarded to a claimant who is a young child or a student who has yet to enter the labour market, we emphasised that there must be “sufficient objective facts or evidence to enable the court to reasonably make the assessment”. In particular, there must be a stream of future income that the claimant had a reasonable expectation of earning, and of which he or she was deprived by virtue of the accident. Such was the case in <span class="font-italic">AOD</span>, where it was undisputed that the 9-year-old claimant would have started work at 22 years of age, and neither party suggested that the claimant would not have remained employed thereafter. George Wei J thus pegged the LFE multiplicand to the national averages, which he calculated by averaging the commencing salaries across the eight broad occupational groups in what appears to be the MoM Tables. Similarly, in the Singapore High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Eddie </span><span class="font-italic">Toon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Diana and another v Tan Miang Lee </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Diana</span>”), on which Quek relied in support of his claim for LFE, there was no evidence that the claimants would not have entered and then remained in the workforce. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The MoM Tables that Quek submits enable the calculation of LFE in his case simply provide objective data from which mean salaries can be extrapolated. However, before an award of LFE can be made, the claimant must demonstrate that <span class="font-italic">he</span> had in fact been preparing to embark on a career. Such evidence is lacking in Quek’s case. Quek dropped out of school without completing Secondary Three and has had a very sketchy employment history since. In the four years between dropping out of school and enlisting in National Service, he was unable to secure a full-time job and shuttled between part-time jobs. Moreover, as the Judge found, Quek has been unable to demonstrate a sustained interest in or aptitude for any trade, having been dismissed on grounds of tardiness from his employment with TC Homeplus (in 2008, before the Accident) and again with Unique Motorsports (in 2016, after the Accident). Unlike the claimants in <span class="font-italic">AOD</span>, <span class="font-italic">Eddie</span><span class="font-italic"> Toon</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Diana</span>, it is unclear as to whether Quek could even have obtained employment and continued in such employment. There was therefore no stream of future income that Quek could point to justify an award of LFE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The mere existence of national income statistics such as the MoM Tables cannot, in of itself, justify an award of LFE. Otherwise, every claimant will almost invariably be entitled to an award of LFE, for recourse can easily be had to national income statistics, and the court is unlikely to accept a proposition that someone is completely inept. A claimant who would have in the absence of the accident earned an income well below the national average could, simply by refusing to provide evidence on his income, place himself in a position to receive the national average income. Such enrichment goes beyond the permissible scope of compensation for personal injuries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 We thus agree with the Judge that there are insufficient objective facts or evidence to enable the court to reasonably assess LFE in Quek’s case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplicand for LEC </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 We agree with the Judge’s award of $750.00 per month for LEC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Yeo relies almost exclusively on <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Kiat</span>, which the Judge applied in awarding Quek an 18-year multiplier of LFE/LEC, to contend that Quek should receive only $500.00 per month as his multiplicand for LEC. In <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Kiat </span>at [13] and [16], Selvam J awarded the 28-year-old claimant a multiplicand of $500.00 per month after finding that the claimant had suffered approximately a 25% loss of his pre-accident earning capacity of $2,100.00 per month. However, Selvam J noted at [13] that the claimant had “magnified [his loss of earning capacity] to maximise his claim for damages” and “psychologically opt[ed] out of hard work in the hope of recovering his perceived loss of earnings from the defendant who in fact was an insurance company”. In contrast, the Judge found in this case that it was “clear that [Quek’s] injuries have <span class="font-italic">significantly</span> reduced his employability” [emphasis added] (see the GD at [89]). Moreover, Yeo does not dispute the Judge’s finding that Quek can no longer carry loads of over 20kg (see the GD at [89]), and in fact conceded in his submissions that Quek’s “physical disability … may likely weaken his competitive position in the open labour market”. Although Quek accepts that his employment with Unique Motorsports was terminated because of his tardiness, Yeo does not challenge Quek’s evidence that he struggled with the heavy loads that he was required to manoeuvre, even in a “sales admin” job with Unique Motorsports. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Although <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Kiat</span> was reported only in the first volume of the Singapore Law Reports for 2003, it was actually decided in 2000, which was 16 years before the assessment of damages in Quek’s case.
