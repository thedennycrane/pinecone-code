A discount rate of 8% was then applied to this difference. Crescendas contended that the Multi-Year Model reflected the full loss it suffered and was preferable to the “Single-Year Model”, which only calculated Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue in the year of 2010.

It is sufficient for the purposes of these Appeals to summarise the Judge’s key findings which were appealed against. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 To begin with, the Judge held that both Crescendas’ and JP’s delays were effective causes of Crescendas’ loss (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment (HC) </span>at [72]), and that the loss caused by the entire period of delay should be apportioned proportionately between the parties, based on the duration of delay attributable to each (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment (HC) </span>at [81]). Given that JP was accountable for 161 out of 334 days of the Combined Delay, it was liable for 48.2% of the total recoverable loss (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [82]). In the Judge’s opinion, the maximum amount of general damages that JP was liable for was also not limited to the amount of liquidated damages it would have otherwise been liable for under cl 6.0 of the LOI (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [57]–[62]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As regards Crescendas’ claim for its “loss of chance” to earn net rental revenue, the Judge characterised this claim as a claim for “loss of net rental revenue” (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [85]). He proceeded to observe that this claim comprised two distinct categories of loss. First, the “loss of net rental revenue” <span class="font-italic">during</span> the period of the Combined Delay (“pre-completion net rental revenue loss”). Secondly, the “loss of net rental revenue” <span class="font-italic">after</span> the completion of Biopolis 3 (“post-completion net rental revenue loss”) (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment </span><span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>at [93]). This is similar to Crescendas’ claims for pre-completion and post-completion loss mentioned at [13] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On remoteness, the Judge held that pre-completion net rental revenue loss was not too remote as it was a natural consequence of the Combined Delay. As for post-completion net rental revenue loss, the Judge was of the view that Crescendas had accepted it as “indirect loss”. On this premise, the Judge found that the latter was too remote to be recoverable as Crescendas had not shown that JP had actual knowledge that the delay would cause further net rental revenue loss even after completion (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment (HC) </span>at [96]–[102]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On the issue of quantifying Crescendas’ net rental revenue loss, the Judge preferred the Single-Year Model to the Multi-Year Model even though the latter was preferred by Crescendas’ experts, as well as the Court’s expert Adjunct Assoc Prof Tay Kah Poh (“Assoc Prof Tay”). The Judge held that the Single-Year Model provided the “fairest and most appropriate method of quantifying [Crescendas’] loss of net rental revenue” (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment (HC) </span>at [104]–[128]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Judge adopted the following formula in the Single-Year Model to derive net rental revenue loss amounting to $4,056,711.62 for the whole of 2010 (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment (HC) </span>at [131] and [227]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">(First-year occupancy rate in 2010) × NLA <br/>× <br/> of rent) <br/>× <br/></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Judge pro-rated $4,056,711.62 to reflect the 334 days of the Combined Delay, and arrived at $3,712,168.99:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">(334/365) × $4,056,711.62 = $3,712,168.99</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Judge then apportioned $3,712,168.99 based on 161 out of 334 days to reflect JP’s liability.

This difference is not one of semantics. The loss in question is substantively different. The loss that Crescendas appeared to be alluding to was the <span class="font-italic">chance</span> to earn net rental revenue, whereas the Judge recharacterised the loss as the <span class="font-italic">net rental revenue</span> which Crescendas did not earn due to the Combined Delay.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Accordingly, a preliminary question arises as to whether Crescendas was in substance seeking damages for a loss of chance or whether it was in substance claiming for the loss of net rental revenue, as held by the Judge. In our view, the Judge had correctly recognised that Crescendas’ claim was in substance a claim for loss of net rental revenue and not a claim for loss of chance, as such. We add that notwithstanding Crescendas’ use of the phrase “loss of chance”, it had in substance proceeded on the basis that it was claiming for loss of net rental revenue. Likewise, JP also proceeded along the line that that was the claim of Crescendas. Indeed, neither side really identified what the chance was that was purportedly lost. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is pertinent to first set the context in which the loss of chance doctrine arises. This doctrine has to be understood against the compensatory principle which undergirds the award of damages for a breach of contract. This principle is enshrined in the famous English decision of <span class="font-italic">Robinson v Harman </span>(1848) 1 Exch 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Robinson</span>”), where Parke B said at 855:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rule of the common law is that where a party sustains loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It follows that to give effect to the compensatory principle, the court has to compare the position the claimant would have been in had the contract not been breached (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “hypothetical no-breach position”), and the position the claimant is currently in given that the contract has been breached (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “breach position”). Where the claimant is worse off in the latter, the difference between the two positions represents the claimant’s loss: see Adam Kramer KC, <span class="font-italic">The Law </span><span class="font-italic">of Contract Damages</span> (Hart Publishing, 3rd Ed, 2022) at paras 1-39 and 1-46 to 1-48; <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) at para 21.002 (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Closely connected to the compensatory principle and the identification of loss is the issue of whether that loss is <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> a result of the defendant’s contractual breach. Factual causation is determined by reference to the “but for” test, which requires the claimant to prove on a balance of probabilities that but for the defendant’s breach, it would not have suffered loss (<span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Ming Eric</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span>”) at [63] and [71]). Implicit in this is once again a comparison between the hypothetical no-breach position and the breach position. If the balance of probabilities tips in the claimant’s favour in respect of the “but for” test for causation, the claimant is taken as having shown, as a matter of fact, the causal link between the defendant’s contractual breach and the claimant’s loss, and that entitles the claimant to recover in full from the defendant, with no account being taken of the degree of strength of the proof. If, on the other hand, the claimant fails to persuade the court of the causal link on a balance of probabilities, the claim will fail regardless of how close the strength of proof came to overcoming the balance of probabilities: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> at [74]. It is for this reason that the “but for” test is described as taking an all-or-nothing approach to factual causation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This all-or-nothing approach is particularly problematic in situations where the occurrence of loss is contingent upon the acts of third parties to the contract that has been breached. In these circumstances, the claimant is saddled with the difficult task of having to establish on a balance of probabilities that the third party would have acted in a relevant manner to confer on the claimant a favourable outcome if not for the defendant’s contractual breach: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract </span><span class="font-italic">in Singapore</span> at para 21.154.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 These problems are ameliorated by the loss of chance doctrine, which allows a claimant to claim for the loss of a <span class="font-italic">chance</span> of a favourable outcome (rather than the favourable outcome itself), where that favourable outcome is contingent on the action of a third party: see <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> at [74]; <span class="font-italic">Justlogin</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 425 at [38]; <span class="font-italic">Auston International Group Ltd and another v Ng Swee Hua</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 628 at [38]; <span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK and another </span>[2022] SGHC(I) 2 at [200]–[207]. Where the claim is premised on a loss of chance, the claimant needs to show that the defendant’s contractual breach caused it to lose a chance of acquiring a favourable outcome, and that this chance is a real and substantial one. In other words, there is a real and substantial chance (which may well be less than 50%) of the third party acting in such a way as to confer the favourable outcome on the claimant in the hypothetical no-breach position: see <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd and another </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 661 (“<span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [139]; <span class="font-italic">MK </span><span class="font-italic">Distripark Pte Ltd v Pedder Warehousing &amp; Logistics (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 433 (“<span class="font-italic">MK </span><span class="font-italic">Distripark</span>”) at [58]. However, the claimant need not go further and undertake the more challenging task of showing on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a more than 50% likelihood) that the third party would have behaved so as to confer the favourable outcome in the hypothetical no-breach position. This is because the loss is not the favourable outcome <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but the loss of the chance to obtain that foreseeable outcome (see <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span> at [133]). In other words, the loss of chance doctrine allows the claimant to avert the difficulty of proving that the claimant <span class="font-italic">would </span>have acquired the favourable outcome, by allowing the claimant to claim that he <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could </span><span class="font-weight-bold">(not </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">would</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)</span> have obtained the favourable outcome but for the breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 A claim on a loss of chance basis also avoids an all-or-nothing outcome. This is illustrated in Vinodh Coomaraswamy J’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">AKM v AKN and another and other matters</span> [2014] 4 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">AKM</span>”) at [184]–[186], where he compared a claim for the loss of actual profits with a claim for the loss of a chance to earn profits (this point was not overturned on appeal in <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">184 … [T]here is to my mind a substantive distinction between the two ways of looking at loss. In a claim for the loss of actual profits, the plaintiff asserts that but for the breach of contract, he <span class="font-italic">would</span> (not <span class="font-italic">could</span>) have earned profits. In other words, the plaintiff is asserting a direct link between the breach and the loss. If the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">succeeds</span> in proving that link, he is entitled to full compensation for his loss. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">fails</span> to prove that direct link, he recovers nothing.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">185 Damages assessed on the basis of actual lost profits is thus an all or nothing exercise. This is an important point. Even if the finder of fact is of the view that there is only a 51% chance that the plaintiff would have gone on to earn the profits claimed if the breach had not occurred, the plaintiff recovers full compensation. He does not recover 51% of his loss. By the same token, even if the finder of fact is satisfied that the plaintiff’s chance of going on to earn the profits claimed is as high as 49%, the plaintiff recovers nothing. He does not recover 49% of his loss.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">186 The position is completely different when a plaintiff presents his loss as a lost opportunity to earn profits. On that analysis, the plaintiff asserts that but for the breach of contract, he <span class="font-italic">could</span> (not <span class="font-italic">would</span>) have earned profits. On this analysis, the plaintiff concedes that his ability to earn profits is subject to events beyond his control (for example, because of the actions of a third party). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In sum, a claimant must ordinarily establish a causal link between the contractual breach and the alleged loss. This, however, is an uphill task where the loss consists of a favourable outcome which is dependent on third party action, and the claimant, who has no control over what the third party chooses to do, has to prove the causal link on an all-or-nothing basis. To relieve the burden on the claimant, the loss of chance doctrine allows the claimant to characterise the loss as being the <span class="font-italic">chance</span> of securing the favourable outcome, thus making it easier for the claimant to prove the causal link between the loss and the contractual breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It follows that for the purpose of the loss of chance doctrine, the favourable outcome should not be identified by reference to the exact quantity of the value lost. Instead, it should be characterised at a lower level (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the chance of winning a beauty contest or of securing a contract with a third party) upon a comparison between the state of affairs in the breach position and the hypothetical no-breach position, this being part and parcel of the loss identification and factual causation assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Once that is kept in focus, it becomes clear that Crescendas’ case was not for the loss of chance to earn net rental revenue but rather for the loss of the revenue itself. In the present case, the favourable outcome is the gain of additional net rental revenue in the hypothetical no-breach position which was not earned in the breach position. Had Crescendas’ claim truly been for a loss of chance to earn net rental revenue, it would have said that it <span class="font-italic">might or might not</span> have earned additional net rental revenue in the hypothetical no-breach position, but that this chance was lost due to the breach. But that was not how Crescendas ran its case. Instead, Crescendas ran its entire case on the basis that but for JP’s breach, it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">would </span><span class="font-weight-bold">(not </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)</span> have earned additional net rental revenue. Crescendas’ experts projected that its net rental revenue in the hypothetical no-breach position would exceed what it actually earned in the breach position, and Crescendas relied on the difference between the two to compute the additional net rental revenue it would have earned.

</div> Thus, Crescendas’ “loss of chance” claim was really a misnomer. The pith and marrow of Crescendas’ claim was, in truth, for the loss of net rental revenue. We are reinforced in our view by the fact that JP, in its written closing submissions before the Judge, perceived Crescendas’ claim as one relating to the loss of net rental revenue.

</div> First, there was no demonstratable causal link between the specific periods of delay attributable to JP and the loss allegedly suffered by Crescendas. Not only was Crescendas the dominant cause of the delay, the delays caused by Crescendas were also spread out throughout the entire duration of the project (both before and after the reasonable date for completion on 14 July 2010) and were so closely intertwined with the delays caused by JP that a clear causal link could not be drawn between Crescendas’ loss and JP’s delay.

As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [60], “[a] claimant may recover damages for a loss only where the breach of contract was the ‘effective’ or ‘dominant’ cause of that loss”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The following cases illustrate what happens when the loss caused is not <span class="font-italic">solely</span> attributable to the defendant (or defendants as the case may be) against whom the claim is being pursued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Heskell</span><span class="font-italic"> v Continental Express Ltd and another </span>[1950] 1 All ER 1033 (“<span class="font-italic">Heskell</span>”), the plaintiff had entered into an agreement to sell goods to a Persian buyer. The plaintiff instructed the first defendant, in whose warehouse the goods were, to despatch the goods. The first defendant failed to despatch the goods, but the second defendant (the shipowner’s loading brokers) issued a bill of lading for the goods which were never shipped. The first defendant argued that it was only responsible for any loss up till the time the false bill of lading was issued, and the second defendant was responsible for any loss incurred after that. Devlin J (as he then was) held that the second defendant’s issuance of a false bill of lading did not extinguish the first defendant’s breach of duty as a causative event and that the first defendant’s breach, being a continuing one, was a continuous source of damage. The two causes of damage were equally operative, in the sense that if either had ceased the damage would have ceased. Accordingly, the first defendant’s breach was held to be sufficiently causative of the plaintiff’s loss (<span class="font-italic">Heskell</span> at 1047). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the case of <span class="font-italic">Great Eastern Hotel Company Ltd v John Laing Construction Ltd and another</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[2005] EWHC 181 (TCC) (“<span class="font-italic">Great Eastern</span>”), the claimant sought damages against the construction managers for delays in the completion of works to a hotel.

Due to the defendant’s breach in providing defective works, the clinic was flooded. This prevented the plaintiff from resuming business at the clinic. As a result of the plaintiff not resuming business as well as the plaintiff’s failure to pay rent timeously, the landlord charged the plaintiff rent for what would otherwise have been a rent-free period. Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) held that the defendant was still liable for the amount of rent paid even though both its breach and the plaintiff’s failure to pay rent on time were causes of this particular loss, citing at [25] the case of <span class="font-italic">Heskell</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When the breach of a contract is one of two causes, ‘[t]he contract-breaker is liable so long as his breach was ‘an’ effective cause of [the plaintiff’s] loss: the court need not choose which cause was the more effective’ (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chitty on Contracts</span> vol 1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2018) (‘<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chitty on </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Contracts</span>’) at para 26-076).

We agree, given that the length of the delay attributable to Crescendas and JP respectively were almost evenly balanced, with 161 days attributable to JP and 173 days attributable to Crescendas.

However, the Project was only completed on 22 December 2010 (see [244] above). Thus, the delay to the Project that is attributable to the defendant is 133 days (this being the difference between the new completion date of 9 August 2010 and the date on which the Project was completed, 22 December 2010).

</div> Notwithstanding this disclosure, the settlement agreement itself was not adduced in evidence nor was any representative from PetNet called as a witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 We have mentioned JP's alternative arguments, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as to whether the Combined Delay had caused the loss of PetNet as a tenant. At the hearing, we asked counsel for JP to clarify JP’s position.

Hence, this is the primary focus for the analysis that follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Although the Judge had been of the view that the correspondence between PetNet and Crescendas did not clearly indicate the reason for PetNet’s decision not to lease premises at Biopolis 3, he went on to find that the Combined Delay had caused PetNet not to take up the lease due to its expressed concerns about the delay in construction affecting its project plans (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment (HC) </span>at [163]). However, in our judgment, apart from the isolated incident in January 2009 detailed above (at [74]), PetNet did not bring up the issue of delay in its negotiations with Crescendas up to and including in its last documented discussion with Crescendas in September 2011.

If you look at the conduct, they came into Singapore. We incur millions of dollars building a cyclotron for them, and the negotiation was actually quite long, as we can see; almost -- I don't know -- one and a half, two years. And suddenly they have to say, okay -- almost, like, wind down and say, ‘Okay, I'm not going to sign your agreement; I'm going off.’ You know, I mean, look at all this. I think it is -- in my mind, right, it is not something that I'm imagining and something that's wild, you know. It's a genuine company coming here, and because of the long delay and they were brought to a timeline where their business -- their type of business no longer is competitive, and they have to go. So, to me, just look at the conduct, the events. I think we all can appreciate that it's not just simply a company coming in and change their mind, say, ‘Since I did not sign a contract, I'm going off.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 More importantly, if the Combined Delay had been the reason for PetNet declining to lease premises at Biopolis 3, then there would be no logical reason for PetNet to agree to pay Crescendas any sum as a settlement. The fact that PetNet agreed to and did pay the Settlement Sum strongly suggested that it was not walking away because of any delay in the construction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In our view, the Judge had erred in not giving due weight to the correspondence between the parties, the invoices from Crescendas to PetNet and the fact that it was PetNet who paid Crescendas the Settlement Sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Accordingly, Crescendas has not discharged its evidential burden to show that it lost PetNet as a tenant because of the Combined Delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, we would also make some observations about the way in which the issue of the Settlement Sum had been brought up in the proceedings below. As discussed above at [77], the only documentary evidence of the Settlement Sum was an anonymous reference to “a prospective tenant”. It was not until the cross-examination of Mr Leow that it was disclosed that PetNet had made a payment to Crescendas for forgoing a lease at Biopolis 3.

</div> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In our view, the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">late disclosure of the Settlement Sum was unsatisfactory. The audited financial statement which did not even provide any details as to the Settlement Sum or the identity of the prospective tenant was inadequate. If there was concern about other confidential information in the settlement agreement which was not relevant to the trial, those parts of the settlement agreement could have been redacted. Since Crescendas was claiming that it had lost PetNet as a tenant because of the Combined Delay, it was obliged to disclose the settlement agreement even if it took the view that the Settlement Sum was paid by PetNet for a reason other than the omission to proceed with a lease. It was for Crescendas to disclose and state its position and for the court to decide whether the settlement agreement was relevant and indeed material.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Since Crescendas has not shown that it lost PetNet as a tenant because of the Combined Delay (see above at [83]), JP is not liable to Crescendas for any loss of rent from PetNet.

Ordinary damage is awarded for consequences which may be seen as arising naturally (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, according to the usual course of things) from the breach of contract itself or flowing from what may reasonably be supposed to be in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract, having regard to the knowledge of the relevant surrounding circumstances that the contract breaker would generally be taken to have had.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Damage falling under the second limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale </span>(the “Second Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>”) may be termed “extraordinary” damage. Such damage is not by its very nature within the reasonable contemplation of contracting parties. Neither does it flow naturally from the breach of contract. Rather, it arises due to special circumstances which are outside the usual course of things. For there to be liability for extraordinary damage, the contract breaker must have had actual knowledge of these special circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The overarching criterion of the loss being in “reasonable contemplation” applies to both limbs. For the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>, the horizon of contemplation is confined to loss which arises naturally (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the usual course of things) and which is therefore presumed to have been in the contemplation of parties. For the Second Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>, by reason of the actual knowledge possessed by the contract breaker of the special circumstances giving rise to the extraordinary damage, the horizon of contemplation is extended to loss that does not arise in the usual course of things (<span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span> at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary issue: whether Crescendas’ case on appeal is inconsistent with its case in the proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Before going into the remoteness analysis proper, a preliminary issue which arises is whether Crescendas’ case on appeal departed from its case in the proceedings below in so far as the remoteness of post-completion net rental revenue loss is concerned. The Judge understood Crescendas as having argued that pre-completion net rental revenue loss constituted ordinary damage but post-completion net rental revenue loss constituted extraordinary damage (see <span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC) </span>at [90] and [97]). However, Crescendas argued before us that the entirety of its claim, for pre- and post-completion net rental revenue loss, constituted ordinary damage. JP pointed out the discrepancy in Crescendas’ position below and on appeal in relation to post-completion net rental revenue loss, and submitted that Crescendas was precluded by the doctrine of approbation and reprobation from submitting that post-completion net rental revenue loss was ordinary damage.

</div> As a result, JP had ample opportunity in the proceedings below to meet Crescendas’ case that its post-completion net rental revenue loss satisfied the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. In our view, if Crescendas were permitted to argue on appeal, as it did, that its post-completion net rental revenue loss satisfied the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>, JP would not be prejudiced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In truth, the only party which had suffered prejudice was Crescendas itself. It had led the Judge into thinking that its primary case was that its post-completion net rental revenue loss was extraordinary damage falling within the Second Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. The Judge then agreed with Crescendas’ “concession” that the post-completion net rental revenue loss fell within the Second Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v </span><span class="font-italic">Baxendale</span>, and found that Crescendas had not shown that JP had actual knowledge that the delay in completion would cause Crescendas to suffer post-completion net rental revenue loss. The Judge therefore held that Crescendas’ post-completion net rental revenue loss was too remote to be recoverable (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC) </span>at [97]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As mentioned, JP argued that Crescendas was precluded by the doctrine of approbation and reprobation from arguing on appeal that post-completion net rental revenue loss fell within the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. We note that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation bars a claimant from running a case on appeal that is inconsistent with its case in the proceedings below, if that claimant had in fact obtained some benefit from its chosen course in the proceedings below (see <span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1 Pte Ltd v Industries </span><span class="font-italic">Chimiques Du Senegal and another appeal and another matter </span>[2021] 1 SLR 342 at [100]).

</div> However, Crescendas clearly did not benefit from taking the position that its case was that its post-completion net rental revenue loss was extraordinary damage falling within the Second Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. On the contrary, it was JP who obtained the benefit of the Judge’s ruling based on that concession. In our view, the doctrine of approbation and reprobation will not stand in the way of permitting Crescendas to argue in these Appeals that its post-completion net rental revenue loss constitutes ordinary damage for the purposes of the remoteness analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For the above reasons, we allow Crescendas to argue in these Appeals that its post-completion net rental revenue loss satisfied the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. Nevertheless, Crescendas deserves to be criticised for its inconsistent positions and for not being immediately candid that its argument on appeal was inconsistent with its written reply submissions below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Crescendas’ pre- and post-completion net rental revenue loss satisfy the First Limb of Hadley v Baxendale</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Before the Judge, JP argued that the loss of net rental revenue is the “most remote” form of loss. It submitted that Crescendas’ entire claim for net rental revenue loss fell within the Second Limb instead of the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span> because this loss did not flow naturally from a breach of contract but arose from circumstances outside of JP’s control, such as Crescendas’ pricing strategy, negotiations between Crescendas and prospective tenants, each prospective tenant’s decision-making calculus, and the global financial crisis back in late 2008. It stressed that JP, a management contractor, was only responsible for building Biopolis 3 and would not be aware of how Crescendas would deal with Biopolis 3 upon completion, what the negotiated rental rates with prospective tenants would be and what the market conditions would be following completion.

</div>
</div> Counsel for JP also made the point in oral submissions that Holding Costs form a more foreseeable head of loss than the loss of net rental revenue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 We are of the view that the two cases cited by JP do not assist it. In <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics</span>, the claimant bought a reel drive unit (“RDU”) from the defendant pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement. The defendant breached the agreement by not delivering an RDU that was of merchantable quality and fit for its purpose, and the claimant sought damages in respect of loss of revenue or profit which the RDU would have made over a period of normal utility (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 15 years) if it had been properly designed and manufactured. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics</span> at [155] found that this claim for loss of revenue or profit did not fall within the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale </span>because there was insufficient evidence that the parties knew that the RDU would be rented out by the claimant for its entire period of normal utility. In our view, the Court of Appeal was not setting out or applying a general proposition of law that loss of profits or revenue can never fall within the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. It was simply applying rules on remoteness to the evidence before it. Further, in so far as the facts are concerned, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics</span> was dealing with a situation where the breach consisted of a failure to supply a machine of merchantable quality that was fit for purpose, whereas the breach in the case at hand concerns a delay in completing a building which JP must have known would be rented to multiple tenants. The kind of loss that would naturally flow from these two breaches, which are distinctively different in character, would necessarily be different. A factual finding on the issue of remoteness in one does not necessarily apply to the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>, the builder sought a declaration from the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales that the liquidated damages clause in its agreement with the proprietor should be unenforceable for being a penalty clause, on the ground that the liquidated damages clause required the builder to pay the proprietor holding costs for the period of delay attributable to the builder (at 505–506) instead of loss of rent. The builder, in support of this declaration, argued (amongst other arguments) that a proprietor that retains the project after completion for leasing purposes would only suffer loss in the form of delayed cash flow from rental in consequence of the builder’s delay. It argued that using the holding costs of the project during the period of delay as a pre-estimate of the proprietor’s damage is accordingly inappropriate (at 517). The <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> of that case is that liquidated damages payable for tardy performance need not encompass all damage which the proprietor may, although not necessarily will, suffer from such late performance. If holding charges for the duration of delay is damage which will be suffered by a proprietor, although it may not be the entirety of such damage, a liquidated damages clause providing for full payment of holding charges would not be a penalty (at 519–520).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In the course of his analysis, however, Cole J also observed<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 519–521):</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… [An] agreement between the proprietor and the builder in the building contract regarding liquidated damages payable for tardy performance need not encompass all damages which in truth the proprietor may, although not necessarily will, suffer from such late performance.

</div>
</div>
</div> It is important to bear in mind that, interestingly, in that case, the contract-breaker proceeded on the basis that the ordinary damage from delayed completion was loss of rent and not holding costs. It disputed the plaintiff’s claim because the plaintiff was claiming holding costs and not loss of rent. It was in that context that Cole J expressed the view that holding costs, and not loss of rent, was ordinary damage. In our case, unlike the contract-breaker in <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>JP had argued below that loss of net rental revenue was not ordinary damage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In any event, we depart from the views of Cole J. In our view, the loss of rent is an ordinary, and thus foreseeable, loss arising from delayed completion especially when the main contractor must have been aware that the building will be let out. Holding costs may also be claimable as an alternative, or in addition, to loss of rent depending on how the loss of rent is calculated. Cole J had erred in thinking that holding costs was ordinary damage but not loss of rent. It could be either or both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 On the facts, the pre-completion net rental revenue loss came within the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. This was no longer disputed by JP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 We are also of the view that post-completion net rental revenue loss came within the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span> in principle. As will be explained below at [146]–[148], the Combined Delay had a multi-year impact on Crescendas’ net rental revenue stream and caused Crescendas to suffer post-completion net rental revenue loss in the years following the Combined Delay. Briefly, this is because Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted development which would have taken several years to fill up, and the lost prospective leases would have been for multi-year terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Here, both parties were aware that Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted development at the time of contracting.

</div>
</div>
</div> The fact that such a development would take multiple years to fill up was within the reasonable contemplation of parties at the time of contracting, and this is demonstrated by the fact that it is agreed between the parties and their experts that even in the absence of the Combined Delay, the reasonable time taken for Biopolis 3 to reach stabilised occupancy would have been four years (the concept of stabilised occupancy is elaborated below at [114]).

</div> In light of this, it must have been within parties’ reasonable contemplation that a considerable delay in completion of Biopolis 3 would disrupt Crescendas’ net rental revenue stream over multiple years, thus giving rise to post-completion net rental revenue loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Additionally, it would have been within the reasonable contemplation of parties that a not insubstantial delay in completion would, in the usual course of things, cause potential tenants to walk away from Biopolis 3 and that tenancies in the BMS R&amp;D industry would run for several years, instead of for one year, since costs would be incurred in the fitting-out and relocation. This was reinforced by the fact that all the experts who gave their view on which model should or can be used in this case agreed that tenancies in Biopolis 3 would be for multiple years.

</div> Be that as it may, this does not preclude the recoverability of post-completion net rental revenue loss under the First Limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. The conventional principle is that the contract breaker will be held liable for the full extent of the loss as long as the <span class="font-italic">type or kind</span> of loss that has occurred was reasonably contemplated at the time of the contract, <span class="font-italic">even if its precise detail or extent were not</span>: <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box</span> at [41]. The circumstances enumerated by JP affect the precise quantum of post-completion net rental revenue loss sustained by Crescendas.

The stabilised occupancy level refers to the percentage of NLA that would be leased once Biopolis 3 achieved its market potential, and the percentage at which the occupancy level would remain steady over a long period of time.

</div> On appeal, parties did not dispute that net rental revenue loss under the Multi-Year Model would be calculated from 23 January 2010 to January 2015. In contrast, the Single-Year Model assesses the net rental revenue loss suffered by Crescendas during the period of the Combined Delay (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 23 January 2010 to 22 December 2010).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Secondly, both models are similar in that they put into practice the compensatory principle which undergirds the entire assessment of damages exercise. Both models do so by finding the difference between (a) the net rental revenue that Crescendas would have earned if the Combined Delay had not occurred (the “No-Delay Scenario”) and (b) the net rental revenue that Crescendas would have earned had it taken reasonable mitigatory steps in light of the Combined Delay (the “Delay Scenario”). Ordinarily, the Delay Scenario should have been based on Crescendas’ actual net rental revenue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 However, in the proceedings below, the parties were at odds as to whether the Delay Scenario in the Multi-Year Model should reflect net rental revenue that Crescendas <span class="font-italic">actually</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>earned, or net rental revenue which Crescendas <span class="font-italic">w</span><span class="font-italic">ould have earned</span> had it taken reasonable mitigatory steps. The Judge held that Crescendas did not take all reasonable steps to mitigate its loss of net rental revenue, and thus, the actual net rental revenue which Crescendas earned from January 2010 to January 2015 was in part due to the Combined Delay, and in part due to Crescendas’ failure to take all reasonable steps to mitigate its loss of net rental revenue. To remove the effect of Crescendas’ failure to take reasonable mitigatory steps, the Judge based the Delay Scenario on the projected net rental revenue reflecting what Crescendas <span class="font-italic">w</span><span class="font-italic">ould have earned</span> had it taken reasonable mitigatory steps, rather than the actual net rental revenue earned by Crescendas subsequent to the Combined Delay (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [236]–[237] and [246]–[247]). The Judge’s findings on this point are undisputed on appeal. Hence, the Multi-Year Model requires (a) a computation of what Crescendas <span class="font-italic">w</span><span class="font-italic">ould have earned</span> in the Delay Scenario if it had taken reasonable mitigatory steps, (b) a computation of what Crescendas would have earned in the No-Delay Scenario, and (c) a comparison of both figures to determine the loss in net rental revenue suffered by Crescendas as a result of the Combined Delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The same comparison is made in the Single-Year Model. However, as the Single-Year Model is only confined to the period of the Combined Delay during which Biopolis 3 had not been completed and no leasing could have taken place, the net rental revenue that Crescendas would have earned in the Delay Scenario would necessarily be zero. Any difference between the Delay and the No-Delay Scenarios would thus be entirely dependent on the net rental revenue which would have been earned in the No-Delay Scenario. Accordingly, the computation under the Single-Year Model focuses solely on the net rental revenue that Crescendas would have earned in the No-Delay Scenario during the Combined Delay in 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Thirdly, both models utilise the same variables to determine the projected net rental revenue in a particular year (see <span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [227] and [307]). The input variables for each model are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) occupancy level;</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) gross monthly rental rate; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) net rental revenue margin.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, because the Multi-Year Model assesses net rental revenue loss over multiple years and involves a comparison of the Delay and No-Delay Scenarios, these variables have to be computed across several years and for both scenarios. This is unlike the Single-Year Model, which only requires a computation of these variables for the period of the Combined Delay, and only in respect of the No-Delay Scenario. This is because, as mentioned at [117] above, the net rental revenue in the Delay Scenario would necessarily be zero. Thus, as Assoc Prof Tay pointed out, the Single-Year Model is effectively a truncated Multi-Year Model which focuses only on one year, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 2010.

In this regard, he noted Assoc Prof Tay’s view that the Single-Year Model was a legitimate method, and Assoc Prof Yu’s view that the Single-Year Model involved fewer assumptions and complications in arriving at a more precise quantum. On the other hand, Mr Toh opined that the Multi-Year Model was the only method of ascertaining Crescendas’ net rental revenue loss in this case (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [105]). Dr Woo did not expressly accept the Single-Year Model (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [104]). In the light of the conflicting expert evidence, the Judge turned to evaluate which of the two models is more appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The Judge accepted that the Multi-Year Model was a valuable tool for the purposes of accounting, financial planning and real estate valuation because it reflected the multi-year nature of real estate projects and leases. He also acknowledged that accounting and financial standards were instructive in the assessment of damages (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [111] and [125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 However, the Judge’s overarching considerations were that of fairness and equity. He found that the Multi-Year Model suffered from three shortcomings which did not satisfy the fundamental and cardinal pillar of fairness and equity for the purposes of assessing damages (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [111] and [125]). The three shortcomings were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The speculative nature of the Multi-Year Model, which depended on a multitude of variables that were uncertain, subjective, and which could be endlessly contested (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC) </span>at [112]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Multi-Year Model depended primarily on variables, such as the stabilised occupancy level, which were outside JP’s control (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC) </span>at [116]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Multi-Year Model was capable of yielding illogical and plainly inequitable outcomes. In particular, it was conceptually possible for the difference in net rental revenue between the No-Delay and Delay Scenarios to yield a negative figure (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [121]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We will address each of these shortcomings identified by the Judge later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In addition to these shortcomings, the Judge was also of the view that the Multi-Year Model infringed the principles on remoteness of damage (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [126]–[127]). The Judge reiterated that Crescendas was only entitled to recover pre-completion net rental revenue loss, as the post-completion net rental revenue loss was too remote to be recoverable (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [127]). In contrast, the Single-Year Model had a direct nexus to the loss of net rental revenue during the Combined Delay in 2010 and as a result, had taken into account the principles of remoteness and mitigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The Judge concluded that the Single-Year Model provided “the fairest and most appropriate method of quantifying [Crescendas’] loss of net rental revenue” (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [128]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The crux of Crescendas’ case on appeal was that the Single-Year Model led to undercompensation because it focused <span class="font-italic">only </span>on net rental revenue loss sustained during the Combined Delay (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pre-completion net rental revenue loss), when the Combined Delay had also caused post-completion net rental revenue loss over multiple years. In particular, the Combined Delay caused Crescendas to lose the pre-commitment tenants, and given that tenancies span over several years, the loss of these tenants alone meant that Crescendas missed out on a multi-year revenue stream over the term of each tenancy. Even if Crescendas subsequently secured other tenants to mitigate its loss, it would still suffer a multi-year loss because Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted building that would take time to fill up. Until stabilised occupancy was reached, there would still be “excess” capacity in Biopolis 3 which would otherwise have been filled up earlier if not for the Combined Delay.

</div> JP acknowledged that the fact that the Multi-Year Model was capable of yielding illogical and inequitable outcomes might not be a good enough reason on its own to reject the Multi-Year Model, but it nevertheless contended that it was still a valid consideration to be taken in the round when considering the extent to which it should be liable for the breach. It emphasised that anything could happen following the completion of Biopolis 3, and venturing into what could happen and what Crescendas could have done to mitigate its loss would be to venture into the realm of speculation over several years.

She explained that a tenancy would usually be for a minimum period of three years. If a tenant was secured, that tenant would stay through for multiple years and there would be a revenue stream over the multi-year term of the tenancy. Therefore, if a prospective tenant was lost, the developer would lose the first year’s income stream, plus the income stream from the remaining years of that prospective tenancy.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Evaluating the expert evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The expert evidence before us supports a finding that the Combined Delay had resulted in post-completion net rental revenue loss over multiple years. Such loss would result even if Crescendas had taken reasonable efforts to mitigate its loss. The key reason for this is that Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted development which would take several years to fill up. This, coupled with the fact that Crescendas’ income stream arose from multi-year leases with tenants in Biopolis 3, meant that the Combined Delay had as a matter of fact impacted Crescendas’ net rental revenue stream over several years. We elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 First, as Mr Toh and Assoc Prof Tay rightly pointed out, Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted development which would take several years to fill up because it was a large development which could only be leased out to a very specific type of tenant. It was not a building which could be filled up immediately once it was completed. Indeed, all parties agreed that Biopolis 3 would have taken four years to achieve stabilised occupancy in the No-Delay Scenario,

</div>
</div>
</div> and it was no longer disputed on appeal that Biopolis 3 would take four years to attain stabilised occupancy in the Delay Scenario. This feature of Biopolis 3 meant that a Combined Delay of approximately one year would impact the occupancy profile of Biopolis 3 over several years, and therefore result in post-completion net rental revenue loss over multiple years. To elaborate, in the absence of the Combined Delay, Biopolis 3 would have enjoyed a base level of 31.64% starting occupancy

</div>
</div> and Crescendas could focus its efforts on filling up the remainder of the building. However, when potential starting tenants were lost due to the Combined Delay, the specialised nature of Biopolis 3 meant that it would take some time to find other tenants to bring the occupancy level back up to 31.64% even with reasonable mitigatory efforts. The result is that Biopolis 3’s occupancy growth profile in the Delay Scenario would lag behind its occupancy growth profile in the No-Delay Scenario. The multi-year impact on Biopolis 3’s occupancy levels translated into a multi-year loss for Crescendas.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Secondly, each tenancy ran on a multi-year cycle, as recognised by Assoc Prof Tay, Mr Toh, Dr Woo and Assoc Prof Yu. Each tenancy thus supplied Crescendas with a multi-year rental revenue stream, such that the loss of a prospective starting tenant caused by the Combined Delay would lead to net rental revenue loss throughout the multi-year term of the lost prospective tenancy. This multi-year loss would not be stemmed even if Crescendas had taken reasonable mitigatory steps by securing another tenant, as the other tenant would not truly be a replacement tenant. This was attributable to the fact that Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted development which would take time to fill up. As Biopolis 3 would still have empty spaces for lease even after completion, securing another tenant would still leave Crescendas with an empty space in Biopolis 3 which would otherwise have been occupied by the lost prospective starting tenant. Put another way, without the Combined Delay, the additional tenant which Crescendas found would have been <span class="font-italic">in addition to</span> the lost tenant since there was space in Biopolis 3 to accommodate both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 For the above reasons, we find that the Combined Delay caused Crescendas to suffer post-completion net rental revenue loss over multiple years. This points strongly in favour of using the Multi-Year Model to compute Crescendas’ multi-year loss. The Single-Year Model, on the other hand, was defective in that it <span class="font-italic">only</span> reflected Crescendas’ loss during the period of the Combined Delay in the year 2010 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pre-completion net rental revenue loss).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 We are reinforced in our view by the fact that none of the experts endorsed the Single-Year Model as the more appropriate method on the facts of this case. As mentioned, even Assoc Prof Yu eventually did not take a position as to which model should be used on the present facts. Moreover, we note that in his first expert report, he had computed Crescendas’ loss based on the Multi-Year Model and did not mention the Single-Year Model. He suggested that this was because he had been asked to address the computations of Crescendas’ experts, which were performed using the Multi-Year Model.

</div>
</div> However, this was not a good reason. If he had genuinely believed that the Single-Year Model was a better approach, he should have said so in his first report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 To the extent that the Judge was of the view that both Assoc Prof Yu and Assoc Prof Tay were of the view that the Single-Year Model was a legitimate model (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [104]–[105]), we respectfully say that this was a gloss which gave the impression that they were of the view that the Single-Year Model was a suitable alternative to the Multi-Year Model. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As we mentioned above, Assoc Prof Yu did not quite say that the Single-Year Model was a suitable alternative to the Multi-Year Model.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 More importantly, Assoc Prof Tay’s Fourth Report, which was dated 19 April 2021 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the day on which Assoc Prof Tay gave oral evidence), emphasised that the Multi-Year Model was superior to the Single-Year Model because real estate leases run for multiple years. In that report, he considered the Single-Year Model to be effectively a truncated Multi-Year Model, a point which he repeated in oral evidence. Indeed, as mentioned above at [125(d)], while he orally opined that the Single-Year Model was a legitimate method, he still preferred the Multi-Year Model. This was consistent with Assoc Prof Tay’s Fourth Report. In fact, the Judge was aware that he preferred the Multi-Year Model and the Judge was simply trying to establish that Assoc Prof Tay was not ruling out the Single-Year Model. However, there is a significant difference between saying that the Single-Year Model was a legitimate method and saying that it was not the preferred method. In our view, the real question is which was the better method and the expert evidence was overwhelmingly in favour of the Multi-Year Model.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 This is not the end of the matter. Whilst the expert evidence indicates that the Combined Delay would cause Crescendas to suffer post-completion net rental revenue loss over several years, the Judge identified three main shortcomings of the Multi-Year Model, which, if valid, may mean that the threshold for appellate intervention has not been crossed. Having examined the shortcomings identified by the Judge with the benefit of parties’ submissions on appeal, we respectfully disagree with the Judge’s reasons for not adopting the Multi-Year Model. We will address each reason in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Multi-Year Model is not too speculative</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 One reason the Judge gave for rejecting the Multi-Year Model was that it was too speculative. While some degree of uncertainty was inevitable in the assessment of expectation loss, this was compounded in the Multi-Year Model because it involved projecting occupancy rates, rental rates and net rental revenue margin over several years. The number of years over which the projection was to be made was in turn dependent on the time taken to reach stabilised occupancy. Further, the Multi-Year Model involved a multitude of variables which by themselves were uncertain and subjective, and parties disagreed on each variable, resulting in disparate positions being taken on the final quantum (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [112]–[114]). Even though Crescendas proposed a discount of 8% to take into account the risks of Biopolis 3 not achieving its revenue projections, the Judge found it unsatisfactory as this discount rate, whilst accounting for some uncertainties in revenue projections, failed to account for other uncertainties, including in particular the uncertainty in the time required for Biopolis 3 to achieve stabilised occupancy (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [115] and [305]). The Judge was of the view that the Single-Year Model was a more straightforward method which does not require the court to project variables over several years, and which is dependent on only two main variables – the first-year occupancy rate which Biopolis 3 would have achieved in 2010 if the Combined Delay had not occurred and the monthly rental rate in 2010. The reliance on assumptions and estimations about projected occupancies and rental rates were reduced, and so was the disagreement on the variables (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [126]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Crescendas submitted that as a matter of principle, the difficulty in assessing damages was no reason for not awarding damages where substantial loss had been incurred. The court must do the best that it can in quantifying the loss claimed. Citing <span class="font-italic">MFM</span><span class="font-italic"> Restaurants Pte Ltd and another v Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2011] 1 SLR 150 (“<span class="font-italic">MFM (CA)</span>”) as an example, Crescendas submitted that courts had awarded damages for revenue loss suffered over a period of time following a contractual breach, despite the uncertainty in projecting the expected revenue which could have been earned if there had been no breach.

</div> It also argued that the speculation was magnified by the Judge’s finding that Crescendas did not take all reasonable steps to mitigate its net rental revenue loss (a finding which Crescendas was not challenging on appeal). Given this finding, projected (as opposed to actual) net rental revenue had to be used in the Delay Scenario to determine what Crescendas could have achieved had all reasonable steps been taken to mitigate its loss. This “doubles the speculation required in the [M]ulti-[Y]ear [M]odel” since net rental revenue was also projected in the No-Delay Scenario.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In the light of parties’ submissions, it is appropriate at this juncture to re-visit the law with regard to certainty of proof of damage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 As mentioned, a claimant must satisfy the court as to the fact of damage <span class="font-italic">and </span>its amount to justify an award of substantial damages: <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay </span>at [27].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 If the fact of damage is shown but <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> is given as to its amount such that it is <span class="font-italic">virtually impossible</span> to assess damages, this will generally permit only an award of nominal damages. Such a situation may arise where the nature and effect of the breach render the assessment of damages far too speculative an enterprise for the claimant to adduce evidence of its loss and for the court to quantify the same in any meaningful way: <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Boong Hua and others and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>”) at [225]. <span class="font-italic">Experience Hendrix LLC</span><span class="font-italic"> v PPX Enterprises Inc </span>[2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 830 (“<span class="font-italic">Experience Hendrix</span>”) was one such case. There, in breach of a settlement agreement, the defendant licensed various master recordings by the late artist Jimi Hendrix without his estate’s consent. The claimant, a company effectively owned by the sole beneficiary of Jimi Hendrix’s estate, conceded that it had no evidence, and it could not ever possibly get evidence, to quantify the financial loss it suffered as a result of these breaches (<span class="font-italic">Experience Hendrix </span>at [14]), and Mance LJ accepted that it was a “practical impossibility” to demonstrate “the effect of [the] defendant’s undoubted breaches on the [claimant’s] general programme of promoting their product” (<span class="font-italic">Experience Hendrix </span>at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Outside such situations, where the claimant has “attempted its level best to prove its loss and the evidence is cogent, the court should allow it to recover the damages claimed” [emphasis in original omitted]: <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay </span>at [31]. Indeed, the law does not demand that the claimant prove with complete certainty the exact amount of damage suffered; it only requires the claimant to attempt its level best, as far as the circumstances permit, to put forward cogent evidence of its loss: <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span> at [28] and [31]. This encapsulates the flexible approach the law takes towards proof of damage. Different occasions may call for different evidence with regard to certainty of proof, depending on the circumstances of the case and the nature of the damages claimed. Where precise evidence of the quantum of loss is obtainable, such as where the claim is for expenses already incurred, the court will naturally expect to have such evidence: <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span> at [30]. However, where precision and certainty as to the quantum of loss is impossible due to the circumstances and the nature of the claim, a claimant’s inability to prove the precise amount of loss will not be held against it as long as the claimant has put forward cogent evidence in an attempt to do its level best to prove its loss. In which case, the court will allow the claim and do the best it can to assess the loss suffered by the claimant:<span class="font-italic"> Lim Chong Poon v Chiang Sing </span><span class="font-italic">Jeong </span>[2020] SGCA 27 at [27]; <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span> at [30]–[31]. Where it is clear that substantial loss has been incurred, the fact that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the loss is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages: <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay </span>at [28]. As eloquently put by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MFM (CA)</span> at [62]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [B]earing in mind the fact that <span class="font-italic">d</span><span class="font-italic">amages are not ascertained in an abstract vacuum but must necessarily involve considering many other factors that ought not to be taken into account for the purposes of the assessment of damages but are simultaneously present in the context of the entire factual matrix before the court</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">some educated guesses have to be made</span> – regardless of the precise methodology ultimately adopted by the court. To state this is merely to acknowledge the very real fact that life is far more complex than simple law school hypotheticals and even textbooks would have us believe. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However, that has never prevented the courts from awarding what, in their view, were just and fair sums to plaintiffs if the legal rules and principles justified them.</span> Indeed, as we have acknowledged (realistically) above (at [57]), <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the court will simply do the best that it can</span>, having regard to all the circumstances before it. … [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The case of <span class="font-italic">MFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>is an instance where the claimant and the court did their best in the circumstances to quantify the claimant’s lost profits during the period of the defendants’ breaches (“Breach Period”) and after the period of the defendants’ breaches (“Post-Breach Period”), despite the presence of numerous extraneous factors obscuring the precise quantum of loss attributable to the defendants’ breaches. In that case, Low Theng Yong Dickson (“Dickson”), a former operations manager of a chain of seafood restaurants, “Fish &amp; Co”, allegedly divulged Fish &amp; Co’s confidential information to its rival, The Manhattan Fish Market (“MFM”). Fish &amp; Co, Dickson and MFM thereafter entered into a settlement deed, pursuant to which MFM made various undertakings, including an undertaking to use sauces which were completely different from Fish &amp; Co’s. Five months later, Fish &amp; Co sued MFM and Dickson, claiming that their breaches of the undertakings caused Fish &amp; Co to lose customers and profits during the Breach and Post-Breach Periods. MFM and Dickson consented to a judgment on liability. In the assessment of the quantum of damages, the expert witness on each side proposed different approaches to calculate Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits in the Breach and Post-Breach Periods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In <span class="font-italic">Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd v MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd and another </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1104 (“<span class="font-italic">MFM (HC)</span>”), Belinda Ang J (as she then was) endorsed one of the methods of quantification put forward by Fish &amp; Co (at [51]) and awarded damages for loss of profits using that method in respect of the Breach and Post-Breach Periods notwithstanding evidential issues concerning quantification. As regards Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits claim in the Breach Period, there was uncertainty in the amount of loss attributable to MFM’s and Dickson’s breaches as <span class="font-italic">the loss could be attributable to other factors</span> such as the tight competition in the food and beverage market (at [56]). Nevertheless, having noted the principle that “[t]he court will have to do its best to determine the loss of profits given the available material” (at [52]), Ang J proceeded to find a rational way of assessing lost profits that would alleviate the speculative element of the exercise and discount the influence of factors (at [56]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 As regards Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits claim in the Post-Breach Period, Ang J found that this category of loss was in fact suffered because the cessation of the breach did not necessarily mean the end of Fish &amp; Co’s loss. Some of Fish &amp; Co’s customers would continue to patronise MFM’s outlet after MFM had begun using its own sauces. She characterised this as a “gradual trailing off” of the effect of the breach (<span class="font-italic">MFM (HC)</span> at [63]). Notwithstanding that the trailing off effect was “subject to <span class="font-italic">unknown factors operating in relation to the acts of third parties or other events independent of the defendants’ breach</span>” [emphasis added] and that it was “difficult evidentially to say whether how long and to what extent customers will continue to patronise MFM’s outlet after the defendants had begun using MFM sauces”, Ang J proceeded to award Fish &amp; Co loss of profits for the Post-Breach Period and discounted the eventual award to take into account these uncertainties (<span class="font-italic">MFM (HC) </span>at [63] and [67]–[68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MFM (C</span><span class="font-italic">A)</span> upheld Ang J’s decision to award loss of profits suffered in the Breach and Post-Breach Periods (but used a different method of quantification). The Court of Appeal observed that it was difficult to quantify Fish &amp; Co’s lost profits as a result of MFM’s and Dickson’s breaches because there were numerous factors which could potentially affect the reasons for Fish &amp; Co’s decline in sales (<span class="font-italic">MFM (CA) </span>at [57]). Nonetheless, it proceeded to accept what in its view was a reasonable estimation of the projected percentage change in gross sales to ascertain the projected gross sales Fish &amp; Co would have earned had there been no breach. The award for the Post-Breach Period was also discounted to make allowance for a gradual decrease of the effect of the breaches. All these were done in the light of the court’s duty to do the best it could to compensate Fish &amp; Co for loss which it had in fact sustained (see <span class="font-italic">MFM (CA) </span>at [68]–[69] and [146]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 On the other hand, JP relied on the Canadian case of <span class="font-italic">Grandison v </span><span class="font-italic">NovaGold Resources Inc</span> [2007] BCSC 1780 (“<span class="font-italic">Grandison</span>”) to support its argument that the court should not adopt a method of assessment where too many variables are at play.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  RC(87) at paras 35–38.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> JP submitted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36. Regarding the expert evidence, the petitioners’ expert, Mr Tidball, testified that the fair value was between $6.135 and $8.51 per share. In contrast, the respondents’ expert, Mr Harder, opined that the fair value was between $1.00 to $2.25 per share. Both experts used the discounted cash flow (‘DCF’) method of valuation. The Court noted that the experts agreed that minimal adjustments in any of the material components of a DCF analysis were likely to produce substantial variations in result. Pertinently, the Court stated at [80]: ‘It goes without saying that a DCF valuation is particularly difficult in the case of a company such as Coast Mountain where the project is in the development stages, there is no operating history, the components of revenue and cost are uncertain, and the manner in which and time within which the undertaking is likely to be brought to fruition by is affected by a variety of objective and subjective factors. Mr Harder aptly described it as an exercise in ‘educated speculation’.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37. The Court then listed the significant assumptions made by both experts and noted that they led to extremely different results. The Court eventually declined to apply their DCF valuations as they were ‘rife with speculation and uncertainty’. Instead, the Court held that the appropriate starting point for the determination of value in this case was found to be the transaction itself, with other indices of value then being used to confirm the indicated value or to justify any adjustment to it. This is because market transactions, like the plan of arrangement, are ‘indicators of prices at which parties have been prepared to buy and sell the shares’, and ‘depending on the circumstances, it may be the best evidence of fair value’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 We do not think that <span class="font-italic">Grandison</span> is authority for a general proposition that a court should eschew a method of assessment just because there are many variables. Indeed, as mentioned, the court has embarked on such an assessment in the face of multiple variables.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Turning to the facts of this case, with respect to the Judge, the fact that there will be a wider range of variables when assessing post-completion net rental revenue loss over multiple years, for which differences of opinion exist, is not a good reason by itself for preferring the Single-Year Model.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 First, the Judge’s concerns regarding the speculative nature of the Multi-Year Model are overstated. Crescendas had put forward a copious amount of empirical data relating to Biopolis 3, market data of comparable buildings and island-wide market trends, which collectively provided a foundation upon which multi-year projections of net rental revenue in both the Delay and No-Delay Scenarios could be rationally made. For a detailed overview of the data and evidence before the court, see the <span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [134]–[306]. These, along with market data collected by JP’s expert (Assoc Prof Yu), gave the court sufficient material to make reasoned estimates after sifting through the evidence with care. The experts used different methodologies and different assumptions in arriving at their respective conclusions, but the court was well-placed to resolve any disagreements between the experts by evaluating the relative strength of each expert’s methodology and validating their underlying assumptions with reference to the evidence, as it is often done in other cases. In fact, this was what the Judge did when applying the Multi-Year Model as an alternative. The level of speculation entailed in this endeavour to project Crescendas’ post-completion net rental revenue loss over several years did not rise to the level of rendering it virtually or practically impossible to meaningfully ascertain this loss. We also note in passing that parties agreed on the quantum of certain parameters on appeal, which further reduced the uncertainty involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 JP pointed out that <span class="font-italic">MFM (CA) </span>is a case where the claimant had an established income stream prior to the defendants’ breaches, but Crescendas did not. Having an established track record in the form of past revenue figures may assist the court in so far as it may provide some form of starting point for revenue projections, but the absence of historical data does not necessarily render it impossible for the court to make reasoned estimations. It all depends on whether the claimant has supplied sufficient material that can form the evidential basis on which the court arrives at a reasoned estimate. In our judgment, Crescendas has done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Secondly, and more fundamentally, in rejecting the Multi-Year Model for being speculative and thus denying compensation for post-completion net rental revenue loss, the Judge overlooked the expert evidence which proved the existence of such loss (see above at [146]–[148]). Given the fact of damage, the court should, as a matter of principle, allow the claim for damages and do its best to quantify such loss if the claimant had likewise attempted its level best in placing cogent evidence before the court. In our judgment, Crescendas had discharged this onus and should not be denied recovery of such loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Finally, the Judge’s criticism that the Multi-Year Model was speculative overlooked the point that the speculative aspects of ascertaining quantum flow from the nature of the post-completion net rental revenue loss, and the circumstances in which they were sustained on the facts of this case. Net rental revenue projections in the No-Delay Scenario have to be made on the basis of many parameters over several years. This is compounded by the fact that the parameters are uncertain as they are influenced by market factors. We note that this uncertainty is not unique to the present case. Similar uncertainty arises for many loss of profit claims where the extent of the loss is not based entirely on existing facts, but by reference to projected earnings which are influenced by market conditions. The fact that post-completion net rental revenue loss was sustained in circumstances where there was inadequate mitigation on the part of Crescendas only made a workable Multi-Year Model more difficult but did not render it unworkable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 By rejecting the Multi-Year Model as being too speculative and denying compensation for post-completion net rental revenue loss, the Judge effectively held the nature and circumstances of the loss against Crescendas even when it had done its best in the proof of quantum and there was sufficient material for the court to make a reasoned estimate of such loss. This is unfair, since the uncertainty arises not for want of effort on Crescendas’ part to assist the court in quantification, but is inherent in the quantification process of such loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 For completeness, we note that a discount on the final award can be applied to account for uncertainty in determining the multi-year net rental revenue loss. The Judge found that Crescendas’ proposed discount rate did not adequately account for the uncertainty in the time required for Biopolis 3 to achieve stabilised occupancy in the Multi-Year Model (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [115] and [305]). This is true. However, this is not a valid reason for rejecting the Multi-Year Model. The Judge could have adjusted the discount factor to fairly and reasonably accommodate additional uncertainties, rather than to reject the Multi-Year Model and deny Crescendas compensation in respect of its post-completion net rental revenue loss. As it turned out, the Judge accepted a discount factor of 8% as suggested by Mr Toh but wrongly applied it. We elaborate on this later at [192] below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The Multi-Year Model should not be rejected on the basis that it depended on variables outside the contract-breaker’s control</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The Judge seriously doubted the fairness of the Multi-Year Model in quantifying the loss for which JP can fairly be held liable for, given that it is dependent primarily on variables outside JP’s control and which operate long after the period of delay caused by JP (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [120]). In particular, he found that the parameter of stabilised occupancy, which is critical in the quantification of loss under the Multi-Year Model, does not furnish a “principled basis for quantifying the loss of net rental revenue for which [JP] should be held liable” because JP had no control over Biopolis 3’s stabilised occupancy level. This was entirely dependent on Crescendas’ actions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, marketing and pricing strategies) and could be anywhere between 0% to 100%. Biopolis 3’s occupancy levels in the years following the Combined Delay were also beyond JP’s control (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [116]–[118]). Even if using parameters aligned with market expectations could fairly and reasonably estimate what Crescendas would have achieved, the fact remained that JP did not have control over Biopolis 3’s rental rates and occupancy rates, amongst other parameters, in the years subsequent to the Combined Delay (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [119]–[120]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 On appeal, Crescendas contended that the use of parameters outside of JP’s control was not a valid reason to reject the Multi-Year Model, because the extent of a contract-breaker’s control could not be a limiting factor to the recovery of damages.

</div> In turn, JP submitted that the Judge did not make such a “blanket ruling” that a contract-breaker’s lack of control is a limiting factor to the recovery of damages, but simply found that the evidence did not show that JP was liable for the extent of loss claimed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As a preliminary point, we disagree with JP’s attempt to characterise the Judge’s decision as a ruling directed towards whether the <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> shows that JP <span class="font-italic">is</span> liable for the extent of loss claimed. Quite clearly, the Judge was directing his mind to the issue of whether JP <span class="font-italic">should</span> as a matter of fairness be held liable for net rental revenue loss quantified under the Multi-Year Model, where the method of quantification relies on variables lying entirely outside JP’s control.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 We accept that JP has no control over parameters such as the stabilised occupancy level and rental rates employed in the Multi-Year Model. However, we respectfully disagree with the Judge that this reason justifies the rejection of the Multi-Year Model. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 It must first be appreciated that the Multi-Year Model is a means to reflect the multi-year net rental revenue loss suffered by Crescendas as a result of the Combined Delay. Given that the loss pertains to <span class="font-italic">Crescendas</span><span class="font-italic">’</span> net rental revenue, the extent of the loss suffered would naturally be contingent on Crescendas’ own actions in relation to its leasing business. The fact that this loss concerns <span class="font-italic">net rental revenue</span>, a head of loss which is dependent on custom from potential tenants, also necessarily means that the extent of loss is dependent on variable market conditions which influence the actions of third-party tenants. It is due to the nature of the loss and the circumstances in which it arises that the Multi-Year Model has to rely on parameters which are influenced by variables beyond JP’s control. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The fact that the quantum of contractual loss is influenced by variables beyond the contract-breaker’s control does not by itself preclude recovery. It is quite often the case that the extent of a claimant’s loss is beyond the control of a contract-breaker. However, the latter is not at the mercy of the claimant as the claimant has to prove the quantum of loss and that he had taken reasonable steps to mitigate his loss, where applicable. The concept of remoteness also applies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 This point is illustrated by the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MFM (HC)</span> and <span class="font-italic">MFM (CA)</span> respectively to allow an award for damages in respect of Fish &amp; Co’s lost profits sustained in the Post-Breach Period, even though such loss was “subject to unknown factors operating in relation to the acts of third parties or other events independent of the defendants’ breaches” (<span class="font-italic">MFM (HC)</span> at [67]) and “numerous factors [could] potentially affect the … reasons for Fish &amp; Co’s decline in sales” (<span class="font-italic">MFM (CA)</span> at [57]). Instead of analysing the recoverability of this head of loss based on the control MFM and Dickson had over the quantum of loss Fish &amp; Co suffered, the High Court and the Court of Appeal applied the principle of remoteness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The Multi-Year Model does not lead to “illogical” or “inequitable” outcomes</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Finally, the Judge was concerned that the Multi-Year Model could potentially yield illogical and inequitable outcomes (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [122]). As the Multi-Year Model quantified the loss suffered by the plaintiff based on subtracting the net rental revenue earned in the Delay Scenario (“<span class="font-italic">x</span>”) from the net rental revenue earned in the No-Delay Scenario (“<span class="font-italic">y</span>”), it was conceptually possible for the difference between the two figures to yield a negative figure (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [121]). He gave two hypotheticals where the (<span class="font-italic">y</span>–<span class="font-italic">x</span>) figure could be negative:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first hypothetical involved a building contractor who caused a one-year delay in the completion of a building, from January 2020 (the contractual completion date) to January 2021 (the actual completion date). In a Delay Scenario, if the demand for unit space in the building was highly exuberant and the marketing and pricing strategy was attractive to the tenants, stabilised occupancy of 90% could possibly be reached in the very first year of the building’s operation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by the end of 2021). In a No-Delay Scenario, assuming the marketing and pricing strategy was unattractive to the tenants, the building might take four years to reach stabilised occupancy of 90% in 2024. Therefore, the net rental revenue for such a Delay Scenario would be higher than the net rental revenue in such a No-Delay Scenario. This would mean that the developer suffered no loss. The Judge was of the view that such an outcome “is illogical in principle because it suggests that the contractor is not liable for <span class="font-italic">any</span> loss of net rental revenue” [emphasis in original], when the contractor had undoubtedly caused the developer to suffer a loss of net rental revenue for the year of delay itself (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 2020) (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [122]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second hypothetical involved an industrious property developer who made special efforts during the period of delay to actively promote the building to counteract the impact of the delay, eventually resulting in an even higher occupancy rate and hence higher net rental revenue in the Delay Scenario. The Judge was of the view that “this would penalise the industrious property developer for trying to make the best out of a bad situation”, and was of the view that this outcome “yielded by the [M]ulti-[Y]ear [M]odel [would] … run counter to the principle that the innocent party should take all reasonable steps to mitigate its loss” (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [123]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Judge then drew a comparison with the Single-Year Model, which avoided the possibility of illogical and inequitable outcomes because it focused strictly on the loss caused to Crescendas in the year of delay, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 2010, and would therefore always yield a positive figure (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [127]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The Judge noted that the facts of this case would yield a positive figure for the difference between (<span class="font-italic">y</span>–<span class="font-italic">x</span>) but took the view that as a matter of principle, the possibility of such illogical and inequitable outcomes undermined the robustness of the Multi-Year Model as a fair and equitable measure of Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [124]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 We respectfully disagree with the Judge that these two hypotheticals show that the Multi-Year Model should not be adopted. The outcomes in these hypotheticals are a result of the application of settled legal principles and are not attributable to any particular defect in the method of quantification employed by the Multi-Year Model. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Indeed, it is consistent with the compensatory principle not to award damages in the first hypothetical scenario. Pursuant to the compensatory principle, damages are meant to place the party who sustains loss by reason of a breach, in the same situation as if the contract had been performed: <span class="font-italic">Robinson </span>at 855. In determining whether loss has been suffered, the promisee’s “<span class="font-italic">overall</span> position is taken into account” [emphasis added] (Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span><span class="font-italic"> on the Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Treitel</span>”) at para 20-006). If it is ascertained that the breach has not affected the promisee’s position, then he cannot claim substantial damages: <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span> at para 20-008. Hence, <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span> at para 20-008 states:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… This aspect of the [compensatory] principle is most readily illustrated by the case in which a seller of goods wrongfully fails to deliver on a falling market. If the buyer has not paid and if, at the time fixed for delivery, he can buy substitute goods more cheaply elsewhere, the breach will prima facie have had no adverse effect on him, so that he will not be entitled to substantial damages. Similarly, <span class="font-italic">a shipowner cannot get substantial damages for breach of the charterer’s obligation to load if he finds alternative and more profitable employment for the ship</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The potential for loss arises upon the occurrence of the delay in the first hypothetical scenario. But this in itself would not justify compensation. There must be actual loss. If “highly exuberant” demand for unit space following the delay fortuitously enabled the developer to earn more rental revenue<span class="font-italic"> overall</span> than if there had been no delay, no actual loss would have been suffered. This outcome, in the Judge’s view, is unsatisfactory because the contractor had undoubtedly caused the developer loss in the year of the delay itself. However, as a matter of principle, the court must have regard to <span class="font-italic">both </span>the absence of rent in the first year <span class="font-italic">and</span> the gains in the subsequent years. This is an outcome that flows from the application of the compensatory principle, which requires the claimant’s overall position in the breach and hypothetical no-breach positions to be taken into account, rather than any particular quirk in the Multi-Year Model.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Indeed, the legal position would remain the same even if the Single-Year Model were used. The fallacy in the Judge’s approach is that he had assumed that it was correct as a matter of principle to exclude the earnings in the subsequent years just because the Single-Year Model was used. On the contrary, a court would still have to consider the claimant’s overall position, as mentioned above, even for the Single-Year Model. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 In the second hypothetical scenario, the industrious property developer would not be awarded damages, in the light of the rule that “the aggrieved party who goes beyond what the law requires of it and avoids incurring any loss at all will not be entitled to recover any damages”, as stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Asia Star”</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [24]. The Judge took the view that this is an inequitable outcome as it penalises the industrious property developer and goes against the principle that the innocent party should take all reasonable steps to mitigate its loss. Again, this criticism is more properly directed towards the state of the law as opposed to the Multi-Year Model <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Sub-conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 We therefore conclude that the Judge erred in rejecting the Multi-Year Model. The Multi-Year Model should be used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Two further steps need to be taken to quantify Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue: (a) the application of a discount factor to account for uncertainties in quantification, and (b) the apportionment of loss to reflect JP’s liability. These two issues will be explored in the following sections, which we now turn to.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-issue 2: ascertaining the applicable discount rate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In these Appeals, the parties agreed with Mr Toh’s proposed method for discounting Crescendas’ net rental revenue loss. This method involves applying an 8% discount rate on a <span class="font-italic">compounded</span> basis to the difference in net rental revenue between the Delay and No-Delay Scenarios for a particular year, before summing up the discounted difference in each year from January 2010 to January 2015. We agree with the parties that this approach should be used, instead of the <span class="font-italic">simple</span> 8% discount rate which the Judge applied to the overall difference in net rental revenue from January 2010 to January 2015 (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [308]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-issue 3: apportioning the loss to reflect JP’s share of the Combined Delay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 After computing the total net rental revenue loss under the Multi-Year Model and applying the 8% discount rate, the Judge held that the resulting value should be apportioned based on 161 out of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">334 days</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>to reflect JP’s liability (<span class="font-italic">Damages </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> <span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>at [81]–[82] and [319]).

Furthermore, as we have found (contrary to the Judge’s findings) that the Combined Delay did not cause the loss of PetNet as a tenant, there are consequential adjustments to be made. At our request, parties provided calculations for a situation where the Multi-Year Model was applied subject to the Two Adjustments and an adjustment for the fact that the Combined Delay did not cause the loss of PetNet as a tenant.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 The Judge held that loss in respect of the Holding Costs was caused directly by the delay. Reliance was placed on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Alvin Nicholas Nathan v Raffles Assets (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1056 (“<span class="font-italic">Alvin Nicholas Nathan</span>”). There, the Court of Appeal held that reliance loss is “the costs and expenses the claimant incurred in reliance on the defendant’s contracted-for performance, but which were wasted because of the breach of contract”. The award for reliance loss is based on “the assumption that were the contract performed, the claimant would have at least fully recovered the costs and expenditure incurred” (<span class="font-italic">Alvin Nicholas Nathan </span>at [24]). On the facts, the Judge found that the Holding Costs incurred by Crescendas fell squarely within this description. He found that Crescendas had committed to paying annual land rent to JTC Corporation in the building agreement for Biopolis 3 after the LOI was signed. If the delay in completion had not occurred, Crescendas would have begun earning rental revenue from January 2010 onwards and any rental revenue which would have been earned from January 2010 would have offset the Holding Costs incurred by Crescendas. However, as a result of the delay, Crescendas’ payments in respect of the Holding Costs were wasted (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [327]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200  The Judge also held that the Holding Costs were not too remote and would have fallen within both limbs of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>, as these costs flowed naturally from the delay, were common industry knowledge, and had been brought to JP’s attention in the course of discussions (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [332]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 Further, the Judge found that since Crescendas’ claim for expectation loss was for <span class="font-italic">net</span> rental revenue, allowing it to recover the Holding Costs as reliance loss would not have been a case of double-claiming (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [339]–[340]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 However, the Judge noted that with or without the Combined Delay, Crescendas would have granted rent-free periods to its tenants at the start of their tenancies, so as to allow them to complete the necessary fitting-out works in the rented space (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC) </span>at [206]). He held that Holding Costs incurred during what would have been the rent-free fitting-out period, set at an average of three months (90 days), should not be claimable by Crescendas because they were not wasted expenditure caused<span class="font-italic"> </span>by the Combined Delay (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span> at [341]–[342]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 As the Holding Costs of $2,340,102.37 were incurred in respect of a period of 355 days, the Judge pro-rated it to $2,201,673.78 to reflect the sum incurred during the 334 days of Combined Delay. This was further pro-rated to $1,608,408.39 to reflect Holding Costs incurred during the 244 rent-paying days and leaving out Holding Costs incurred during the 90-day rent-free period. Of the $1,608,408.39, JP was only held liable for $775,310.63 as it was responsible only for 161 days of delay (<span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC) </span>at [343]–[345]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Crescendas challenged the Judge’s decision to exclude the Holding Costs incurred during the rent-free period. Crescendas emphasised that awarding damages for the Holding Costs incurred during the rent-free period would not impinge on the compensatory principle. So long as it would have been able to earn rental revenue equivalent to or in excess of the wasted expenditure over the period of the Combined Delay, it should be compensated for the full amount of the wasted expenditure. Here, as it was undisputed that Crescendas would have recovered more than the total Holding Costs if there had been no Combined Delay, the full Holding Costs should be awarded as reliance loss without any allowance made for the rent-free period.

It submitted that Crescendas’ failure to recoup Holding Costs during this period was not the result of the Combined Delay but Crescendas’ own decision to grant rent-free periods to its tenants.

First, to avoid double compensation, the law precludes a claimant from recovering <span class="font-italic">gross</span> profits it has lost as a result of the breach, alongside expenditure wasted as a result of the breach. A claimant usually has to elect between the two. Otherwise, there would be double compensation. However, double compensation is avoided when the lost profits are claimed on a <span class="font-italic">net basis</span>, in which case the claimant can claim damages for <span class="font-italic">both </span>his wasted expenditure and loss of <span class="font-italic">net </span>profits (<span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span> at [52]–[54], citing <span class="font-italic">Alvin Nicholas Nathan</span> at [24]–[25]). This concept can be explained with reference to the illustration given by <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span> at [56]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A hypothetical scenario aptly demonstrates this. In the hypothetical, an entity owns a shop. The cost of the entity’s permanent staff and its rental is $8 per month. For expending the fixed expenses of $8 a month, the entity makes $10 per month in total revenue, thereby earning a monthly net profit of $2. If, due to another entity’s breach (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, defective works), the entity is unable to open its shop for a month, the entity would still have to expend $8 a month in paying its permanent staff and rental, as such expenses are fixed expenses which do not depend on whether the shop is opened or not. This $8 would be wasted fixed expenditure, as the entity would not be able to generate any revenue while its shop is closed due to the other entity’s defective works. If the entity is only allowed to claim for its loss of net profit in this case, the entity’s claim would be $2, which would not even cover the entity’s wasted fixed expenditure of $8. Hence, to ensure that the entity is put in the same position as it would have been but for the breach, the damages due to the entity ought to be $10, being the sum of the entity’s net profits and wasted fixed expenditure. This $10 would be used to offset the entity’s wasted fixed expenditure of $8, leaving the entity with the $2 net profit which it would have earned but for the other entity’s breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the above illustration, the gross profit of $10 would have covered the wasted expenditure of $8, leaving a remainder of $2 as net profit. If the entity is allowed to claim both its loss of gross profit of $10 and wasted expenditure of $8, it would be awarded $18 in damages. This would result in over-compensation because the gross profit of $10, when broken down, already includes the wasted expenditure of $8 and a remaining portion consisting of net profit of $2. However, if the entity is allowed to claim its net profit of $2 and its wasted expenditure of $8, there is no overlap between the two heads of damage and the entity is only awarded $10 in damages, which nicely places the entity in a position as if there had been no breach. Here, Crescendas was not making a claim in respect of <span class="font-italic">gross</span> rental revenue it would have earned and the wasted expenditure in the form of Holding Costs at the same time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Secondly, it must be borne in mind that there is a distinction between saying that Crescendas would have <span class="font-italic">incurred expenses</span> in respect of Holding Costs regardless of whether there was a Combined Delay and saying that Crescendas’ expenses in respect of the Holding Costs would have been <span class="font-italic">wasted</span> regardless of whether there was a Combined Delay. The former concerns Crescendas’ payment of the Holding Costs. The concept of reliance loss is concerned with the latter situation, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Crescendas’ ability to <span class="font-italic">recoup</span> the payments it made in respect of Holding Costs using the gross rental revenue it would have earned. Where payments made in respect of Holding Costs cannot be recouped, Crescendas’ expenditure on Holding Costs would be “wasted” (see <span class="font-italic">Alvin Nicholas Nathan </span>at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 In our view, bearing in mind the compensatory principle, Crescendas is entitled to claim Holding Costs incurred during the 90-day rent-free period. During the 334 days of Combined Delay, Crescendas was unable to recoup any part of the Holding Costs incurred because it was unable to carry out its leasing business. Had there been no Combined Delay during this same 334-day period, it was common ground that Crescendas would have earned enough <span class="font-italic">gross</span> rental revenue to recoup the Holding Costs incurred in these 334 days <span class="font-italic">and</span> have excess sums in the form of <span class="font-italic">net</span> rental revenue. In particular, Holding Costs incurred during the 90-day rent-free period would have been recouped from gross rental revenue earned in the remaining 244 rent-paying days. Thus, contrary to the Judge’s finding and JP’s argument, the failure to recoup Holding Costs incurred during the 90-day rent-free period was attributable to the Combined Delay. Accordingly, to place Crescendas in a position as if the Combined Delay did not occur, Crescendas should be awarded the <span class="font-italic">gross</span> rental revenue it would have otherwise earned during the 334 days of Combined Delay. This would be an aggregate of the net rental revenue which would have been earned and the Holding Costs incurred during these 334 days (inclusive of the 90 rent-free days).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Crescendas had claimed for <span class="font-italic">net</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>rental revenue. When computing this, it had deducted Holding Costs<span class="font-italic"> </span>incurred during the 334 days of Combined Delay<span class="font-italic"> </span>from the gross rental revenue it would have earned during this same period. Accordingly, to compensate Crescendas in full, Holding Costs incurred during the 334 days of Combined Delay, inclusive of the 90-day rent-free periods, must be added back.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 In any event, it must not be forgotten that the Judge was of the view that Crescendas could <span class="font-italic">in principle</span> claim both the Holding Costs and net rental revenue loss incurred during the Combined Delay. In other words, he found that Crescendas was entitled to “add back” the Holding Costs to its net rental revenue. JP did not challenge the Judge’s finding. It was only the period for the Holding Costs to be added back that was in dispute. Crescendas claimed 334 days whereas JP agreed with the Judge that only 244 days should be added back. However, the underlying premise as to why Holding Costs had to be added back in the first place was that Crescendas had deducted Holding Costs from gross rental revenue when it claimed net rental revenue, as explained above. Thus, it was not open to JP to argue that Holding Costs incurred during the 90-day rent-free period were not claimable in principle because they would have been wasted in any event. The shoe is on the other foot. Since Crescendas is entitled in principle to claim Holding Costs in addition to the net rent, there is no reason to confine it to 244 days instead of 334 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 We observe that this issue of whether 244 or 334 days of Holding Costs could be claimed would have been irrelevant if Crescendas had simply claimed gross rental revenue in the first place. There would then have been no need to deduct and then add back the Holding Costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 It will be appreciated that so far we have discussed whether the Holding Costs for 334 days or 244 days should be added back to Crescendas’ claim in respect of loss sustained <span class="font-italic">during</span> the Combined Delay. We did pause to consider whether Crescendas was also entitled to claim Holding Costs for the four years after the Combined Delay. However, since Crescendas did not make such a claim, we say no more about it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 For the above reasons, we overturn the Judge’s decision to exclude the Holding Costs incurred during the 90-day rent-free period. We note that the Holding Costs of $2,340,102.37 were incurred over 355 days, which consists of 334 days of Combined Delay as well as 21 days of waiting for the TOP to be granted. It is common ground that of these 355 days, Crescendas can only claim for the amount incurred during the 334 days of Combined Delay; of these 334 days, only 161 days were attributable to JP. Thus, Holding Costs of $2,340,102.37 have to be apportioned based on 161 out of 355 days. This amounts to $1,061,285.86. We therefore find JP liable for a sum of $1,061,285.86 instead of $775,310.63 as found by the Judge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CA 128</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 When the <span class="font-italic">Damages Judgment (HC)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was released on 10 August 2021, there were three outstanding issues before the Judge in the Suit: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the pre-judgment interest in respect of: (a) Crescendas’ claim for a refund of the additional preliminaries which the parties had agreed to fix at $2.75m; and (b) JP’s counterclaim of $2.5m for unpaid shared savings (“the Shared Savings”) which had been allowed (and is not the subject of any appeal);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the costs in respect of the first tranche of the trial; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the costs in respect of the second tranche of the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 After parties filed written submissions, the Judge rendered his decision, holding: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That pre-judgment interest in respect of Crescendas’ claim for the additional preliminaries was to be fixed at 5.33% per annum and to commence on 15 May 2015 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the writ); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That pre-judgment interest in respect of JP’s counterclaim for the Shared Savings was to be fixed at 5.33% per annum, to commence on 15 May 2015 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the writ); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) That costs in the first tranche were to be awarded to JP at 70% as it had substantially succeeded in the first tranche; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) That costs in the second tranche were to be awarded to JP at 80% as Crescendas’ claims had been “extremely excessive and it [was] remote”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 On 22 December 2021, Crescendas filed CA 128 appealing against the Judge’s decision in respect of the following: (a) his finding that the pre-judgment interest in respect of the Shared Savings was to commence from the date of Crescendas’ writ, as well as (b) the costs awarded to JP for both the first and second tranches of the trial.

</div> Secondly, as JP had only pursued the Shared Savings in its counterclaim, there was no serious or real intention to recover the monies and there was therefore no loss of use of the counterclaimed monies for the period before its counterclaim was filed.

Further, JP submitted that Crescendas was incorrect in arguing that pre-judgment interest for the Shared Savings should run from 20 November 2015 (the date of the counterclaim) for two reasons. First, Crescendas’ submission disregarded the fact that the Shared Savings should have been paid to JP from as early as 12 December 2013, and payment of the same was wrongfully withheld by Crescendas since then. In this connection, JP asserted that the Judge had been fair to have ordered the pre-judgment interest to run from 15 May 2015 rather than from an earlier time.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 In our view, the Judge’s decision to commence the pre-judgment interest from the date of the writ was neither plainly wrong nor unprincipled since the Shared Savings should have been paid even before the writ was filed. First, Crescendas did not dispute the fact that while the writ was filed on 15 May 2015, it was only served on JP on 4 September 2015. This meant that JP’s counterclaim was filed about two months after it was notified of the Suit. Second, under s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed), the court has a wide discretion to grant interest for any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment. In <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay </span>at [100]–[103] the Court of Appeal held that, in general, interest awarded should run from the date of accrual of loss, although where there was an unjustifiable delay on the part of the claimant to bring his action the court may choose to award interest from a later date. On the facts, the Judge could have justifiably ordered the interest to run from the date the debt arose (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 12 December 2013).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Accordingly, we dismiss Crescendas’ appeal in CA 128 as regards the pre-judgment interest on the Shared Savings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 As discussed, we allow CA 87 in part, in so far as the use of the Multi-Year Model (subject to the Two Adjustments), the issue of remoteness and Holding Costs are concerned. We also allow CA 88 in part, on the point that the Combined Delay did not cause the loss of PetNet as a tenant. Accordingly, we allow Crescendas’ claim for net rental revenue loss assessed at $4,185,802.60, instead of $1,789,398.82 as held by the Judge. We also allow Crescendas to claim $1,061,285.86 in Holding Costs from JP instead of $775,310.63 as awarded by the Judge. Parties have challenged some aspects of the Judge’s application of the Single-Year Model in CA 87 and CA 88, but it is unnecessary to deal with these issues since we have decided against using the Single-Year Model.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 We dismiss CA 128 in so far as the issue of pre-judgment interest is concerned. For the avoidance of doubt, we set aside the costs orders of the Judge in respect of the first and second tranches of the trial in the light of our substantive decisions mentioned at [221] above. Therefore, the remaining issue in CA 128 concerning such costs has become academic as an appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 We will address the question of costs separately.

However, completion was delayed by 334 days (the “Combined Delay”), of which Crescendas was responsible for an aggregate of 173 days, and JP was responsible for 161 days. As such, Crescendas claimed three heads of loss against JP: (a) “loss of chance” to earn net rental revenue, (b) holding costs incurred by Crescendas and (c) site staff costs incurred by Crescendas. JP disputed the quantum and recoverability of the former two heads of loss but accepted its liability for $132,157.12 of site staff costs.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The Judge held that both parties’ delays were effective causes of Crescendas’ loss, and that the Combined Delay caused Crescendas to lose five pre-commitment tenants, including PetNet Solutions Pte Ltd (“PetNet”) and Philip Morris Products SA (“Philip Morris”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 As regards Crescendas’ claim for its “loss of chance” to earn net rental revenue, the Judge characterised this as a claim for “loss of net rental revenue”, which consisted of two distinct categories: (a) loss of net rental revenue during the period of the Combined Delay and (b) loss of net rental revenue after the completion of Biopolis 3 (“post-completion net rental revenue loss”). The Judge held that the former was not too remote but that the latter was too remote to be recoverable. In quantifying Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue, the Judge adopted the “Single-Year Model” which only calculated Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue in the year 2010, as opposed to the “Multi-Year Model” which computed Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue over multiple years stretching from the period of the Combined Delay to the years after. On this premise, the Judge found that JP was liable for a sum of $1,789,398.82 in respect of Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Judge held that Crescendas could recover damages for holding costs incurred during the Combined Delay, but pro-rated it to exclude the holding costs incurred during the rent-free fitting-out period which Crescendas would have granted its tenants even if Biopolis 3 had been completed on time. He thus found JP liable for $775,310.63 for this head of loss.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 On appeal, amongst other matters, JP argued that the Judge’s decision on causation was wrong, while Crescendas argued that the Judge erred in his findings on remoteness and quantification regarding its claim for “loss of chance” to earn net rental revenue, as well as in his decision to deny recovery for holding costs incurred during the rent-free fitting-out period.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Notwithstanding Crescendas’ use of the phrase “loss of chance”, the Judge had correctly recognised that Crescendas’ claim was in substance a claim for loss of net rental revenue and not a claim for loss of chance to earn net rental revenue (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]–[46]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The delay attributable to each party was each an independent and effective cause of Crescendas’ loss. Though the Combined Delay caused Crescendas to lose Philip Morris as a tenant, it did not cause the loss of PetNet as a tenant. It followed that JP was not liable to Crescendas for any loss of rent from PetNet (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">48]–[85]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 On the issue of remoteness, Crescendas was allowed to argue on appeal that its post-completion net rental revenue loss constituted ordinary damage notwithstanding its contrary argument before the Judge. On the merits, Crescendas’ entire claim for loss of net rental revenue satisfied the test for remoteness of damages (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]–[109]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 In relation to the quantification of the loss of net rental revenue, the Judge erred in rejecting the Multi-Year Model. The Multi-Year Model should be used. The expert evidence supported a finding that the Combined Delay had resulted in post-completion net rental revenue loss over multiple years and that such loss would result even if Crescendas had taken reasonable efforts to mitigate its loss. The key reason for this was that Biopolis 3 was a multi-tenanted development which would take several years to fill up. This, coupled with the fact that Crescendas’ income stream arose from multi-year leases with tenants in Biopolis 3, meant that the Combined Delay had impacted Crescendas’ net rental revenue stream over several years. Further, the Judge’s reasons for rejecting the Multi-Year Model were not justified (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">10]–[190]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The Judge had calculated the loss of net rental revenue based on the Multi-Year Model, as an alternative to the Single-Year Model. The parties agreed with the Judge’s calculations under the Multi-Year Model, subject to two adjustments. Consequential amendments also had to be made given that, contrary to the Judge’s holding, the Combined Delay did not cause the loss of PetNet as a tenant. On these premises, JP was liable for $4,185,802.60 in respect of Crescendas’ loss of net rental revenue, instead of $1,789,398.82 as held by the Judge (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[19</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]–[197]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Finally, contrary to the Judge’s finding, Crescendas was entitled to claim the holding costs it incurred during the rent-free fitting-out period. As such, JP was liable to Crescendas for $1,061,285.86 in holding costs, instead of $775,310.63 (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">198]–[212]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
