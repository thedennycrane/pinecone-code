These proceedings which involve an international commercial transaction have now been transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In the first application, Summons No 3128 of 2016 (“the Variation Application”), Qilin seeks a variation of the terms of the Injunction to allow the Second Defendant to sell 2,860,000 shares in Millennium Pacific Group Holdings Limited (“Millennium”). In the second application, Summons No 2398 of 2016 (“the Fortification Application”), Qilin applies for the Plaintiff (“CPIT”) to provide fortification of its undertaking to the Court in relation to any damages that Qilin might suffer and the court might order as a result of the Consent Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 There is an issue in these proceedings as to whether the First Defendant, a Hong Kong company, or the Second Defendant, a British Virgin Islands company, is the relevant party. They both have the same name. I shall also refer to the relevant party as “Qilin”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 CPIT and Qilin entered into two related agreements dated 16 November 2015 under which CPIT provided 25,000,000 Millennium shares as collateral for a non-recourse loan from Qilin of HK$31,250,000. Those two agreements were a Stock Secured Financing Agreement made between CPIT and Qilin (“the Loan Agreement”) and a Control Agreement made between CPIT, Qilin and Prominence Financials Limited (“the Control Agreement”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The loan was disbursed on 2 December 2015 and CPIT transferred the shares. CPIT contends that Qilin then unlawfully transferred and/or sold and/or disposed of those shares and that, as a result, CPIT terminated the two agreements on 4 January 2016. Qilin contends that it was entitled to deal with the shares as it did and that, in any event, because CPIT failed to cure an Event of Default, it became the full legal and beneficial owner of the shares with effect from 22 December 2015. The main issue in these proceedings therefore relates to Qilin’s entitlement to deal with the shares during the term of the two agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 These proceedings were commenced in the High Court on 12 January 2016. On the same date CPIT applied for an injunction prohibiting Qilin from disposing of the unsold shares and the proceeds of sale of any shares which had been sold (Summons No 164 of 2016). On 13 January 2016, CPIT applied for a worldwide Mareva injunction against Qilin up to the total value of HK$31,250,000 (Summons No 170 of 2016).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 13 January 2016, the court fixed the hearing date for the applications as 15 January 2016, before Kan Ting Chiu J and on 14 January 2016, notice of the hearing date was given to Qilin, together with copies of the applications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 At the hearing at 10:00am on 15 January 2016, Qilin's solicitors, RHT Law Taylor Wessing LLP (“RHT”) sought an adjournment of the hearing for the applications to be dealt with on an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> basis. The hearing was adjourned until 5:00pm while Qilin considered whether it would give an undertaking pending the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing. In the event, an acceptable undertaking was not offered and the hearing was adjourned to 18 January 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At 10:00am on 18 January 2016, after hearing argument from counsel for CPIT and Qilin, the Court granted the Injunction in the following relevant terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">UPON THE </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">EX PARTE</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline"> APPLICATION</span> of [CPIT] by way of HC/Summons No. 164/2016 filed on 12 January 2016, and UPON READING the 1st Affidavit of Chan Kwong Chi Vicky filed on 12 January 2016 and the 1st Affidavit of Lee Kai Ming filed on 14 January 2016 on behalf of the [CPIT], and <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">UPON HEARING</span> Counsel for [CPIT] and Counsel for [Qilin] on a contested ex parte basis on 15 January 2016 and 18 January 2016, and subject to [CPIT’s] undertaking to abide by any order the Court or a Judge may make as to damages in case the Court or a Judge should hereafter be of opinion that [Qilin] shall have sustained any by reason of this order which the Plaintiff ought to pay, it is ordered that:- </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

C083103 maintained by Prominence Financials Ltd in Hong Kong in [CPIT’s] name on or around 24 November 2015 (the "Pledged Shares") until the trial of or determination of this action or until further order;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.

As a result, the 2,860,000 shares became the subject of prayer 1 of the Injunction and the proceeds became the subject of prayer 2 of the Injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 When the Mareva injunction application came before the court on 18 January 2016 it was adjourned until later in the afternoon for Qilin to consider whether it would offer an acceptable undertaking. As an acceptable undertaking was not then offered, the Court, after hearing argument from counsel for the parties, heard and dismissed the Mareva injunction application. CPIT filed a request for further arguments which was refused. CPIT then filed an application for leave to appeal which was heard on 28 January 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 At that hearing on 28 January 2016 RHT indicated that Qilin was prepared to provide security for CPIT’s claim in the sum of HK$31,250,000 and, in light of that proposal, the hearing was adjourned to 5 February 2016. Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC, the solicitors for CPIT (“MLS”) and RHT then exchanged correspondence. This led to an agreement which was recorded in the Consent Order on 12 February 2016 (Summons No 387 of 2016) and the earlier Order in relation to the Mareva injunction application was rescinded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The relevant terms of the Consent Order are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">UPON THE APPLICATION</span> made by [CPIT] by way of HC/Summons No. 387/2016 coming on for hearing on 28 January 2016, 5 February 2016 and 12 February 2016, <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">AND UPON HEARING</span> Counsel for [CPIT] and Counsel for [Qilin] and <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">UPON THE UNDERTAKING</span> of [CPIT] that, if the Court later finds that [Qilin’s] provision of security pursuant to this Order has caused loss to [Qilin], and decides that [Qilin] should be compensated for that loss, [CPIT] shall comply with any order the Court may make, <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">BY CONSENT</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is ordered that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

He also says that the drastic fall in share price of the shares has meant that CPIT’s sole or primary asset had been tremendously depleted. On this basis Qilin seeks fortification of CPIT’s undertaking under the Consent Order in the sums of US$509,678.35 and HK$2,343,750.00.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Mr Nandakumar refers to the Singapore High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">CHS CPO GmbH (in bankruptcy) and another v Vikas Goel</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 202 (“<span class="font-italic">CHS</span>”) in which Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC (as he then was) set out the legal principles applicable to a fortification application. Ms Wendy Tan, who appears with Mr Kenneth Chua on behalf of CPIT, agrees that this decision sets out the relevant principles on an application for fortification of an undertaking. In summary, Mr Nandakumar submits that an applicant must show a real risk of loss which is governed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, by the contractual principles relating to causation, remoteness of damage and mitigation. In addition, the court has to ascertain whether there are sufficient assets within or outside the jurisdiction that would be readily available to satisfy any liability under the undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Mr Nandakumar submits that there is a real risk of loss in this case. He refers to the exhibits to Man Yun Wah’s (“Mr Man”) 3rd Affidavit and says that Qilin has suffered losses arising from (a) interest paid on funds borrowed for two funding deals in the sum of US$509,678.35 and (b) losses arising from revenue of HK$2,343,750 which has been foregone because Qilin was precluded from utilizing the funds frozen by the injunction to enter into another loan agreement on the same terms of the Loan Agreement. He also states that, if not for the injunction, Qilin would have sold the remaining Millennium shares, at HK$1.25 per share, for a total of HK$3,575,000 but as the value is now only HK$0.22 per share, they are only worth HK$629,200 so that Qilin will have suffered a loss of HK$2,945,800.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 He refers to the passage in <span class="font-italic">CHS</span> at [15] where it was properly emphasized that it is the risk of loss arising from the relevant injunction and not the loss claimed in the proceedings. If there is sufficient risk of loss, then Mr Nandakumar relies on <span class="font-italic">CHS</span> at [38] to [39] which indicate that the applicant has only to demonstrate that there is “an at least reasonable basis for legal liability”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Mr Nandakumar submits that the usual principles of causation and remoteness are satisfied in relation to the loss. He refers to the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JSC Mezhdunarodniy Promyshlenniy Bank v Pugachev</span> [2016] 1 WLR 160 (“<span class="font-italic">Pugachev</span>”) where an order for fortification was quashed on the basis that there was no evidential basis for the conclusion that the defendant was likely to suffer loss as a result of the injunction. In particular he relies on the judgment of Lewison LJ at [99] in relation to the evidence necessary to justify an application for fortification and to the passage in the judgment of Floyd J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury International Limited v Holyoake</span> [2010] EWHC 1150 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Holyoake</span>”) at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Ms Tan submits that Qilin cannot seek to fortify the undertaking which was part of the Consent Order. She submits that where a consent order records an agreement between the parties, it can only be set aside on grounds which would justify the setting aside of a contract and relies on <span class="font-italic">Wiltopps (Asia) Ltd v Drew &amp; Napier</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 252 (“<span class="font-italic">Wiltopps</span>”) at [27] which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin</span> [2012] 3 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Poh</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]. She says that there is no basis to vary or set aside the Consent Order and therefore the application should be refused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Further, Ms Tan submits that where a party does not seek fortification of the undertaking when the relevant injunction order is made, the Court has no power subsequently to impose such an additional term on the grant of an injunction. She relies on the passage in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>vol 1 (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>vol 1”) at para 29/1/31 which cited the English High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Commodity Ocean Transport Corp v Basford Unicorn Industries Ltd, The Mito</span> [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 197 (“<span class="font-italic">The Mito</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As a third ground for rejecting the application Ms Tan submits that there is no credible evidence that this is an appropriate case for fortification to be ordered based on the principles in <span class="font-italic">CHS</span> because the evidence does not establish that there is a real risk of loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In relation to the sums put forward in Qilin’s submissions, she submits that the sums are not supported by evidence. First, in respect of the sums of US$151,231.87, US$159,640.10 and US$198,806.38 by way of interest paid on funds borrowed by Qilin under loan agreements made under a Master Framework Agreement dated 9 March 2016, she submits that Mr Man’s 3rd Affidavit and the documents exhibited to it do not substantiate that Qilin has suffered a loss or that it would be caused by the Consent Order. Rather, she says that the term sheets exhibited to Mr Man’s 3rd Affidavit indicate that Qilin committed to lending at least HK$1,435,000,000 and US$308,282,718.61, even excluding other sums in euros, IDRs and shares. She submits that, on this basis, there is no evidence that Qilin’s lending business would suffer by having provided the security of HK$27,532,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Secondly, in relation to the alleged revenue foregone, she submits that there is no evidence that Qilin could have entered into another loan agreement on identical or even similar terms to those in the Loan Agreement with CPIT. She refers to the Indications of Intent exhibited to Mr Man’s 3rd Affidavit and says that these are inadequate to establish that Qilin could have entered into similar loan agreements. In any event, she submits that there is no evidence of causation showing that the Consent Order was the cause of those transactions failing to materialise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Further, Ms Tan submits that the undertaking is not illusory as the evidence shows that there are sufficient assets to satisfy any liability under the undertaking. She says that it is undisputed that CPIT is a substantial shareholder of Millennium, with Mr Man in his 5th Affidavit saying that CPIT owns 186m further shares in Millennium. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 She says that Qilin is currently in possession of 2,860,000 of CPIT’s shares in Millennium and cannot rely on any decrease in the price of Millennium shares in support of its Fortification Application. She says that Qilin must have been aware that shares fluctuate in value but did not make this part of the agreement in the Consent Order. Further, she says that, before Qilin entered into the Agreements dated 16 November 2015, it was aware of possible downward movements in the share price and it is not uncommon for listed companies to have to defend lawsuits from time to time. In addition, she contends that Qilin’s wrongful conduct caused the drop in the price of Millennium shares by the unauthorised bulk selling of the Pledged Shares and she also relies on evidence to suggest that Qilin worked together with Mr Charles Zhi to commence a number of spurious proceedings against Millennium. Essentially, she says that Mr Man has exhibited to his 5th Affidavit a winding up petition for Millennium which Qilin must have obtained from Mr Zhi who, in the past, has commenced a large number of proceedings against another Hong Kong listed company which the Hong Kong courts found were vexatious. Mr Zhi also commenced separate proceedings against Millennium.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Although various references are made to the undertaking in relation to the Injunction, the application by Qilin relates to the undertaking in relation to the Consent Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I deal first with the nature of the Consent Order in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Consent Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As set out in [11] and [12] above, the Consent Order was made to compromise the application for a Mareva Injunction made by CPIT. Various discussions took place between the solicitors for the parties, MLS and RHT, starting from before the first hearing on 18 January 2016. When that hearing took place and the application was refused, a proposal was made by Qilin. This led to the hearing for leave to appeal on 27 January 2016 being adjourned and, in due course, to the Consent Order being made on 12 February 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The terms of the Consent Order and RHT’s letter of undertaking, together with the necessary variation of the terms of the Injunction were negotiated between the solicitors for the parties in a series of letters and marked up drafts exhibited at Exhibit CKCV-2 of the 3rd Affidavit of Chan Kwong Chi Vicky (“Ms Chan”). Those documents show that, as would be expected, the detailed terms of the Consent Order and Undertaking by Qilin’s solicitors were carefully considered and negotiated by the two experienced firms of solicitors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA, giving the judgment of the Court, set out the applicable law on consent orders at [18].

There are two meanings to the words ‘by consent’ … One meaning is this: the words … may evidence a real contract between the parties. In such a case the court will only interfere with such on order on the same grounds as it would with any other contract. The other meaning is this: the words ‘by consent’ may mean ‘the parties hereto not objecting’. In such a case there is no real contract between the parties. In every case it is necessary to discover which meaning is used. Does the order evidence a real contract between the parties? Or does it only evidence an order made without obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Given the way in which the Consent Order was negotiated in this case, there can be no doubt that it constituted a consent order arising from a real agreement between the parties. It contained detailed terms which the parties had negotiated and incorporated into a court order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The question is whether the Consent Order can be varied by the Court so as to add a term requiring fortification of the undertaking as to damages which CPIT gave as part of the Consent Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Variation of Consent Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Again, in the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA summarised the law on this aspect at [18], where he said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are two possible bases upon which the Appellants can be precluded from opening up an issue which they consented or agreed to before the AR.

It was deliberately made, with full knowledge, and with the full agreement of the solicitors on both sides. It cannot be set aside. But, even though it cannot be set aside, there is still a question whether it should be enforced. The court has always a control over interlocutory orders.

However, he went on at [79] to consider the extent to which the Court had a discretion of the type suggested in <span class="font-italic">Purcell v Trigell</span> where Lord Denning said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But, even though the order cannot be set aside, there is still a question whether it should be enforced.

In this regard, I also respectfully differ from the view preferred by Lee JC in the <span class="font-italic">Wiltopps</span> case, and I do so for the following main reason. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90 It must be borne in mind that a consent unless order, whilst technically a contract between the parties, is one that allows one party to wholly deprive the other of its legal rights in the context of litigation. Even though such an order has been agreed upon between the parties, there may, in my view, arise certain special circumstances where it would nevertheless be unjust for the party in whose favour the consent order operates to insist on its enforcement in the absence of a high degree of intentionally contumacious or contumelious conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91 Such a discretion is, in the final analysis, merely an aspect of the court’s power to have ultimate control over its own procedure. This is not at all unreasonable, in my view, and does, on balance, conduce to justice and fairness. The focus is still on procedure, rather than substance. It might be argued that the substantive rights of the plaintiff would be adversely affected. This is arguably the case but it must never be forgotten that an unless order is part of the procedural armoury and is not based on the substantive merits of the case as such. Thus, an unless order (whether by consent or otherwise) deals, in the final analysis, with the <span class="font-italic">litigation process and, on this score, the courts ought to have the final say</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, Phang J was anxious to point out at [93] that “any ‘interference’ by the court in this particular regard would be rare and would need to be thoroughly justified in the circumstances of the case.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kao Chai-Chau Linda</span> [2014] 2 SLR 693 (“<span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>”), George Wei JC (as he then was) referred to the principles to be applied to consent orders in these terms at [22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In this regard, reliance has also been placed on the principle that where a consent order represents a “real contract” between the parties and is recorded before the court, the court should only vary or set aside the consent order pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law (see <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence</span> [2011] SGHC 184, <span class="font-italic">Wiltopps (Asia) Ltd v Drew &amp; Napier</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 252 and <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117). Nevertheless, it is reasonably clear that even in the case of a contractual consent order, the court retains the residual discretion to vary its terms where this is necessary to prevent injustice. This is especially so where the court is dealing with a “consent unless” order, which if not adhered to, will deprive a party of its rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 That residual discretion to vary the terms of a consent order to prevent injustice was, as George Wei JC said at [23], based on the terms of O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In arriving at my decision, I accept that even in the case of a contractual consent order, the court retains the residual discretion to vary or set aside the terms of the consent order. After all, O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) states that nothing in the ROC “shall be deemed to limit or to affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of Court”. Whether a distinction is to be made between a contractual “consent unless” order and other forms of contractual consent order is not a matter which this court must rule on today. Suffice it to say that in the interests of justice, greater care must be taken in those cases where the court is dealing with a “consent unless” order. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On analysis, <span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span> and <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span> are concerned with the inability of the court to prevent injustice if the terms of an interlocutory consent order are strictly enforced. This applies in cases such as “unless orders” where a party applies for judgment or seeks an extension of the time for compliance.  Those matters have also exercised the English Courts. In <span class="font-italic">Ropac Limited v Inntrepreneur Pub Company (CPC) Limited</span> [2001] CP Rep 31 (“<span class="font-italic">Ropac</span>”), Neuberger J (as he then was) had to consider the enforcement of a consent unless order for the possession of premises where the condition of the unless order had not been complied with. That condition required payment of a sum by a particular date, with time being of the essence. Half that sum was paid by that date and half was paid some ten days late. Having reviewed the authorities Neuberger J concluded that under the former Rules of the Supreme Court the consent order “would have been sufficiently clear terms to have justified interference by the Court only in circumstances which would justify interference with a contract.” Although he found that the provisions of the then recent Civil Procedure Rules were “more flexible, so that the Court does have jurisdiction to grant relief, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> to extend time”, he declined to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the subsequent English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Weston v Dayman</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 1165 the Court had to consider a consent order discharging a receivership and whether it was to be interpreted as releasing the defendant receiver from all liability for any failure properly to manage the estate of the receivership during the period of the receivership. The Court of Appeal held that it was. There was then an argument that the Court was able to vary the order under the Civil Procedure Rules or under the “liberty to apply” provision. In considering those arguments, Arden LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal referred to <span class="font-italic">Ropac</span> and said at [24] and [25]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24. … Neuberger J held in a nutshell that, even when parties have come to a consent order, in that case on an extension of time, there was an exceptional jurisdiction whereunder the court could still extend time. In my judgment, wherever the jurisdiction comes from — and it could come from the liberty to apply in this order — the court must be very careful in exercising a discretion to vary the terms of an order which represents a contract between the parties. Mr Warwick argues forcibly that this jurisdiction should be exercised so as to enable these proceedings to proceed to trial, because Elias J has already given permission, because it must surely be the policy of the court to allow proper claims to be brought against officers of the court in respect of mismanagement, and because the point was only taken by the receiver in her defence. It was not taken at the earlier stage, at which she was represented, when Elias J gave permission. In addition, of course, the damage to which he refers was not damage of which Mr Weston could have been aware at the date of the order. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25. I will proceed on the basis (without deciding the point) that CPR 3.1(7) applies to paragraph 10 of the order of 23 January 2003. I would accept that the court should accede to an application for variation where it is just to do so but in my judgment one of the aspects of justice is that a bargain freely made should be upheld. Mr Weston clearly obtained benefits under the order of 23 January 2003. It may well be that those benefits are not as great as he thought, but that is not a matter for this court. In those circumstances I do not consider it would be right for this court to exercise its discretion to vary the order as sought. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On the basis of those decisions, I come to the following conclusions about the ability of this Court to vary the terms of a Consent Order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The general principle is that a consent judgment or consent order is binding and cannot be set aside save for exceptional reasons: see <span class="font-italic">Poh</span> at [18].  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Those exceptional reasons are those referred to in <span class="font-italic">Wiltopps</span> and <span class="font-italic">Baker</span><span class="font-italic">y Mart</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Poh</span> at [18].

It would add a new requirement to the carefully drafted and negotiated terms of the Consent Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 There is no basis put forward upon which the Court could vary the Consent Order on grounds that would justify the setting aside or variation of a contract. If Qilin now has concerns about the financial position of CPIT and its ability to meet the undertaking as to damages, that was not something that formed part of the agreement in the Consent Order and no term was agreed by which a change in the financial circumstances of CPIT, if there has been one, could be relied on to obtain a change to the agreed terms. There is no ability otherwise for one party to obtain a variation to the terms of an agreement because of change of circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 There are therefore no exceptional reasons of the type envisaged in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span>, <span class="font-italic">Wiltopps</span> or <span class="font-italic">Baker</span><span class="font-italic">y Mart</span> which would justify the variation of the terms of the Consent Order by way of fortification of the terms of the agreed undertaking as to damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 To the extent that rare cases where O 92 r 4 can be relied on in relation to enforcement of consent orders or to extend time in relation to consent orders or where the “liberty to apply” provision may be relied on, per <span class="font-italic">Weston v Dayman</span>, there is nothing on the facts of this case which would make it possible to rely on such provisions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Subsequent fortification of an undertaking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As the matter has been argued, it is convenient also to deal with the basis on which an undertaking might be fortified after the Injunction was originally granted on the basis of an undertaking which was not fortified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As set out in para 29/1/31 of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</span> vol 1:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A defendant should apply for the security at the time when the injunction is granted and the undertaking is given.

If they had been asked to do so, it may very well be that they would … “have declined to take an injunction”. Of course, Mr McClure accepts, as he must, that the court has no power to impose an undertaking on the plaintiffs; and here I think if I were to make this order I would in essence ex post facto be imposing an additional term to the undertaking without any knowledge one way or the other as to what the situation would have been if it had been sought by the defendants in the first place.

Either the interim injunction comes into operation upon being made or it does not, in other words the condition cannot be imposed or superimposed retrospectively.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 More recently in <span class="font-italic">Thai-Lao Lignite (Thailand) Co. Ltd v The Government of The Lao People’s Democratic Republic</span> [2013] EWHC 2466 (Comm) Popplewell J considered a case where fortification was originally given but where further fortification was sought because of an increase in the estimate of costs suffered as a result of a freezing order. At [45] he said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court cannot require a claimant to give an undertaking. When fortification of a cross undertaking is required, it is not imposed by an order of the court that it must be given. It is part of the undertaking offered by a claimant, and the grant of the order is conditional upon the undertaking being complied with. This is reflected in the standard wording of the Commercial Court freezing order. Requiring fortification is an adjunct to the undertaking offered by a claimant, and is only “required” in the sense of being the price which the claimant will have to pay if he wants his order to operate in futuro. The fortification now sought by the Central Bank is an adjunct to the undertaking originally voluntarily given by the Claimants, and to attach a fortification requirement to such undertaking now, after the Central Bank accounts have been removed from the scope of the Freezing Order, would be in substance to impose upon the Claimants an undertaking they did not give. Moreover it would be to impose a retrospective burden upon the Claimants whilst at the same time depriving them of the opportunity of considering whether to assume that burden as the price of obtaining the Freezing Order over the Central Bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I consider that these decisions indicate that there are two principles which militate against the subsequent grant of fortification of an undertaking where no such fortification was originally provided. The first is that the Court decides whether to grant an injunction based on the conditions which it considers to be appropriate at that time. A party seeking an injunction cannot be forced to give an undertaking or to fortify it but the Court will not grant an injunction unless the conditions of an undertaking including, if considered necessary, fortification, are fulfilled. If fortification is not made a condition initially then the injunction is granted on the basis that fortification was not required and to fortify the undertaking later would be to impose an undertaking which the party did not agree to give. The second, related principle is that if fortification is granted at a later date then it would relate back to the original undertaking and therefore impose a retrospective burden as the price of the original injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Whilst the fact that the fortification is sought after the discharge of the injunction heightens the impact of those principles, I consider that they apply equally where the injunction is continuing. In addition, in the present case, although the Injunction was not originally granted as part of a Consent Order, it is evident that when the Consent Order was made the parties considered the extent to which the terms of the Injunction should be varied and no provision as to fortification was requested. The absence of any condition of fortification as part of the undertaking for the original Injunction together with the absence of any agreed fortification as part of the arrangements under the Consent Order, when considered in the light of the principles identified above, mean that, in my judgement, fortification should not be ordered at this stage. The imposition of such fortification which was not originally a condition of the grant of the Consent Order and which would have retrospective effect is not something that is appropriate in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is fortification otherwise appropriate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Even if this were to be a case where fortification might, in principle, be granted, I do not consider that Qilin has made out a case for it to be ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As set out in <span class="font-italic">CHS</span>, for fortification of an undertaking, there must be a real risk of loss arising from the grant of the injunction and the fortification is then required to ensure that there are sufficient assets within or outside the jurisdiction that would be readily available to satisfy any liability under the undertaking. In the recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Energy Venture Partners Ltd v Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd</span> [2015] 1 WLR 2309 (“<span class="font-italic">Energy Venture Partners</span>”), the English Court of Appeal considered the principles to be applied in relation to fortification. In that case, a party against whom a freezing order had been made was given liberty to apply to increase the sum by which an undertaking should be fortified. The judge at first instance had applied the principles set out by Mr Michael Briggs QC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Harley Street Capital Ltd v Tchigirinski </span>[2005] EWHC 2471 (Ch). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On appeal, at [13] Tomlinson LJ summarised three requirements which had been identified by Mr Briggs as needing to be satisfied by a defendant seeking fortification as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [F]irst, that the court has made an intelligent estimate of the likely amount of loss which might result to a defendant by reason of the injunction; secondly, that the applicant for fortification has shown a sufficient level of risk of loss to require fortification; and, thirdly, that the contemplated loss would be caused by the grant of the injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 At [52] the Court of Appeal endorsed that approach as being “entirely appropriate and in accordance with principle.” At [53] to [54] Tomlinson LJ also added some observations on the proof required to establish the risk of loss:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52. … since the claimant has obtained a freezing order preserving assets over which it may be able to enforce on the basis of having shown the court that it has a good arguable case, it is only appropriate that if the defendant can show that it too has a good arguable case that it will suffer loss in consequence of the making of the order, it should equally be protected. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53. … In this interlocutory context, showing a sufficient level of risk of loss to require fortification is synonymous with showing a good arguable case to that effect. In some cases the assessment of loss may at the interlocutory stage be difficult. It is in such cases that an intelligent estimate is required. An intelligent estimate will be informed and realistic although it may not be entirely scientific.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54. As to causation, it is sufficient for the court to be satisfied that the making of the order or injunction was a cause without which the relevant loss would not have been suffered, as Gibbs J put it in the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Air Express Ltd v Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty</span> (1981) 146 CLR 249, 313. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 To the extent that it makes any difference, I consider that the applicable standard, as expressed in <span class="font-italic">CHS</span> of “an at least reasonable basis for legal liability” is the standard to be applied in this jurisdiction. Otherwise I derive assistance from the other guidance in <span class="font-italic">Energy Venture Partners</span>. I therefore turn to consider whether Qilin has established a good arguable case of a sufficient level of risk of loss caused by the Consent Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Under the Consent Order Qilin deposited a sum equivalent to the then value of the Millennium shares. In his 3rd Affidavit Mr Man states at para 25:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The making of the Injunction Orders is and was a cause of the loss suffered by the 2nd Defendant without which the relevant loss would not be or would not have been suffered.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At para 27 he then states: “Annexed hereto are copies of the following documents in support of the 2nd Defendant's application herein…”. He then refers to:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Recent signed term sheets, and closing statements evidencing deals that were done … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Funding documents in respect of 2 funding deals. For these deals the 2nd Defendant had to pay 10% and 12% respectively for the funding due to lack of funds caused by the Injunction Orders … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Signed Indication of Intent and settlement information, which the 2nd Defendant was unable to execute due to the lack of funds caused by the Injunction Orders … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Signed Indication of Intent which the 2nd Defendant was unable to execute due to the lack of funds caused by the Injunction Orders … and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) Further signed block term sheets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 At para 28 Mr Man then says the losses suffered by Qilin include the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">i. interest paid on the funds borrowed amounting to US$151,231.87 and US$159,640.10 for the 1st funding deal; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">ii. interest paid on the funds borrowed amounting to US$198,806.38 for the 2nd funding deal; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">iii. revenue foregone from utilising the funds frozen by the Injunction Orders to enter into another loan agreement on the same terms as the Loan Agreement between the Plaintiff and 2nd Defendant, that is 6% pre-payment lockout +1% placement/origination fee +0.5% administration charge = 7.5% of HK$31,250,000.00, or HK$2,343,750.00.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The question is whether this evidence is sufficient for Qilin to discharge the burden of establishing a sufficient risk of loss or that the loss was or would be caused by the Consent Order. Mr Nandakumar relied on the passage from Floyd J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Holyoake</span> where at [25] he said in relation to losses sought to be relied on:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not easy at this stage definitively to relate many of these instances to the preventive or coercive effects of the order. Nevertheless I think it is realistic to suppose that the existence of the freezing order could cause significant damage to Mr Holyoake. Firstly, it is clear from the evidence that Mr Holyoake has an extensive asset portfolio. It is almost inevitable that the existence of the freezing order will cause him loss. The assets discussed in the evidence are worth millions of pounds. It is entirely reasonable to suppose that damage will be incurred on a commensurate scale by Mr Holyoake if he is unable to deal freely and properly with his assets. Secondly, the freezing order is a very extensive one, and does not relate solely to one or two assets. As Mann J observed in <span class="font-italic">Sinclair Investment Holdings SA v Cushnie</span>, it will be easier to foresee a risk of loss in such cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 However, in <span class="font-italic">Pugachev</span> where the judge at first instance had relied on similar reasoning, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal finding that the evidence did not support that conclusion. Lewison LJ said at [99]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not difficult to imagine a case in which a defendant is able to give evidence that up to the grant of a freezing order he was in the habit of making deals or engaging in business ventures over a sustained period and that his established pattern of business enterprise would be stifled by the grant of an order freezing all his assets. In such a case the defendant may have real difficulty in predicting what particular business opportunities are likely to arise in the future. But it would be necessary in such a case to establish by evidence a continuing pattern of business activity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Lewison LJ then said “[w]hat evidence is there of business activity during that period? The short answer is that there is virtually none.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the present case, Qilin relies on Mr Man’s evidence. As Ms Tan submitted, the term sheet documents exhibited to Mr Man’s 3rd Affidavit show that Qilin has sufficient assets to commit to lending at least HK$1,435,000,000 and US$308,282,718.61, excluding other sums in euros, IDRs and shares. It is therefore difficult, in the absence of any evidence, to see why Qilin has incurred interest charges because of the sums restrained under the Consent Orders rather than for other reasons. No explanation is provided by Mr Man, other than by way of assertion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In relation to the loss of revenue because Qilin was unable to enter into another loan agreement on similar terms to those in the Loan Agreement, Mr Man has exhibited Indications of Intent to his 3rd Affidavit. However, it is not evident that, but for the Consent Order, Qilin could or would have entered into similar loan agreements. There is no explanation in the affidavit to show that Qilin did not complete the loan agreements because of the Consent Order rather than the potential loan agreements merely not materialising as completed transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Whilst Counsel’s submissions seek to provide further evidence of the nature of Qilin’s business, as pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Pugachev</span>, it is necessary for there to be evidence of the way in which Qilin’s business would be affected or, in this case, has been affected by the Consent Order. I do not consider that there is sufficient evidence and, in the absence of that evidence, I would have been reluctant to draw the type of inferences which Floyd J was able to draw from the evidence in <span class="font-italic">Holyoake</span> but which could not be drawn in <span class="font-italic">Pugachev</span>.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For those reasons I do not grant the fortification of the Consent Order sought in the Fortification Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Variation Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Mr Nandakumar submits that following the grant of the Injunction on 18 January 2016 there has been a material change of circumstances and that, relying on a passage in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> <span class="font-italic">2015 </span>vol 1 at para 29/1/42, he submits that an injunction granted after a full <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing can be varied if there has been a material change in circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The change of circumstances relied on by Mr Nandakumar arises from a fall in the value of the Millennium shares which are the subject of Order 1 of the Injunction. He says that Millennium became the subject of a suit in the High Court in Hong Kong on 15 April 2016 and then issued an announcement about that suit on 9 June 2016. He says that Qilin received information on or around 7 July 2016 that CPIT was seeking to sell the Millennium shares in its possession at a discount of 35% and it also came to Qilin’s attention that CPIT no longer exists or operates at its two last known addresses in Hong Kong. He further says that on or around 11 July 2016 a winding-up action was commenced against Millennium in the Hong Kong Courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Mr Nandakumar says that between 9 and 15 June 2016 the share price of the Millennium shares fell from HK$1.40 to HK$1.25; on 24 June 2016 it fell from HK$1.22 to HK$0.93; on 27 June 2016 it fell to HK$0.56; on 12 July 2016 it fell to HK$0.25 and on 22 July 2016 it stood at HK$0.207 and on 28 July he said it was about HK$0.20. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As a result, he says that, in the light of the uncertain financial position of CPIT and to ensure that the parties’ interests are not prejudiced and to mitigate the potential losses due to the fluctuation in share prices, Order 1 of the Injunction should be varied so that the 2,860,000 shares in Millennium can be sold and the sale proceeds preserved pending the final disposal of these proceedings. He submits that, in circumstances where CPIT has not been open as to its financial position and where Qilin is unable to avail itself of its only recourse of selling the Millennium shares, Qilin is placed in a very vulnerable position and so seeks the variation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Ms Tan submits that there should be no variation of Order 1 of the Injunction. First, she refers to the background which led to the Consent Order made on 12 February 2016. She says that the Consent Order superseded the Order of 18 January 2016 and that Qilin is seeking to vary the Consent Order. Further she says that the balance of convenience points against allowing a sale of the shares when the share price has fallen. Further she contends that Qilin has brought the variation application in bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 She refers to Order 1 of the Consent Order which states that Order 1 of the Injunction shall continue to remain in effect. She submits that a variation of Order 1 of the Injunction would amount to a variation of the Consent Order which, as set out above, is only permitted where such variation can be made on the basis of normal contractual principles, which she says do not apply here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Secondly, she submits that the balance of convenience is in favour of dismissing the Variation Application. She says that the price of shares fluctuates and that possible falls in the value of the Millennium shares were known to Qilin in the form of announcements made by Millennium on 5 June and 15 October 2015 as dealt with in the 3rd and 4th Affidavits of Ms Chan. She says that when CPIT pledged the shares to Qilin in December 2015, Qilin valued the shares at HK$2.50 and that it was only when the share price was HK$0.56 on 27 June 2016 that Qilin first suggested that the shares might be sold. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 She says that Qilin did not proceed expeditiously and that although a hearing was fixed for 7 July 2016, RHT made a request to re-fix/vacate hearing dates on 5 July 2016. In that request RHT said that it had come to Qilin’s attention that the price of Millennium shares on the Hong Kong Exchange had stabilised and that the drop in the price of the Millennium shares might be attributed to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, certain developments in Millennium which might adversely affect CPIT’s financial standing. RHT said that, arising from these developments, Qilin was of the view that there was therefore no requirement to have the application heard on an urgent basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As a result, she submits that given the fall in the price of Millennium shares and the absence of urgency, it made more sense to wait for an increase in the share price rather than to sell them after the price had “crashed”. She further submits that the disposal of Millennium shares was likely only to drive the price down further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In addition, Ms Tan refers to Qilin’s contention that its only recourse under the loan agreement is to the Millennium shares and says that this contradicts Qilin’s pleaded counterclaim for the loan amount of HK$31,250,000. She says that the Millennium shares were not preserved for Qilin’s benefit but as part of the security that Qilin gave CPIT for CPIT’s claims. She refers to the letter of undertaking issued by RHT in which it was stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Qilin] have 2,860,000 of the Pledged Shares, which are, for the sole purpose of the issuance of the undertaking herein, valued at the sum of HK$3,718,000.00 as at 28 January 2016, based on the market price of shares in Millennium at HK$1.30 per share as at 28 January 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">She says that this shows that the remaining Millennium shares represent CPIT’s security which Qilin had agreed to provide.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Injunction was made after hearing submissions from the parties and in order to preserve the shares which, in these proceedings, CPIT says were unlawfully disposed of by Qilin but Qilin says it was entitled to dispose of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The terms of the Consent Order were negotiated on the basis that those shares had a particular value and therefore the sums secured by the Consent Order depended on the shares being retained as shares. The parties could have agreed to the sale of the shares in Order 1 of the Injunction but did not and proceeded on the agreed basis that they had a certain value. Whilst it is evident that the price of the Millennium shares is now well below the value which the parties put on those shares at the time of the Consent Order, by the time of the hearing of the Variation Application the value of the Millennium shares had already decreased significantly.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I have come to the conclusion that I should not allow the Variation Application. First, although Order 1 of the Injunction was not a consent order, the parties made the Consent Order on the basis of Order 1 of the Injunction, each accepting that the share value could, on the usual basis, rise or fall. Secondly, whilst shares have a commercial value, shares also have a non-monetary value to a particular party and the court decided to grant the Injunction to preserve the Millennium shares as an asset. I do not consider that a fall in the value of those shares justifies converting that asset into cash. Thirdly, share values do fluctuate. Whilst there may be underlying reasons why the value of Millennium shares has fallen, they appear to have stabilized and may increase in value. Converting the shares into cash at this stage does not appear to have any advantage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Accordingly, I do not consider that Qilin have established that there is any good reason why the Millennium shares should be converted to cash at this stage. I therefore do not allow the Variation Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Subsequent to the hearing, RHT wrote to the Court on 1 September 2016 saying that it had come to Qilin’s attention that CPIT was in the process of negotiating with potential investors for the sale of its 1,288,900,000 Millennium shares. RHT referred to a Voluntary Announcement dated 30 August 2016 (“the Announcement”) and submitted that the Court could take judicial notice of it, referring to ss 58 and 59 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan v Lian Beng Construction (1988) Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 587. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 On 2 September 2016 MLS responded to RHT’s communication, objecting to the further evidence and arguments by Qilin and challenging the basis on which the matter is sought to be put before the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I would, in any event, be reluctant to accept further evidence or argument after the parties have had a full opportunity to put in evidence and make submissions. If I were persuaded that new evidence which arose subsequent to the hearing would have a major impact on the Fortification or Variation Applications then I would have considered whether it was appropriate to give directions for further argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The relevance of the new evidence, as indicated in RHT’s letter of 31 August 2016, is that CPIT is negotiating to dispose of a substantial part of its assets. I do not consider that this provides any ground to re-open any of the issues which have arisen on the Fortification Application and which I have dealt with above. Nor do I consider that the fact that CPIT has made a commercial decision to negotiate to sell its Millennium shares, if Qilin is correct, can be taken to support the Variation Application. The Injunction preserves certain Millennium shares as assets but that does not prevent CPIT from selling other shares, if that is what it is doing, and nor does it mean that the shares preserved in the Injunction should be converted into cash.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Accordingly, I do not accede to Qilin’s request that I should take judicial notice of the Announcement and I do not consider that I should direct that there should be further argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For the reasons set out above I dismiss the Fortification and Variation Applications. I will hear any consequential matters (including the issue of costs) at the further Case Management conference on 23 September 2016, if they are not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vivian Ramsey<br/>International Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Poh Ling Wendy and Kenneth Chua (Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Renganathan Nandakumar, Vernon Voon and Sharon Chung (RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span>These two applications arose out of a dispute between CPIT Investments Limited (“CPIT”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and two companies, both known as Qilin World Capital Limited (“Qilin”), incorporated in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands respectively. Under a loan agreement, CPIT provided 25,000,000 shares in Millennium Pacific Group Holdings Limited (“Millennium”), a publicly listed company in Hong Kong, as collateral for a loan of HK$31,250,000 from Qilin. CPIT contended that Qilin had unlawfully sold the Millennium shares. In contrast, Qilin contended that it was entitled to deal with the shares as it did, and that in any event, due to certain failures of CPIT, it became the legal and beneficial owners of the shares. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span>CPIT thus brought proceedings against Qilin in the High Court. At the same time, CPIT made two applications to the High Court: (a) for an injunction prohibiting Qilin from disposing of the unsold shares (“Order 1 of the Injunction”) and the proceeds of sale of any shares which had been sold (“Order 2 of the Injunction”); and (b) for a worldwide Mareva injunction against Qilin up to the value of HK$31,250,000. The High Court granted the Injunction application. With regard to the Mareva injunction application, the parties decided to enter into an agreement, which was eventually recorded as a Consent Order before the High Court. Under the Consent Order, Order 1 of the Injunction was to remain in effect, while Order 2 of the Injunction was varied such that Qilin was to pay the proceeds of sale to the client account of Qilin’s solicitors as security for CPIT’s claim. CPIT also provided an undertaking to compensate Qilin for any loss arising from Qilin’s provision of security. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span>Subsequently, Qilin filed the present two applications. These applications were placed before Vivian Ramsey IJ sitting in the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) after CPIT’s action was transferred from the High Court to the SICC. The first is an application to vary Order 1 of the Injunction such that Qilin is at liberty to sell the unsold shares (“the Variation Application”), while the second is an application for CPIT to provide fortification of its undertaking to compensate Qilin for any loss (“the Fortification Application”). Qilin’s basis for the applications was that the price of the shares had fallen drastically, and CPIT’s financial circumstances might be affected as a result. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span>In his written judgment, Ramsey IJ held with respect to the Variation Application that the Consent Order arose from a real agreement between the parties and was therefore binding and could not be varied save on grounds that would justify the variation of a contract. Ramsey IJ further found that the parties had made the Consent Order on the basis of Order 1 of the Injunction, each accepting that the value of the shares could ordinarily rise or fall. His Honour also held that shares do have a non-monetary value to a particular party and the Injunction was granted to preserve the Millennium shares as an asset. In any case, the value of the shares also appeared to have stabilized and might increase in value. Ramsey IJ therefore ruled that Qilin had failed to establish any good reason for the shares to be converted into cash at the current stage.</span></p>

<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span>With respect to the Fortification Application, Ramsey IJ found that adding a term for CPIT to fortify its undertaking would amount to a variation of the Consent Order. However, Qilin had not put forward any valid ground to justify such a variation. A change in CPIT’s financial circumstances, if there had been one, was insufficient. If Qilin wanted CPIT to fortify its undertaking, Qilin should have pursued that either at the original Injunction application or when the parties agreed to the Consent Order. In any event, Ramsey IJ found that Qilin had not shown it faced a sufficient risk of loss caused by the Consent Order. An order for fortification would therefore not be appropriate in the circumstances. </span></p>

<p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span>The Court thus dismissed both of Qilin’s applications.          </span></p>
