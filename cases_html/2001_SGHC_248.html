<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. The appellants, Cornelder Hoogewerff (Singapore) Pte Ltd
(hereinafter referred to as "CHS"), sought to have the action of the
respondents, Concordia Agritrading Pte Ltd (hereinafter </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">referred to as "CAP"), struck out on the ground that it was
time-barred. Their application was dismissed by the Senior Assistant Registrar. The
appellants appealed against the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar. I dismissed
the appeal and set out below the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. CAP, a company trading in agricultural commodities, including maize
and soya bean, entered into a series of contracts with Lam Chuan Guan Pte Ltd (hereinafter
referred to as "LGC") for the sale and delivery of Latin American and USA bulk
commodities. The conditions of sale were "CAD ex Warehouse in either Sembawang Port,
Port Butterworth or Port Klang".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. CHS are warehousemen, who also provide warehouse management services
for inventory control of goods stored in the warehouse. On 13 November 1995, CAP appointed
CHS as the warehousing agents for their agricultural commodities that were shipped to
Malaysia. According to the terms of the agreement, CHS would oversee the offloading of
CAP’s cargo from vessels, the transportation of the same to a warehouse, at which the
commodities would be stored, and the delivery of the cargo to LGC. It was also agreed that
as CHS did not have its own handling and warehousing facilities in the respective ports
whereas LGC had a contract with the authorities in the said ports for the leasing of
warehouses and the use of handling services, CHS would utilise the handling and
warehousing facilities available to LGC. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. It was a term in CAP’s agreement with CHS that although the
goods may be stored in warehouses provided by LGC, CHS shall only release the cargo
entrusted to them to the party named by CAP in their written instructions. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. In late 1997, LGC encountered financial difficulties and failed to
perform their contractual obligations. As a result, CAP recalled the agricultural
commodities stored in the Malaysian warehouses. CAP then discovered that the quantity of
cargo in the warehouses did not correspond with the quantity reported in the stock reports
issued by CHS. Furthermore, some of the cargo had been damaged. On 18 March 1998, CAP
wrote the following letter to CHS:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We understand that part of the goods are damaged and part of the goods
    are not in the place where they are supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">You are and we hold you responsible for the above.</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We hereby invite you for a joint survey which is to take place as soon
    as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. It is CAP’s case that CHS failed to take reasonable care of the
cargo and/or wrongfully and/or negligently released the cargo or part thereof to persons
unknown. On 24 March 1998, CAP informed CHS that preliminary estimates showed that 6,000
metric tons of maize were missing in Port Klang while 8,000 metric tons of maize and 7,000
metric tons of soya beans were missing in Butterworth. CAP demanded from CHS the payment
of US$3,360,000 and the provision of security acceptable to them for a further sum of
US$1,092,000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. CAP attempted to resolve their differences with CHS through
arbitration. However, CHS refused to have the dispute resolved through arbitration on the
ground that they were not obliged to do so. CAP filed OS No 581 of 1999 on 20 April 1999
for the purpose of having three arbitrators appointed to resolve their dispute with CHS.
Their application was dismissed and the Court of Appeal confirmed on 22 February 2000 that
CHS were not obliged to resolve their dispute with CAP through arbitration.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. Having failed to have their dispute with CHS resolved through
arbitration, CAP then instituted an action against CHS on 29 December 2000 for damages for
breach of contract. In this action, CAP claimed to have suffered a huge loss of
US$4,872,128.30 as a result of CHS’ alleged failures.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. CHS pointed out that CAP’s cargo had been in the warehouses
leased by LGC since November or December 1997, more than 12 months before the action was
instituted by CAP on 29 December 2000. In view of this, CHS contended that CAP’s
claim was barred by clause 36 of chapter 1 of their Warehousing Conditions, which provided
as follows: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Any claims against the company on account of loss, damage or decrease
    in quantity of the goods given in custody to the company and, in general, on account of
    failure by the company to comply with their obligations, shall lapse after twelve (12)
    months of storage. In case of damage or decrease in so far as the company has not notified
    the customer of this damage or decrease, the said period of twelve (12) months shall
    commence at the end of the day on which the company has notified the customer.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. CHS further argued that as the action was time-barred, it was
frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court and should be struck out
pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Often enough, a contract contains a provision requiring that a
claim be promptly made. In the context of the obligations of insurers and warehousemen,
such as CHS, there are good reasons for requiring that claims be made promptly. The
obvious commercial purpose of such a requirement is to enable the party against whom a
claim is made to investigate the claim at the earliest opportunity and reduce the risk of
fraudulent claims. (See, for instance, Bingham J’s judgment in <i>Pioneer Concrete
(UK) Ltd v National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd </i>[1985] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 274, 278). Furthermore, the party against whom a claim is made promptly
may be able to take steps to mitigate the consequences of a loss. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></i> 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. CHS’ assertion that CAP’s claim is time-barred is flawed.
CAP had demanded compensation for their loss within the period specified in clause 36 of
chapter 1 of their Warehousing Conditions. In the circumstances of this case, this clause
did not have the added effect of requiring an action to be instituted by CAP within the
period specified therein. In<i> Pera Shipping Corporation v Petroship SA (The Pera) </i>[1985]
2 Lloyd’s Rep 103, 108, Slade LJ rightly reiterated that if there remains any real
doubt, the ambiguity in a contract must not be resolved in such a way as to bar a possibly
legitimate claim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The appeal against the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar
was thus dismissed with costs.</p>
