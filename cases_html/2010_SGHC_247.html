        Lee Seiu Kin J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 1 July 2009 I delivered my written
                    judgment (“the Judgment”) in this Suit with an order for parties
                    to make submissions on the question of costs. However, due to the complexities
                    of this case, which was completed only after 42 hearing days and in which there
                    are four defendants and a total of five counterclaims, I gave liberty to the
                    parties to apply for clarifications of my orders in the Judgment. In the event,
                    the parties appeared before me on the question of costs and also for
                    clarifications as well as further arguments to correct certain errors in the
                    Judgment. This occupied another three days, at the end of which I found it
                    necessary to issue this Addendum to the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In this Addendum, I adopt the same nomenclature
                    used in the Judgment. The Addendum will state the relevant parts of the Judgment
                    that are modified or altered, with the reasons for them wherever applicable. In
                    the event of any conflict between this Addendum and the Judgment, this Addendum
                    is to take precedence over the Judgment. There have been submissions made by
                    various parties on various points that I have considered but rejected. Some of
                    those submissions are not reflected in this Addendum; I did not consider this
                    necessary in view of the fact that I maintained those parts of my original
                    decision, the reasons for which have been given in the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Typographical errors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There were two typographical errors in the
                    Judgment: at [18], the words “provisional costs items” in the
                    second sentence should read “prime costs items” and at [68], the
                    words “Hok Mee” in the last sentence should read “Hok
                    Chung”. Those paragraphs in the Judgment should be read
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overpayments to Hok Chung</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In [31] of the Judgment I had found that Hok
                    Chung had been overpaid the sum of $3,394,400 and ordered Hok Mee to refund this
                    amount to the Partnership. At [40] of the Judgment I also made Hok Chung liable
                    to refund this amount to the Partnership. I had arrived at the sum of $5,091,600
                    as the total of the PC Rate items paid to Hok Chung and based on my finding that
                    the actual cost was only one-third of this amount, I had found that Hok Chung
                    had been overpaid by two-thirds of that amount, <em>viz</em> $3,394,400. However in computing this I had not taken into
                    consideration the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     An item called “Granite Niche
                        Cover to Modules $1,462,880” had been omitted from the works and the
                        item had been considered in AGA’s Qualified Final Account. Therefore
                        this item should be excluded from the computation of the total PC Rate
                        items.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was
                        a change to granolithic finishes (in lieu of granite finish) to the floor of
                        the Annex Block which resulted in an omission of $1,078,206.40. As Hok Chung
                        was similarly not paid for this, it should also be excluded from the total
                        PC Rate items.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Hok Chung was entitled to 15% profit for attendance for works carried out
                        and this works out to be $127,525.68.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the premises,
                    the total overpayment to Hok Chung would be two-thirds of
                    ($5,091,600-$1,462,880-$1,078,206.40) with a deduction for profit for attendance
                    of $127,525.68, which results in the sum of $1,572,816.72.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Therefore, the order in [31] of the Judgment
                    should be for Hok Mee to refund to the Partnership the sum of $1,572,816.72 and
                    in [40] of the Judgment, for Hok Chung to refund $1,572,816.72 to the
                    Partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loans to PLD directors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At [35] of the Judgment, I had found that PLD
                    and Hok Mee had to account to the Partnership for the $800,000 advanced to four
                    directors of PLD out of the proceeds of sale of the niches. There I had held
                    that they should be liable in the ratio of their respective shares of the
                    profits. However I agree with counsel for Hok Mee that the apportionment should
                    be equal on the ground that it did not concern any sharing of profit as no
                    profit was eventually made by the Partnership. Therefore my order in [35] of the
                    Judgment is to be amended accordingly, and PLD is liable for $400,000.00 and Hok
                    Mee also for $400,000.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Commission to the Temple</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In [36] of the Judgment, I had found that the
                    Temple was entitled to outstanding commission of $1m from the Partnership. As
                    the commission was to be paid from the gross proceeds of sale, this debt is to
                    rank ahead of all other payments due from the Partnership. Hok Mee submitted
                    that this debt should rank <em>pari passu</em> with the
                    loans and advances made by PLD, Hok Mee and Hok Chung. I do not agree with this
                    on the ground that the latter were loans made by the partners whereas the
                    commission to the Temple was an expense. As for the outstanding management fee
                    due to Hok Mee, I was of the view that that should rank <em>pari
                        passu</em> with the said loans and advances in view of Hok Mee’s
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overpayment to Hok Chung</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In [39] of the Judgment, I had ordered Hok Chung
                    to refund $2,005,856.03 to the Partnership being the amount overpaid to it.
                    However I had not taken into consideration the fact that there should not have
                    been an omission of $50,000 (which was made by the Architects) for the minor
                    sewer works construction. Taking that into account, the refund should be reduced
                    by that sum to $1,955,856.03. I therefore order this reduced amount to be
                    refunded by Hok Chung to the Partnership instead. Hok Chung had made further
                    submissions on other reasons for reducing this sum further, all of which I
                    rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Corporate veil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In [44] of the Judgment, I had held that the
                    corporate veil should be lifted against Kek in respect of Hok Mee and Hok Chung.
                    I had found in [39] and [40] of the Judgment (as amended in this Addendum) that
                    the relevant losses were the sums of $1,955,856.03 and $1,572,816.72 due from
                    Hok Chung. Consistent with my finding in [44] of the Judgment, I order that Kek
                    be personally liable to the Partnership for these amounts, totalling
                    $3,528,672.75.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Kickback from AGA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In [50] of the Judgment I had ordered Hok Mee
                    to refund the kickback received from AGA of a sum amounting to $1,108,406.49.
                    This sum is incorrect and the correct amount is $358,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">$400,000 advance to the Temple</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In [55] of the Judgment, I had held that the
                    Temple was not liable to refund to the Partnership the sum of $400,000. This
                    money was advanced to the Temple at the time when the agreement between the
                    Partners was for the Temple to be entitled to a 25% profit share in return for
                    bearing the marketing costs. The explicit agreement in relation to the $400,000
                    when it was advanced by the Partnership to the Temple was that this would be set
                    off against the share of profit that the Temple would in due course receive.
                    However in [36] of the Judgment, I had found that this profit sharing agreement
                    was subsequently altered by the partners. Under the new agreement, which was not
                    in writing but evidenced by minutes of meetings, the Temple would be entitled to
                    a 15% commission on the sale of the niches, payable upon collection of sale
                    price. Indeed, consequent to this finding, I made a finding that the Temple was
                    entitled to a further sum of $1,000,000 by way of that 15% commission. There was
                    no evidence of any explicit agreement as to how the $400,000 was to be dealt
                    with upon this change of the agreement. However I find that it would be a
                    necessary implication from the altered agreement that the Temple would have to
                    repay the $400,000 as, under the new agreement, it was to bear the marketing
                    costs. Therefore I find the Temple liable to refund this $400,000 to the
                    Partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Priorities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In [76] of the Judgment, I had ordered the
                    remaining amounts in the Partnership Account, after the Temple has been fully
                    paid the sum of $281,200 pursuant to [74] of the Judgment and such expenses as
                    may be assessed by the Registrar pursuant to [75] of the Judgment, to be
                    distributed as follows: 36.235% to PLD, 52% to Hok Mee and 11.765% to the
                    Temple. However I had not taken into account the outstanding debts owed by the
                    Partnership to PLD, Hok Mee as well as Hok Chung. The parties are agreed that
                    PLD had advanced a total of $13,300,000 to the Partnership, Hok Mee had advanced
                    a total of $5,730,000 and Hok Chung a total of $286,000. Therefore the order in
                    [76] of the Judgment is to include such payments before any distribution to the
                    Partners. In the event that there is insufficient funds to repay these three
                    creditors in full, they rank <em>pari passu</em> as the
                    Joint Venture Agreements do not provide for any priority of
                payment.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">In the event that the assessed damages do not exceed $122,600, the
                    Temple shall have to pay the net figure to the Partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Kek, Hok Mee and Hok Chung are liable to pay,
                    on the basis of joint and several liability, the sum of $2,284,180 to the
                    Partnership. As PLD is entitled to this sum from the Partnership, it follows
                    that Kek, Hok Mee and Hok Chung ought to pay the sum of $2,284,180 to PLD and I
                    so order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the event that the damages assessed
                    pursuant to the order in [64] of the Judgment is less than $122,600, the Temple
                    shall pay such difference to the Partnership. Parties are at liberty to apply
                    for further orders in relation to any difference between the assessed damages
                    and the sum of $122,600.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In [72] of the Judgment, I had ordered the
                    Temple to pay $54,000 to PLD being money had and received. The Temple had
                    subsequently paid this sum to its solicitors as stakeholders and I order it to
                    be paid over to PLD forthwith.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the question of costs, I note that the
                    plaintiff, PLD, had succeeded in the bulk of the claims against Hok Mee, Kek and
                    Hok Chung which included breach of fiduciary duty and the corporate veil was
                    pierced. In my view, bearing in mind that there was a considerable degree of
                    overlap, the issue of the partnership dispute took up about two-thirds of the
                    trial and the issue of overpayments to Hok Chung took up about one-third. I
                    therefore order Hok Mee and Kek to pay PLD’s costs on the standard basis.
                    I also order Hok Chung to be jointly and severally liable for one-third of
                    PLD’s costs, in view of the reduced role of Hok Chung in the suit. I
                    further order Hok Mee and Kek to pay two-thirds of the costs of the Temple on
                    the standard basis. All costs are to be taxed unless agreed.</p>
