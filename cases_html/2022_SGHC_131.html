CIC was incorporated in May 2018, as a joint venture between three parties, including Zall Smartcomm (“Zall”). Zall operates a leading business-to-business platform in China and has launched other online transaction and service platforms around the world.

The parties broadly agree that the purpose of such relationship was for Mako to assist CIC in developing its business in the Indonesian market. However, on CIC’s case, the defendants were the ones who pitched the idea of assisting CIC with developing its presence in the Indonesian commodities market;

</div> It therefore needed to find ways to promote usage of the Platform on its own. The key strategy it intended to employ to achieve this was, first, to network with players in the commodities trading industry. CIC would then to use this network to encourage usage of its Platform. To this end, CIC was keen on participating in physical, back-to-back trades between suppliers in the region, particularly in Indonesia, and end-buyers in China. It was of the view that such physical trades would increase its exposure in the commodities trading industry, and, accordingly, help it to market the Platform.

</div> To this end, CIC cites the same three facts above, but in lieu of the Service Agreement – to which Jonathan and Wayne were not parties – CIC relies on the fact that in November 2018, Wayne asked for name cards to be issued to him and Jonathan. More specifically, he requested that CIC print his and Jonathan’s personal email addresses on these name cards, as opposed to email addresses tied to Mako. CIC did ultimately issue such name cards, identifying Jonathan and Wayne as a “Director” and “Deputy Director” of CIC, respectively.

It bears noting that Mako did not enter into the Transaction for and on behalf of CIC. CIC admits that Mako did not have “any authority to enter into or execute any agreement on [its] behalf”.

</div>
</div> Thus, although the trade was sourced by Mako, the contracts in the Transaction were signed <span class="font-italic">by</span><span class="font-italic"> employees of CIC</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the first leg of the Transaction, CIC contracted to purchase, on an FOB basis, 55,000 wet metric tonnes (“WMT”) of nickel ore containing at least 1.65% nickel. After some back-and-forth, the supplier of the nickel ore ended up being an Indonesian company called PT Toshida Indonesia (“Toshida”) (I will refer to the contract between them as the “CIC-Toshida Contract”). I pause to highlight that the parties dispute the circumstances leading up to the formation of the CIC-Toshida Contract. I will address the necessary aspects of their dispute in due course. For now, I note that prior to the formation of the CIC-Toshida Contract, the supplier that Mako recommended was one PT Integra Mining Nusantara (“Integra”). A contract between CIC and Integra was executed for the supply of the nickel ore (the “CIC-Integra Contract”), but this was later replaced with the CIC-Toshida Contract when it came to light that Integra’s export licence would expire before the date on which the cargo could likely be shipped out of Indonesia. In the second leg of the Transaction, CIC contracted on a CIF basis to sell the cargo to CPAG for a profit (the “CIC-CPAG Contract”). CPAG was also a middleman; so, in the third leg of the Transaction, CPAG was contracted to sell the cargo to the ultimate buyer, a Chinese company called Guangdong Guangqing Metal Technology Co Ltd (“GGMT”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Transaction, unfortunately, ran into difficulties. There were delays in the loading and shipping of the cargo, which contained an insufficient quantity of ore and failed to meet specifications. The shipped cargo only contained 37,408 WMT of ore and it was certified to contain just 1.43% nickel. These problems caused CIC to suffer the following losses: (a) the wasted part-payment it made to Toshida for cargo which failed to meet specifications; (b) the cost of freight it incurred to deliver the ore to CPAG in China; (c) the dead freight it incurred as a result of unutilised freight space; (d) demurrage from delays in the loading and shipping; and (e) payment it had to make to CPAG to satisfy an arbitral award made in CPAG’s favour as a result of CIC’s failure to provide cargo which met the specifications of the CIC-CPAG Contract.

Naturally, this begs the question as to why CIC has not taken the commercially simpler course, and sued Toshida. Indeed, most of the above losses flow directly from the failure of the cargo to meet specifications. By contrast, to hold the defendants liable for the same losses, CIC needs to rely on causes of action which are obviously more challenging to establish. On this, I should highlight that CIC did, on 15 October 2019, file a notice of arbitration against Toshida.

</div> However, CIC has concerns that any award it might be able to obtain would be unenforceable. This risk of unenforceability, CIC pleads, is also attributable to the defendants – specifically, their failure to ensure that: (a) the CIC-Toshida Contract was recorded in Bahasa Indonesia; and (b) the arbitration clause in this contract was valid.

</div> The first failing allegedly renders the contract null and void as a matter of Indonesian law. So, even if it is able to successfully obtain an arbitral award against Toshida, this would not be enforceable in Indonesia. The defendants’ second failing is also said to have a bearing on the enforceability of any arbitral award CIC might be able to obtain against Toshida.

</div> That is, Mako’s role was simply to introduce commodities suppliers in Indonesia to CIC, which was to decide for itself whether to participate in back-to-back trades with end-buyers it found. It was not Mako’s responsibility to procure and enter whole deals for CIC, much less to do so assiduously and loyally. As to Jonathan and Wayne, the defendants’ case is that they acted only as directors of Mako, and did not consent to being appointed as CIC’s agents personally.

Its essential complaint is that Jonathan and Wayne supressed the disclosure of their correspondence with various third parties as well as between themselves. Further, to explain their non-disclosure, they allegedly concocted unbelievable stories about how these correspondences have become irretrievable because their mobile phones have malfunctioned, were lost or damaged.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Putting aside the issue of whether the evidence bears out CIC’s claim, I decline even to consider this argument, raised <span class="font-italic">only</span> after the end of trial, for two reasons. First of all, I accept that it is possible for O 24 r 16(1) to be invoked at this stage of the proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Btech Engineering Pte Ltd v Novellers Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 171 (“<span class="font-italic">Btech</span>”) at [93]–[103]). However, given that striking out a defence (or a claim) is obviously significant, it is a point which should be pleaded – as a matter of fair notice – so as to put it into issue. This, in my view, is clear from Loh J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Btech</span> (see [97]). No such issue was placed before me, notwithstanding that CIC’s Statement of Claim was amended for a third time on 24 March 2021, after the start of trial, long after discovery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 My second reason for declining to consider CIC’s argument is its overly general character. On the basis that Jonathan and Wayne have refused to disclose their correspondence with third parties and between themselves, CIC submits that the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> defence should be struck out. Even if I accept its characterisation of the facts, this conclusion does not follow. CIC makes no argument as to how the lack of these correspondence bears on any of its many causes of action, and the importance of such precision can be seen from <span class="font-italic">Btech</span>. After determining that the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Btech</span> had deliberately suppressed certain documentary records, Loh J concluded: “Seeing as the documentary records would be relevant to [the defendant’s] counterclaim for the equipment and tools specifically, and not its other counterclaims, I do not think it would be fair to strike out [the plaintiff’s] defence to counterclaim <span class="font-italic">in toto</span>” (at [102]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I am mindful from <span class="font-italic">Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1 (at [6]) that the principle underlying the power in O 24 r 16(1) is the public interest in the administration of justice, specifically, ensuring that court orders are duly obeyed. This, however, needs to be weighed against the principle that a litigant should not ordinarily be denied the opportunity for his defence (or claim) to be considered on its merits. CIC’s broad argument that the entire defence should be struck out patently fails to strike this balance. I therefore dismiss its argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Wang is guilty of perjury</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I turn to the second issue. Essentially, CIC submits that I should disregard all the translations Mr Wang provided as well as his oral testimony on the basis that he has perjured himself. CIC makes four allegations in this regard. First, that Mr Wang lied in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), where he claimed to have <span class="font-italic">personally</span> translated all relevant documents. Second, that he continued to lie about this during cross-examination. Third, that he falsely testified that no translations had been provided to him together with the original documents. Lastly, that he also falsely testified that the defendants did not return any of the draft translations which he had prepared with amendments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 When Mr Wang took the stand for less than half a day, he was questioned only on the interpretations he put forth, and how he arrived at them.

Counsel for the defendants do not represent his interests, and it is simply Mr Wang who needs, and should have a chance to respond. Since CIC failed to accord him this opportunity, I cannot even begin to assess whether he is, as CIC boldly claims, “<span class="font-italic">guilty of perjury</span>”.

In short, CIC submits that <span class="font-italic">no</span> weight can be given to Wayne’s evidence because it is contrived to support Jonathan’s position. This submission rests on the “fundamental principle that [a] witness’s evidence must remain his own and cannot be supplanted by [that] of another” (citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA</span> [2018] 1 SLR 894 at [136] and [138]), and, to show that this principle has been breached, CIC makes three allegations.

In this case, Coomaraswamy J declined to accord any corroborative weight to the evidence of three plaintiff witnesses on the grounds that their accounts were “too clear, too categorical and too consistent” (at [56]). Many passages had been replicated verbatim or almost so (at [57]). In this light, the first defendant argued that there had been collusion in the preparation of the AEICs (at [58]). However, the judge observed that this submission went much further than necessary. Instead, it appeared to him that what happened was that the first plaintiff’s AEIC was drafted on his instructions, “in the usual way”. This draft was then used as a template for the AEICs of the three witnesses (at [59]–[60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 CIC submits that the impropriety which taints the preparation of Wayne’s AEIC is “far more egregious” than in <span class="font-italic">Jasviderbir</span><span class="font-italic"> Sing</span> because it does not merely replicate parts of Jonathan’s AEIC. Instead, it “purports to adopt and incorporate all matters in Jonathan’s AEIC”. He is, as such, not giving his own evidence, but rather parroting Jonathan’s evidence.

There, the three witnesses adduced AEICs which <span class="font-italic">appeared to</span> have been prepared by each of them independently. The discovery of their replication of many passages therefore cast doubt on the implied premise that the evidence affirmed was their own.

He had the benefit of reading Jonathan’s AEIC and recalling events through such lens. This certainly reduces the probative value which can be given to his evidence. However, the fact that Wayne prepared his AEIC in this way does not, contrary to CIC’s submission, deprive it of all evidential weight.

</div> (a) the fact that he and Jonathan prepared their AEICs together with their counsel; and (b) Wayne’s lack of familiarity, at trial, with the contents of his and Jonathan’s AEICs. I reject these submissions. One, while it is not ideal, it is not uncommon for AEICs to be prepared with some degree of proximity in time and space. As I explained above, this reduces the probative value of the evidence given, but it is not a fact which, alone, necessarily strips the evidence of any weight. Two, I accept that witnesses should be familiar with their evidence, but Jonathan and Wayne’s AEICs totalled almost 6,000 pages. I do not commend their hyper-cautious, over-inclusion of any and all documents, but I equally cannot expect Wayne to maintain a high degree of familiarity in the face of such voluminous records. This is especially so, given that the AEICs were affirmed in March 2021, and Wayne only gave evidence before me in September 2021, six months later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 CIC’s last point is that Wayne is heavily if not wholly reliant on Jonathan for the conduct and especially funding of his defence in this litigation.

</div>
</div> I accept this. However, in assessing the nature of CIC and Mako’s relationship, their written agreement is still necessarily the starting point. The terms of the agreement have been set out at [7]–[8] above. In its preamble, CIC is described as “委托方” (wěi tuō fāng), and Mako is described as “受托方” (shòu tuō fāng). In Mr Tan’s view, these should be read as “principal” and “trustee” respectively. In the first clause, Mako is described as “代理商” (dài lǐ shāng), which Mr Tan suggests should be translated as “agent”. Mr Wang proposes more neutral translations of “client”, “service provider” and “broker”, respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The parties’ reliance on these terms, however, is misplaced. It is trite that labels neither conclusively indicate nor preclude the existence of particular legal relationships, and this lack of certainty is exacerbated by the fact of the parties’ translation dispute. In fact, even if the dispute is set aside and I take CIC’s case at its highest, the labels which it prefers are still unhelpful. First, given Mr Tan’s translation of “受托方” as “trustee” as opposed to “fiduciary”, CIC only submits that it “entrusted” Mako under the Service Agreement.

</div> CIC does not claim that in entering the agreement, it and Mako specifically applied their minds to the question of whether Mako would be a fiduciary under the agreement. This being the case, the translation of “受托方” is largely unhelpful since whether or not CIC “entrusted” Mako, and the degree to which it did so, still needs to be proven by reference to the substantive terms of the Service Agreement and the full context of their relationship. Second, even if I accept that “代理商” means “agent”, the term is still notoriously broad and, as I will explain shortly, does not alone inform the actual obligations which the “agent” in question should be said to have owed. Therefore, it is not a question of whether I prefer Mr Tan or Mr Wang’s translations. Mako’s alleged status as a fiduciary is still an evaluative question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To answer this evaluative question, I begin with the aspects of the Service Agreement which are clear, regardless of whether I adopt Mr Tan or Mr Wang’s translation. These aspects will shed a clearer light on the substantive nature of CIC’s relationship with Mako.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it is clear that the objective of the Service Agreement was for Mako to develop CIC’s presence in the Indonesian commodities market. This is obvious from the first portion of cl 1, and the milestones of this general objective are also clearly set out in cl 4.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the methods by which Mako was to achieve this objective are also clear. As cll 1 and 4 of the Service Agreement shows, Mako was obliged to secure a certain number of customer registrations and matched trades on the Platform. Mako was also obliged to bring to CIC what Mr Tan calls “self-operating deals”. Mr Wang prefers the translation “actual trades involving CIC”, but the difference is not material. On either, it can be seen that the intention was to involve <span class="font-italic">CIC itself</span> in trade deals.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, it is also clear from the final sentence of cl 1 of the Service Agreement that Mako bore the responsibility for bringing <span class="font-italic">suppliers</span> into the picture, whilst CIC was responsible for finding <span class="font-italic">buyers</span>. Therefore, in carrying out a “self-operating deal” or a trade involving CIC, Mako’s job was to recommend a supplier from Indonesia, and CIC’s job was to find an end-buyer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This third point contradicts CIC’s case that Mako’s function under the Service Agreement was, generally, to procure trades. Thus, CIC disputes that the last sentence of cl 1 has any significance. During the cross-examination of Richard, it was put to him that Mako was just a broker obliged to introduce <span class="font-italic">sellers</span> to CIC. Richard disagreed and it is useful to quote his response in full:

</div>
</div> there is very little to suggest that Mako owed fiduciary duties just by virtue of its status as an “agent”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I am mindful that agents come in all shapes and sizes. A narrow scope of work, coupled with a lack of power to bind one’s principal to contracts does not necessarily mean that a person cannot be labelled an “agent”. However, as stated at [40] above, the label “agent” itself is unilluminating. CIC’s case is not that Mako was a purely ministerial agent, acting strictly on definitive instructions. Its case is that Mako was a <span class="font-italic">fiduciary</span> agent, and, given this, Mako’s lack of a power to unilaterally affect CIC’s position is salient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 This is because the absence of such power takes Mako’s position outside the paradigmatic definition of the term “agency”, which is best used “to connote an authority or capacity in one person <span class="font-italic">to create legal relations </span>between a person occupying the position of principal and third parties” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Scott v Davis</span> (2000) 204 CLR 333 at [227] (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Gummow J), which referenced the High Court of Australia’s earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">International Harvester Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Carrigan’s Hazeldene Pastoral Co</span> (1958) 100 CLR 644 at 652 (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Dixon J)). Both these cases are cited by Professor Tan Cheng Han SC in his work <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Tan</span>”) (at para 1.008), as a useful working definition of “agency” because, in his view, “a person who acts on behalf of another without the ability to affect the latter’s legal position may, in relation to the latter, have contractual rights and obligations, be capable of incurring tortious liability, and may also owe fiduciary obligations[,] but these fall within the usual scope of the law of contract, tort and equity respectively[,] to which the law of agency adds little if anything” (at para 1.007).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This definition also mirrors article 1(1) of the leading work in this area, Peter Watts and FMB Reynolds, <span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 22nd Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds</span>”) (at para 1-001) (cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Haringey v Ahmed and another</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 1861 (“<span class="font-italic">Haringey </span><span class="font-italic">v Ahmed</span>”) at [27]–[28] and also see <span class="font-italic">UBS AG (London Branch) v Kommunale Wasserwerke Leipzig GmbH</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 1567 (“<span class="font-italic">UBS v Kommunale</span>”) at [91]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Agency is the fiduciary relationship which exists between two persons, one of whom expressly or impliedly manifests assent that the other should act on his behalf <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">so as to affect his legal relations with third parties</span>, and the other of whom similarly manifests assent so to act or so acts pursuant to the manifestation. The one on whose behalf the act or acts are to be done is called the principal. The one who is to act is called the agent. Any person other than the principal and the agent may be referred to as a third party.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Although this definition does not reflect the full range of persons which can fairly be described as “agents”, what it does describe is the<span class="font-italic"> paradigm agent</span>, which can be presumed to owe fiduciary obligations, unless such presumption is rebutted. These are the duties of loyalty and to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of the principal (I will simply refer to this as the “duty of good faith”) (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee and Steven Elliott gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell</span>”) at paras 7-008–7-010; <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Mothew</span> [1998] Ch 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Mothew</span>”) at 18A–18C; <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1199 at [253]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On this, I note that the imposition of fiduciary duties on “agents” tends to be the source of some confusion. It is often assumed that “agency”, however broadly defined, is a settled category of fiduciary relationships. However, as Marcus Smith J aptly observed in <span class="font-italic">Pengelly v Business Mortgage Finance 4 plc </span>[2021] 1 All ER (Comm) 1191, “if the concept of agency is a wide-ranging and indeterminate one, then to say that all agents are fiduciaries is likely to be wrong” (at [34]). Non-paradigm agents <span class="font-italic">may</span> well be fiduciaries, but, as <span class="font-italic">Tan</span>, <span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds</span>, <span class="font-italic">Haringey v Ahmed</span> and <span class="font-italic">UBS v Kommunale</span> show, our intuitive sense that “agency” presumptively entails the imposition of fiduciary obligations relates specifically to agents with the power to change their principals’ legal position. That is, to bind the principal to contracts; to dispose of the principal’s property; and generally, to expose the principal to liability. This is not the only characteristic of a fiduciary, or even necessarily a definitive one, but it is a strong <span class="font-italic">indicium</span> because it places the party liable to have his legal position changed in a uniquely vulnerable position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 A party to a typical contractual relationship has to bear the risk that his counterparty might act in breach of contract and cause him loss. He also has to bear the risk that external forces outside his control may render his contractual bargain unperformable, otiose or otherwise unprofitable. These are <span class="font-italic">external risks</span> which the contracting party may ameliorate, whether by the contractual bargain itself, insurance, or simply by taking practical steps to ensure his counterparty performs. By contrast, a party who grants discretionary power to another person to legally act on his behalf has to bear an <span class="font-italic">internal risk</span> that his representative may exercise such power to bind him to a detrimental position. This risk is inherent to the very conferral of discretionary powers, and it is not easily mitigated. In fact, even if the representative exercises his powers illegitimately, doctrines such as the defence of <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser for value without notice and ostensible authority exist specifically to secure commercial certainty and protect third parties in dealings with such representatives. And, in respect of the latter, cases like <span class="font-italic">First Energy (UK) Ltd v Hungarian International Bank Ltd</span> [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 194 show how far the law can go to prefer the interests of the third parties over those of the grantor of the power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the face of this, the imposition of onerous fiduciary obligations over the exercise of powers is justified and necessary to mitigate at least some of the internal risks the grantor faces, by deterring the grantee from abusing his powers (deterrence is a well-established purpose for imposition of fiduciary duties: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the discussion in Matthew Conaglen, <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Loyalty</span><span class="font-italic">: Protecting the Due Performance of Non-Fiduciary Duties</span> (Hart Publishing, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Loyalty</span>”) at pp 61–76). Conversely, absent such an internal risk (and the powers which create such risk in the first place), the impetus for the imposition of such onerous obligations is rather substantially minimised, at least in the context of representative relationships. Therefore, to use the words of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd v Yeo Boong Hua</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 at [43], I do not think there is a “strong, but rebuttable, presumption” that an “agent” who lacks the power to alter his principal’s legal position owes fiduciary duties as one of the relationships within the “settled categories”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Returning to the present case, it is a clear conclusion that Mako was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a paradigm agent with the power to affect CIC’s legal relations with third parties. As such, I will not presume that Mako was a fiduciary. That said, this does not entirely preclude such a conclusion. As<span class="font-italic"> </span>the authors of <span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds</span> state in their article 1(4) (at para 1-001):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person may have the same fiduciary relationship with a principal where that person acts on behalf of that principal but has no authority to affect the principal’s relations with third parties. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Because of the fiduciary relationship such a person may also be called an agent</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The authors call these “canvassing” or “introducing” agents and suggest that such agents <span class="font-italic">may</span> also owe fiduciary duties (at para 1-020). However, the last sentence of article 1(4) suggests clearly that it is not <span class="font-italic">because of</span> their “agency” that they owe fiduciary duties. But, rather, <span class="font-italic">it is because they owe fiduciary duties</span> that they are regarded as “agents” in a legally meaningful sense. For these types of “agents”, as can be gathered from <span class="font-italic">Tan’s</span> suggestion (see [46] above), we ought to turn to the applicable principles in equity directly because the law of agency adds little, if anything, to the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This being the case, the inquiry should be focused on whether the person is an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary on the usual metrics. The starting point for this inquiry is <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan and another and other appeals</span> [2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the court stated that a fiduciary relationship can be said to arise if the putative fiduciary “voluntarily places himself in a position where the law can subjectively impute an intention on his … part to undertake [the fiduciary duties]” (at [194]). To lend this statement more particularity, reference can be made to <span class="font-italic">Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>”). Here, the court regarded three factors set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith</span> [1987] 2 SCR 99 as “helpful” in determining whether the imputation of such an intention is appropriate (at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Relationships in which fiduciary obligations have been imposed seem to possess three general characteristics:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the fiduciary holding the discretion or power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Useful and additional guidance can be found south of <span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Burdett v Miller</span>, 957 F.2d 1375 (7th Cir 1992), the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was tasked with analysing the nature of the relationship between a retail investor, one Ms Burdett, and Mr Miller, the owner and operator of an accounting firm who was also a professor of accounting. Delivering the opinion of the court, the eminent Judge Richard Posner said: “where a person solicits another to trust him in matters in which he represents himself to be expert as well as trustworthy[,] and the other is not expert and accepts the offer and reposes complete trust in him, a fiduciary relation is established” (at 1381). He then goes on to qualify this view: “We have emphasized knowledge and expertise but we do not mean to suggest that every expert is automatically a fiduciary. <span class="font-italic">A fiduciary relation arises only if ‘one person has reposed trust and confidence in another who thereby gains influence and superiority over the other’</span>” [emphasis added]. Applying this view, the judge went on to conclude that Mr Miller <span class="font-italic">was</span> a fiduciary because he “cultivated a relation of trust with Burdett over a period of years, holding himself out as an expert in a field (investments) in which she was inexperienced and unsophisticated”. Mr Miller was also aware that Ms Burdett “took his advice uncritically and unquestioningly and that she sought no ‘second opinion’… [she did not even ask for] any documentary confirmation of the investments to which he steered her”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I should state that Judge Posner’s approach towards identifying <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary relationships is far from definitive. Like <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith</span>, it only calls to attention certain characteristics which <span class="font-italic">might</span> affect the conclusion. As Professor Conaglen observes in his chapter on fiduciaries in <span class="font-italic">Snell</span>, the courts have generally avoided pinning down the facts which justify the imposition of fiduciary duties, preferring instead to preserve some flexibility in the approach to this inquiry (see <span class="font-italic">Snell</span> at para 7-005; <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [192]). Many scholars, including Conaglen himself (see <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Loyalty</span>, ch 9), have offered suggestions on how to assess the existence of fiduciary relationships, but none, as he admits in <span class="font-italic">Snell</span>, “[have] garnered universal support”. Therefore, the best which can be done, until an effective theory of fiduciaries is formulated <span class="font-italic">and accepted</span>, is to take into account the relevant considerations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This brings me back to the present case. CIC submits that, despite Mako’s lack of authority to execute contracts on its behalf, it still had a “wide scope of authority (actual or implied) in relation to procuring, structuring and execution of the [Transaction]”. So much so that CIC relied wholly on Mako to:

As stated at [41(c)]–[43] above, CIC has not shown that cl 1 of the Service Agreement ought not be read as an error or otherwise non-binding. By the contract CIC <span class="font-italic">itself</span> drafted, it was responsible for finding buyers for its back-to-back trades. It therefore cannot even be said that CIC relied on Mako to identify buyers, much less that it reposed trust in Mako in this exercise. Indeed, the correspondence between Richard and Wayne shows that CIC did look for buyers.

</div> not because doing so was a task which CIC had “relied entirely” on Mako to carry out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This just leaves Mako’s obligation to identify suppliers. I accept that CIC relied on Mako to source for reliable suppliers; however, this does very little to support the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the two. CIC’s reliance on Mako to do a good job in this regard is wholly protected by the imposition of an ordinary duty of care and skill. As stated at [5] above, the purpose of Service Agreement was to increase CIC’s exposure in the commodities trading industry so as to enable it to better market the Platform. There is nothing about this purpose that logically requires Mako to perform its functions under the Service Agreement with undivided loyalty and in good faith, beyond care and skill.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Further, the character of CIC’s reliance on Mako was also not indicative of any imbalance in expertise (see <span class="font-italic">Burdett v Miller</span> at [54] above) or vulnerability (see <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span> at [53] above) which supports the imposition of fiduciary duties. CIC’s lack of expertise was not so great as to prevent it from exercising its own judgment over the suppliers recommended by Mako. I accept that CIC’s officers were not experienced with commodities trading in Indonesia. However, Richard, who was Mako’s main contact with CIC, had more than four years of experience as a “Senior Executive, Trader” in Sumitomo Corporation in Asia &amp; Oceania, a trading and investment company, before he joined CIC. In this capacity, Richard “manage[d] existing clients’ account[s] and expand[ed] operations and sales of inorganic [and] functional chemicals (electronic chemicals) to the market”.

Instead, it was a commercial risk it chose to take.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On this, I should add that misplacing trust in a contractual counterparty to guard one’s interests does not elevate that counterparty’s status to that of a fiduciary.

On my analysis above, CIC did not need to rely on Mako, and the evidence also shows that CIC eagerly chose to trust Mako of its own informed volition, not in circumstances akin to <span class="font-italic">Burdett v Miller</span>. This then brings me back to the Slides and Indicative List of Deals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As mentioned at [6] above, it is CIC’s case that Mako put forward these two documents to persuade CIC of its expertise in the Indonesian commodities market. On Richard’s evidence, Jonathan and Wayne (and by extension, Mako) overstated their experience in these documents, in particular, the Indicative List of Deals which he testifies contained trades with which the defendants had never been involved.

</div>
</div> The purpose of this was to provide CIC with information relating to historical commodities trades, so that CIC could populate the Platform with false but believable trade deals ahead of the platform’s launch in Shanghai on 5 November 2018. Therefore, the defendants point out, a total of 19 templates were sent to Richard between 30 October and 21 November 2018, which went past the date on which the Service Agreement was executed by the parties (either 13 or 16 November 2018).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On balance, I find that the defendants’ account is to be preferred for two key reasons. First, the documents continued to be provided by Wayne after the Service Agreement had been signed and entered. If the Indicative List of Deals had been prepared by Jonathan and Wayne for the purpose of persuading CIC to enter into the Service Agreement, there is no reason for this. When Richard was questioned about this during cross-examination, his explanation was that even though the Service Agreement had been signed, CIC was still “assess[ing] their ability”.

</div> I find this difficult to accept on the logic of CIC’s own case. CIC was either satisfied with Mako’s credentials or it was not. If CIC was as cautious as it claims, it would have carried out all credential reviews before signing the Service Agreement. In any case, the objective evidence – in the form of the messages exchanged between Richard and Wayne – shows clearly that the information was being put up on the Platform to boost its apparent utilisation.

Whilst on the stand, he was evasive, often resorting to the unbelievable claim that he “did not know” when confronted with the objective evidence. For example, when it was put to him that he had sought trade information from Jonathan and Wayne to “beef up” the numbers on the Platform ahead of its launch in Shanghai, his response was: “Beef up. I -- I can’t remember, but -- but anyway, this request is from Zhang Jun [the CIC employee in-charge of the Platform] I really -- I don’t really take -- paying too much attention to it. Anyway, this -- that was not my scope”.

</div> The incoherence of this answer to a relatively simple question, in the face of the objective evidence placed before me, casts considerable doubt in my mind as to the veracity of Richard’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The analytical consequence of this finding is significant. First and most importantly, it substantially minimises the factual premises supporting the claim that Mako falsely induced CIC to enter the Service Agreement and place trust in it. Second, when coupled with the experience that Richard and Mark had (at [59] above), it becomes clear that CIC was not the babe in the woods it claims to be. It knew how to maximise its relationship with Mako to create the impression that the Platform was more actively used than it was, so as to launch the product more effectively in Shanghai. Lastly, these points suggest that CIC and Mako were on a relatively equal footing, supporting my conclusion that there was no great imbalance in expertise or any vulnerability indicative of a fiduciary relationship (see [59] above). In fact, at one point in his correspondence with Wayne, Richard describes their relationship as a “collaboration”,

There is evidence to show that CIC did (and therefore knew how to) review its own contracts.

</div> – suggests that they would have had enough business acumen to know to seek legal advice as necessary. On this, I must emphasise that even if Jonathan and Wayne had experience with the Indonesian commodities trade, they were not legally trained, nor is it CIC’s case that they had made representations to such effect.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As regards the fourth point, even if CIC acted unquestioningly in accordance with Mako’s recommendations, I do not accept that this as an <span class="font-italic">indicium</span> which supports the existence of a fiduciary relationship. It first needs to be asked <span class="font-italic">why</span> CIC acted in this way, and, in view of my findings above, the answer to this question seems to be that CIC failed to exercise sufficient oversight of its own commercial affairs. As I suggested at [59] above, CIC was not so ill-informed of the industry such that it could not even have exercised oversight. The dynamic in this case should thus be sharply distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Burdett v Miller</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As to the second factor at [56] above, it is clear that Mako (via Jonathan and Wayne) communicated with third parties in connection with the Transaction. The defendants do not dispute this. This fact, however, is neither here nor there in so far as it relates to Mako’s status as an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary. First, there is no evidence to show that Mako had the authority on CIC’s behalf to make binding representations, compromise matters, negotiate terms, or otherwise affect CIC’s position by its communications. And, when coupled with the fact that Mako had no authority to enter into contracts, Mako’s role seems more to be in the spirit of a messenger or coordinator than a representative of <span class="font-italic">CIC</span>. Second, it is not tenable to infer from the fact of Mako’s communications with third parties that it was in a position which justified the imposition of fiduciary duties (<span class="font-italic">per</span> the threshold in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> set out at [53] above). It is not in my view uncommon for commercial parties to communicate with a new business contact through the party connecting them. Unless there is something about such intermediating that discloses any of the factors in <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>, this fact does not take CIC far.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the round, the relationship between CIC and Mako seems to me to be one exclusively grounded in contract. While it is not impossible for a commercial counterparty to also be a fiduciary, the nature of the parties’ relationship in this case does not support that conclusion. In fact, beyond the deficiencies in CIC’s positive case, there is also strong negative argument against it. If Mako was a fiduciary pursuant to the Service Agreement, the foremost consequence is that Mako would owe a duty of undivided loyalty to CIC in connection with its job to recommend reliable buyers and sellers. It would then have been obliged to bring <span class="font-italic">all</span> available deals to CIC for it to have the opportunity to reject taking up such a deal (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Bhullar v Bhullar</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 424). Mako would not even have been able to enter physical trades on its own part without obtaining CIC’s informed consent. This plainly goes far beyond what parties intended by their self-described “collaboration” (see [64] above), and thus also cuts against the imputation of a subjective intention on the part of Mako to assume fiduciary obligations (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [53] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">CIC’s relationship with Jonathan and Wayne</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I turn next to consider CIC’s relationship with Jonathan and Wayne. As stated at [10] above, CIC’s case is that Jonathan and Wayne were also its agents in their own capacities, and thus, owed it the same fiduciary and other obligations it claims Mako owed. Having found that Mako was not CIC’s agent or fiduciary, this aspect of CIC’s case essentially falls away. However, I will briefly discuss the key factual basis on which CIC avers that Jonathan and Wayne became its agents in their personal capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 CIC’s case is basically that Jonathan and Wayne asked for, and were given CIC name cards on or around 29 November 2018. On Richard’s evidence, they requested the name cards so as to be able to represent CIC and negotiate contracts with prospective trading counterparties on CIC’s behalf.

</div>
</div> I accept this explanation. As I will discuss from [145]–[146] below, Mako had business beyond CIC, and it is reasonable that Jonathan and Wayne would have wanted to bring their relevant customers’ attention specifically and separately to CIC’s business as distinct from Mako’s. After all, this was the very purpose of the Service Agreement, even on CIC’s case (see [5] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, and in any event, CIC’s submission that Jonathan and Wayne were empowered to enter into contracts on behalf of CIC stands in stark contrast with CIC’s admission that Mako was not empowered to contract on its behalf.

</div> CIC’s formal agreement was with Mako, yet even then, it accepts that Mako did not have any contracting powers. It is wholly unexplained why CIC would then empower Jonathan and Wayne to enter and execute contracts on its behalf, in their personal capacities without a formal agreement. Further, it is unclear how CIC intended to distinguish between Jonathan and Wayne acting as directors of Mako without the power to bind CIC, and in their personal capacities with such power. In my view, it is unlikely that CIC had such intention, and this peculiarity only arises because CIC seeks to imbue Jonathan and Wayne’s rather innocuous act of requesting for name cards with too much significance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I therefore reject CIC’s claim that Jonathan and Wayne, in their personal capacities, were its “agents”. Instead, they were acting in their capacities as directors of Mako, and it therefore follows that they did not personally owe CIC duties. In this regard, I should also point out that from [139]–[152] below, I will address CIC’s submission that Mako’s corporate veil should be pierced to hold Jonathan and Wayne personally liable. My rejection of the factors on which CIC relies in making this submission further shows that its attempt to characterise Jonathan and Wayne as acting in their personal capacities is bereft of any factual basis. I will therefore only consider CIC’s case in so far as it pertains to the duties <span class="font-italic">Mako</span> owed CIC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Obligation(s) owed by Mako to CIC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 With the above findings in mind, I turn to the duties owed by Mako.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Duties of good faith and loyalty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I have found that Mako was not a fiduciary to CIC, whether by virtue of being an “agent” or on the facts.

</div> Because of this, there is simply no cogent justification for me to imply these duties into the Service Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Further, there is a second, more conceptually potent reason for rejecting CIC’s argument. The final step of the test in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> requires the court to consider whether an officious bystander would say, “oh, of course!”, if asked whether the proposed implied terms ought to constitute a part of the contract in question. In my view, however, the hypothetical bystander could only respond in this way – in so far as the duties of good faith and loyalty are concerned – if the contract, first and foremost, obviously creates one of the “settled” categories of relationships giving rise to fiduciary obligations. For example, the relationship between a solicitor and his client, a paradigm agent and his principal, or a trustee and his beneficiary. Accepting any view less strict than this will have the effect of expanding the existence of fiduciary relationships.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Professor Paul Desmond Finn, in his seminal work <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Obligations</span> (The Law Book Company, 1977), famously remarked that the conclusion that an individual is a “fiduciary” is “unimportant”. He explained, “[i]t is not because a person is a ‘fiduciary’ or a ‘confidant’ that a rule applies to him. It is because a particular rule applies to him that he is a fiduciary or confidant for its purposes” (at p 2) (an observation which the Court of Appeal approved in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [193]). Accordingly, if – in the face of my conclusion that Mako was not a fiduciary to CIC – I nevertheless find that duties of good faith and loyalty should be implied into the Service Agreement, that would be to contradictorily conclude that Mako was <span class="font-italic">in truth</span> a fiduciary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I am mindful that it is not necessarily impermissible for such duties to exist, in parallel, both or either in contract or equity. However, CIC’s basic case is that Mako was its <span class="font-italic">fiduciary</span>, and, as I mentioned at [55] above that there is no universally accepted approach, or list of considerations, for determining whether fiduciary duties exist. Given the obvious difficulty surrounding this area of law, it would be slightly foolhardy to think that the persistent challenge of identifying the existence of fiduciary relationships may be resolved simply by applying a test designed to ascertain implied terms. I therefore find that Mako did not owe CIC duties of good faith and loyalty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Duty to advise and provide information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In closing submissions, CIC argues that Mako had a duty “not to mislead CIC or misrepresent to CIC any matter in relation to the Transaction and <span class="font-italic">to advise</span> and <span class="font-italic">provide timely and accurate information</span> relating to all aspects of the Transaction to CIC” [emphasis added].

</div> As I have found that Mako was not a fiduciary, I need not consider this ground. As regards the latter two grounds, CIC’s case is confused and unnecessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I begin with the second ground, which I am prepared to consider on the basis that Mako was an “agent”, for whatever this is worth in terms of imposing consequential legal obligations. Even on this basis, however, if one consults the standard texts on agency, it will be seen that no author speaks of an agent owing – by virtue of their “status” as “agent” – a “duty not to mislead or misrepresent”: see <span class="font-italic">Tan</span>, ch 7; <span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds</span>, ch 6; Roderick Munday, <span class="font-italic">Agency: Law and Principles</span> (OUP, 4th Ed, 2022), ch 8. The reason for this is quite simple and connected to why CIC’s third ground also fails. The law of torts already offers recourse in respect of losses suffered as a result of actionable misrepresentations. This cuts across all representors, irrespective of whether they are “agents”, and so, there is no need for a “duty not to mislead or misrepresent” to be additionally imposed on “agents”, whether as a freestanding duty or by implication. Indeed, if <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> is applied, it is hard to see what “gap” would be filled by the implication of such a duty. Accordingly, I will only consider CIC’s case in misrepresentation on the tortious basis which it has pleaded as a separate cause of action (see [123]–[131] below).

In any event, it is not even clear whether treating such a duty as existing “in equity” engenders any meaningful distinction from treating it as a duty owed in contract or tort (see <span class="font-italic">Mothew</span> at 17G–H; although, for a recent survey of the authorities and authors favouring the opposite view, see Weiming Tan, “Peering through equity’s prism: A fiduciary’s duty of care or a fiduciary duty of care?” (2021) 15 Journal of Equity 181–202).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In respect of the other bases, it seems a trite conclusion that Mako owed CIC a duty of care and skill in performing the Service Agreement. As a matter of contract, Mako’s obligation to recommend suppliers was undertaken with the objective of developing CIC’s presence in the Indonesian commodities market. In carrying out this obligation, it is obvious that Mako was required to do so with due care and skill. In tort, CIC and Mako were clearly in sufficient proximity to give rise to a duty of care and skill as well; and I see no policy objections to the conclusion that Mako owed such a duty to CIC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I note that the respective scopes of Mako’s contractual and tortious duty could differ. However, CIC unfortunately does not make clear whether I should assess the facets of its claim in contract or tort. As such, this is not an issue I will address. Instead, from [88] below, I will simply consider CIC’s case by answering two basic factual questions which feature in all cases involving an alleged breach of a duty of care and skill. First, whether the scope of the duty owed extends to the relevant functions advanced by CIC. If Mako’s duty was not wide enough to cover those functions, it simply will not be liable for CIC’s losses. If Mako’s duty <span class="font-italic">was</span> wide enough, then, the next question is whether its conduct met the requisite standard of care.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Whether Mako breached its duty of care and skill</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Having found that CIC did not have a personal relationship with Jonathan and Wayne, and that the only duty Mako owed CIC was a duty of care and skill, I now turn to consider Issue 3: the scope of such duty; whether Mako breached this duty; and if so, the extent to which it is liable for CIC’s losses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Before doing so, however, it is important to state again that each facet of CIC’s case is premised on the breach of a host of distinct duties (see [17]–[18] above).

</div> I call attention to this because it is clear that these are distinct allegations which entail different inquiries. Whether Mako acted disloyally is an entirely different question from whether it failed to meet a particular standard of care. Yet, because of the over-inclusive approach CIC has taken, its submissions fail to address clearly how its account of the facts establish Mako’s breach of <span class="font-italic">each</span> duty. In fact, CIC’s submissions are not even consistent; in the concluding paragraph of its submissions on the first facet, CIC states that there was a clear breach of the “fiduciary duty to act honestly and in the best interests of CIC”.

The following demonstrates this.

Does it include the other two of six aspects it raises in connection with the defendants’ alleged “fiduciary duties”, or does it only include the four aspects it raises in connection with its action in negligence? If it does include those two aspects, what arguments should I then consider in determining whether the defendants met the standard of care expected of them?

As far as the Indonesian authorities are concerned, the nickel ore could either leave the port legally because it belonged to Toshida (as opposed to PT Sambas, CV Sambas or local Indonesian miners), or it could not. If I were to conclude that the CIC-Toshida Contract was illegal despite fact that the vessel was eventually allowed to leave the port, I would – at the very least – be making the suggestion that the Indonesian authorities erroneously allowed the cargo out of the country. However, when coupled with the basis on which CIC expects me to make this finding – that some US$25,000 had been paid to the Indonesian authorities so as to facilitate this – the suggestion is unavoidably that the authorities were bribed, and had illegally allowed the nickel ore cargo to leave Indonesia on that basis. I <span class="font-italic">firmly</span> reject this both as an allegation of fact, as well as a matter of international comity. If CIC had wished for me to make such a finding, this should have been made its <span class="font-italic">positive</span> case, and strong evidence should have been tendered to prove it true. The soft, non-committal basis on which CIC suggests I should reach the same effective conclusion is wholly inadequate.

</div> To bolster its case, CIC submits, with the benefit of hindsight, that the cargo and its supplier were evidently unreliable because the cargo failed to meet the specifications set out in the CIC-Toshida and CIC-CPAG Contracts. I do not accept this argument. Whether Mako should be held liable for its alleged failure to exercise due care in respect of its obligation to recommend suppliers to CIC turns on whether Mako fell short of the standard of care a reasonable man would exercise in performing this function. Inferring that Toshida was unreliable using hindsight in the matter submitted by CIC would be to unjustifiably make Mako the insurers of CIC’s venture.

In determining this, three subsidiary questions are relevant. First, what did Mako actually know about Toshida as a supplier and what should it reasonably have known. Second, with the knowledge Mako had or ought to have had about Toshida as a supplier, what steps would a reasonable person take in carrying out its function under the Service Agreement. Third, if the steps taken by Mako were not those which a reasonable person would have taken, whether CIC would have entered into the CIC-Toshida Contract in any event, that is, irrespective of anything done or not done by Mako. I point to the CIC-Toshida Contract specifically because it was ultimately the supplier of the nickel ore cargo. Even if, hypothetically, Mako had negligently recommended Integra to CIC as a supplier, determining that issue would be of no significance since the CIC-Integra Contract was not performed, and CIC did not suffer losses from its entry thereinto.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Turning then to the first question, Jonathan’s evidence is that neither he nor Wayne directly communicated with Toshida.

</div> Indeed, it appears that Jonathan and Wayne did not know much, if anything, about Toshida as a nickel ore supplier. Their own position is that Toshida only came into the picture when it came to light that Integra’s export quota would expire at a date before the likely completion of loading of the nickel ore cargo onto the chartered ship. In this regard, there were issues surrounding the chartering of the ship which caused certain delays in the vessel’s arrival at the relevant port in Indonesia. On this ground, the defendants’ position is that Simon recommended that the supplier be changed from Integra to Toshida, which had an export quota expiring slightly later.

</div> It is therefore unlikely that Mako conducted due diligence between the time of Simon’s recommendation and the time which Mako itself raised the issue of the change in supplier with CIC. Whatever due diligence it conducted, if any, could only have been done beforehand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 This brings me, then, to the second question. In my judgment, a reasonable person in the position of Mako would have done either one of two things. First, he would have taken some steps to ascertain whether Simon’s recommendation was reliable. Second, alternatively, given that CIC had already committed to the supply of nickel ore to CPAG and chartered a vessel, and the fact that there was some urgency to the identification of a suitable supplier to be able to meet the timeline for delivery under the CIC-CPAG Contract, a reasonable person would have called to CIC’s attention the fact that he had no personal experience with Toshida, but queried whether, in the circumstances, CIC was nonetheless willing to take the risk of entering the CIC-Toshida Contract, <span class="font-italic">or</span>, whether it would prefer to risk a delay while Toshida’s reliability was being assessed. Having considered the evidence, I find Mako did the former.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I accept Jonathan’s evidence that prior to CIC’s execution of the CIC-Toshida Contract, he and Jonathan met with the “boss” of a surveying company in Indonesia with the objective of establishing a connection and building their network of contacts. In this meeting, they queried about the suppliers with whom they should avoid, specifically raising both Integra and Toshida. They were told that these companies had “sufficient quota and cargo” and also, that “there was no adverse news in the market about them”.

On my reading, the imprecisely worded terms of the Service Agreement (see [7]–[8] above) do not accommodate such a narrow and specific duty, and, for substantially the same reasons as those stated at [76], I find that there is no basis for me to imply such a duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I turn then to the law of negligence to determine whether Mako owed a duty to exercise care and skill to ensure that CIC’s contracts were compliant with Indonesian law. In this regard, CIC accepts that Jonathan and Wayne were not legally trained. Instead, it relies on the fact that the two directors held themselves out as having “the requisite experience in the Indonesian commodities market and ought to have known that there were commercial risks” which would arise from these failures.

</div> After due consideration, I find that this is not a sufficient basis to impose on non-legally trained persons a duty of care which effectively requires them to: (a) have knowledge of specific laws, here particularly, foreign laws; (b) to then be able to identify legal issues and risk; and (c) to render advice on legal issues. In my judgment, public policy considerations at the second stage of the test in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 cut against the conclusion that a layperson can owe such a duty of care and skill.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The key policy considerations informing my decision is this. Almost all areas of modern commerce involve some issues of law or potential legal risks. It goes much too far to suggest that, if a person represents that he has commercial expertise in a particular industry, it necessarily follows that he is aware of attendant legal issues and risks, and further, that he appreciates that he should take reasonable care to ensure that those legal issues and risks are properly covered. To find that Mako owed such a duty on the mere basis of its representation of commercial expertise alone would, in my judgment, be to impose an equivalent duty on a substantial class of businessmen, against the reality of how the world of commerce operates. I am mindful, however, that this general view cannot be stated with too much force. It is certainly not wholly impermissible for a layperson to make clear and specific representations such that it would not be contrary to policy to impose on him a narrow duty of care to take reasonable measures to ensure that specific legal issues and risks do not surface. However, such a duty should only arise in cases where the obligor has done something to justify the imposition of such a duty. General representations as to commercial expertise are insufficient, and I accordingly find that Mako was not under a duty, as CIC asserts, to “ensure that the CIC-Toshida Contract [was] in [Bahasa Indonesia] and that the arbitral body under the dispute resolution clause exists and [was] valid”.

First, in closing, CIC submits that a “reasonable person exercising ordinary care and skill in the position of the Defendants would have engaged an Indonesian legal practitioner to ensure that the CIC-Toshida Contract was valid … under Indonesian law before committing CIC to [the Transaction]”.

</div> I reject this submission on four bases. One, as stated several times from [39]–[67] above, CIC admits that Mako did not have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of CIC. It follows from this that Mako could not have “committed” CIC to the Transaction. Two, I stated at [59] above that Richard and Mark had sufficient experience and should have had enough business acumen to determine for themselves whether to take legal advice, particularly foreign legal advice. Three, CIC’s watered-down claim that Mako should have engaged an Indonesian legal practitioner to ensure that the CIC-Toshida Contract was in order does not form a part of CIC’s pleaded case. Lastly, even if I were to consider CIC’s claim on the basis of this less onerous duty to seek legal advice, I found at [41(c)]–[44] that Mako’s function under the Service Agreement was, narrowly, to recommend suppliers to CIC. This being the case, the imposition of a duty of care and skill on Mako to ensure legal advice was sought would go against the grain of their Service Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Second, even if I were to assume that Mako owed a duty of care exactly as framed by CIC, there is at present no loss to which CIC can point to as being <span class="font-italic">caused</span> by Mako’s breach of the duty. CIC’s expert on Indonesian law, Professor Hikamahanto Juwana (“Prof Juwana”), testifies that the consequence of failing to translate a contract to Bahasa Indonesia has the effect of rendering the contract invalid and unenforceable. For this, he refers to a 2015 decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court (<span class="font-italic">Nine AM v </span><span class="font-italic">PT Bangun</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>1572 K/PDT/2015).

</div> Mr Senen disputes this conclusion on several bases, the most pertinent being that the rule of law requiring contracts to be recorded in Bahasa Indonesia has “little application” to the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award because, once the award has been rendered, enforcement is carried out by reference to the award, not the underlying agreement.

</div> Neither expert has fully convinced me of their position, and it is this uncertainty which explains why CIC cannot prove its loss. As CIC’s arbitration with Toshida has yet to conclude, it cannot be shown that CIC’s losses are causally connected to Mako’s assumed failure to ensure the CIC-Toshida Contract complied with Indonesian law.

Despite the majority of the trio’s exchanges being on WeChat, CIC did not refer me to any messages which showed such assurances.

Early on 11 December 2018, Richard sent to Jonathan and Wayne proposed amendments to CPAG’s issued letter of credit. These proposed amendments were then forwarded by Wayne to CPAG, whereupon CPAG took the view that, because the letter of credit was issued on a back-to-back basis, its terms could not be changed (presumably to be on the same terms as the letter of credit issued by CIC to the supplier, Toshida). After arriving at this conclusion, Wayne states that he would explain the matter to CIC.

</div> but they do not ask CIC to take the issue up with CPAG directly. CIC relies on this in its submissions to make the point that it is “disingenuous” for Mako to attempt to shift the responsibility for communicating with CPAG because “the fundamental premise [is] that CIC reposed trust and confidence in [Mako] … and relied on them to procure, structure and execute the [Transaction]”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It can be seen from this that CIC’s case that Mako owed a duty to ensure that CPAG’s letter of credit was compliant with the terms of the CIC-CPAG Contract rests, ultimately, on the premise that Mako was CIC’s fiduciary. As I have found at [67] above, Mako was not CIC’s fiduciary, and I do not think it appropriate to say that CIC <span class="font-italic">reposed</span> trust in Mako so much as it <span class="font-italic">misplaced</span> trust in it. This misplaced trust is insufficient, in my view, to create proximity between Mako and CIC in respect of this function. Therefore, to reiterate, I find that Mako did not owe CIC a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that CPAG’s letter of credit was issued in accordance with the terms of the CIC-CPAG Contract. In fact, for the same reasons, I find that Mako did not owe CIC a duty to ensure that it had a complete set of documents needed for presentation to CPAG’s issuing bank to obtain payment under CPAG’s letter of credit (CIC’s third allegation as set out at [115] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I turn next to the second, fourth and fifth allegations made by CIC against Mako (again, at [115] above), which may be dealt with more briefly.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As to CIC’s second allegation, I find that irrespective of whether Mako in fact caused the BL to be consigned “to order” instead of to the order of CIC’s issuing bank, CIC has failed to show how this caused the losses it suffered. The proprietary risks which this alleged breach would have created are not connected to any of the losses CIC pleads (see [13] above). Indeed, in written closing submissions, CIC submits that it was “significantly riskier” for the BL to made out “to order” with a blank endorsement. CIC does not then point to the manifestation of that risk.

On the basis that Mako did in fact procure CIC to provide a letter of indemnity on back-to-back terms with CPAG to authorise the discharge of the cargo to the ultimate-buyer GGMT, and that this was done in breach of Mako’s duty of care and skill, it is wholly unclear what losses CIC suffered as a result of such act. To the contrary, from the arbitral award made in favour of CPAG against CIC, it appears that the release of the cargo facilitated the mitigation of losses on the part of CPAG, which was accounted for in the award against CIC. Such mitigation was possible because CPAG could, at least, modify its contract with GGMT to on-sell the off-specification nickel ore for a lower price.

On the second and fourth allegations, I find that even if Mako had breached its duty of care, CIC has not proven the relevant losses it suffered as a result of such breaches. As to the final allegation, I find primarily that CIC has failed to establish as a matter of fact that they were obstructed from establishing contract with CPAG, GGMT or Intertek.

</div> I reject this contention. As I found at [97] above, CIC has not established that the cargo ultimately shipped did not belong to Toshida. The fact that the cargo was off-specification therefore has nothing to do with the reliability of PT Sambas as a supplier. The fourth representation, in my view, can also be dismissed for the reason that CIC has not satisfied me that the cargo shipped did not belong to Toshida. Implicit in the representation framed by CIC is the suggestion that the true supplier would be PT Sambas, which I have not accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I therefore dismiss CIC’s claim for misrepresentation in respect of these four representations on the basis that they were not false. It also bears reiterating, however, my finding at [57] above that CIC was the one who insisted on being interposed in back-to-back trades, which is what led Mako to recommend that it should consider participating in the Transaction. This, in my view, separately shows that even if the above four misrepresentations had been made, CIC – on balance – likely did not rely on them in deciding to enter into the contracts with Integra, Toshida and CPAG. CIC was extremely keen to participate in a back-to-back trade, and I find that it would have entered the Transaction once presented with the opportunity, irrespective of these four representations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">To induce CIC to replace the CIC-Integra Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In respect of this cause of action, CIC claims that Jonathan and Wayne made five representations to induce it to enter into CIC-Toshida Contract and, consequently, replace the CIC-Integra Contract.

</div> First, that Integra would not be able to export the nickel ore cargo as its export quota was expiring. Second, that, in order to meet the timelines for shipment, the CIC-Integra Contract had to be replaced with the CIC-Toshida Contract. This was because Toshida’s export quota was expiring at a later date and, as such, its export quota could be used to export the nickel ore originating from CV Sambas (or PT Sambas). Third, that Jonathan and Wayne had previously worked with Toshida. Fourth, that CIC did not have to be concerned about the counterparty to the supply contract because the cargo was the same (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in truth, supplied by CV Sambas to PT Sambas) and the terms of the CIC-Toshida Contract were the same as the terms of the CIC-Integra Contract.

</div> a crucial element which CIC must prove is that the conspirators acted with the “predominant purpose of causing damage” (see <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore</span>”) at [23]). As I found above, the defendants did not breach any aspect of their duty of care and skill. Thus, it can scarcely be maintained that they acted in a manner with such predominant purpose. Similarly, in relation to conspiracies carried out by <span class="font-italic">unlawful</span> means, the conspirators must have had the intention to cause damage or injury (see <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore</span> at [23]; <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [112]). Again, in light of the findings made, it cannot be sustained that the defendants possessed such intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Beyond the lack of evidence supporting CIC’s allegations, there seems to me to be three points which further undermine its case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, as mentioned at [132] above, the crux of CIC’s case is that the conspirators sought to interpose CIC to pass onto it the risks inherent in the Transaction. However, as I have found at [57], Mako did not seek to interpose CIC in the transaction. It was CIC who was eager to participate as an intermediary. This finding deprives CIC’s claim of a much-needed logical starting point.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it betrays common sense for Mako to have conspired with CPAG, Lei Jun and/or Chen Ye to harm CIC in this way. Mako was being paid to assist CIC, and as it submits, it stood to earn a commission from a successful trade.

</div> Having failed to establish that Mako was a fiduciary, this claim necessarily fails. I therefore dismiss this action on the grounds that no fiduciary relationship exists between CIC and Mako.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 However, even if I assume that: (a) Mako was a fiduciary; <span class="font-italic">and</span> (b) that it acted in breach of its fiduciary duties, CIC has not referred me to any evidence which meaningfully supports the conclusion that Jonathan and Wayne acted in a dishonest manner (as defined in <span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan</span> [1995] AC 378 (“<span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei</span>”) at 389; also see <span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III v Ho Chi Kwong</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 at [20]–[22]). Given CIC’s approach, I should emphasise that it is not<span class="font-italic"> </span>axiomatic that all breaches of fiduciary duty are dishonest. Such breaches can be committed quite honestly.

</div> Last, the facts suggest that no distinct lines were drawn between Mako’s finances on the one hand, and Jonathan or Wayne’s on the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Before I turn to consider these factors, I think it is meaningful to observe that there is, in general, a paucity of cases where the courts have “pierced the corporate veil”. There are a few usual examples, but it is not clear whether each and every one of these cases should be construed as an instance of the court’s necessary exercise of its specific power to “pierce the corporate veil”. This is as opposed to analysing them as decisions which show that the courts were, in fact, applying some other legal principle to the same end. Consider, for example, the well-known decisions of <span class="font-italic">Gilford Motor Co v Horne</span> [1933] Ch 935 (“<span class="font-italic">Gilford</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Jones v Lipman</span> [1962] 1 WLR 832 (“<span class="font-italic">Jones</span>”). In the seminal decision, <span class="font-italic">Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd and others </span>[2013] 2 AC 415 (“<span class="font-italic">Prest</span>”), Lord Sumption preferred to leave <span class="font-italic">Gilford</span> and <span class="font-italic">Jones</span> as cases in which the court actually decided to pierce the veil upon an application of his “evasion principle” (at [28]–[30]) (a summary of the approach espoused by Lord Sumption may be found in <span class="font-italic">Simgood Pte Ltd v MLC Shipbuilding Sdn Bhd and others</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1129 at [198]–[202]). Lord Neuberger, by contrast, took the view that these cases could have been resolved without such reference. He suggested that the injunction ordered against the company in <span class="font-italic">Gilford</span> could have been justified on the basis that it was Horne’s agent (at [71]–[72]). As regards the decision in <span class="font-italic">Jones</span>, Lord Neuberger thought that an order for specific performance against Lipman would have had the effect of compelling him to, in turn, compel the company to convey the property to the plaintiffs (at [73]). In this vein, his Lordship concluded with the view that there have been no cases which <span class="font-italic">needed</span> to rely on the doctrine that the court may pierce the corporate veil. He was not, however, prepared to declare that no such doctrine existed (at [79]–[80]). Lord Walker went even further and came quite close to denying the existence of the doctrine entirely. In his view, all cases – with the possible exception of the difficult decision of <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens</span> [2009] AC 1391 – could be explained by the application of other legal principles (at [106]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I am aware that the views expressed in <span class="font-italic">Prest</span> have yet to be considered, much less accepted here. The law stands as stated in <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo</span>. There, the apex court <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> upheld the judge’s decision to “pierce the corporate veil” on the “alter ego” ground (at [100]), and it is certainly not my place to rationalise decisions of a superior court. By this, I mean that it is not for me to query whether the breadth of the “alter ego” ground for piercing the corporate veil is framed by the “evasion principle” espoused by Lord Sumption, or whether its application is guided by some other narrower, wider or alternative legal principle the Court of Appeal may or may not have had in mind. Therefore, the most precise analysis which can be rendered is to examine closely the factual <span class="font-italic">indicia</span> which suggests that Mako was the “alter ego” of Jonathan and Wayne. That being said, I also observe that, though the precise principle guiding the application of the piercing doctrine in Singapore is not yet settled – indeed, even in <span class="font-italic">Prest</span>, it was a source of some strife between the judges – the overall weight of the jurisprudence and literature nevertheless tends towards the consistent view that the doctrine should only be applied in <span class="font-italic">limited</span> circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 On this note, I return to the four factors raised by CIC. In my view, even if CIC established any one of its causes of action against Mako, these factors do not justify piercing its corporate veil.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As CIC emphasises in its own submissions, where the alter ego ground is relied on, “the key question that must be asked whenever an argument of alter ego is raised is whether the company is carrying on the business of its controller” (<span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo</span> at [96]).

</div> In answering this <span class="font-italic">key</span> question, and deciding that the corporate veil ought to be pierced in that case, the Court of Appeal found relevant several factual <span class="font-italic">indicia</span>. First, the fact that the appellant incorporated the company for the sole purpose of receiving payment under the relevant agreement in that case. Second, the fact that the appellant was the only shareholder and director of the company, and admitted that the relevant company was under his control. Third, the fact that the appellant operated the company’s bank account as if it was his own, and admitted that this was the case (at [97]–[100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Similarly probative <span class="font-italic">indicia</span> are not present in this case. First of all, Mako was not incorporated solely to deal with CIC under the Service Agreement. The defendants point me to business and transactions which Mako undertook outside of the Service Agreement with CIC.

</div> <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mako and Yiwan. I turn next to Dalphy. I also do not accept that the contractual documents tendered by the defendants should be accorded no weight. The import of doing so would be to find, implicitly, that these documents are false, and that the defendants have entered into evidence forged documents which do not actually reflect Mako’s business. This is not a conclusion which I can reach lightly, and if it is CIC’s position that the documents do not reflect the true state of affairs they purport to, that should have been tested during cross-examination of either Jonathan or Wayne. I therefore find that CIC has failed to prove that Mako’s business with Dalphy was not genuine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 CIC also submits that whether or not Mako carried on business with other parties “is not determinative of the issue of alter ego”.

</div>
</div>
</div> This is, strictly speaking, correct. However, the fact that Mako <span class="font-italic">did</span> carry on business with other parties is quite deleterious to CIC’s case. Where the court is asked to look at a defendant company with <span class="font-italic">no business</span> other than with the plaintiff, it is considerably easier to conclude that the defendant company was only carrying on the business of its controller. With each additional business counterparty thrown into this mix, the conclusion becomes more difficult to reach. This is because it would require the plaintiff to <span class="font-italic">specifically distinguish</span> one contract or counterparty from the others, a task which requires very particular evidence which CIC does not have.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 This segues to my second point. Unlike the company in <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo</span>, Jonathan and Wayne are not the only directors of Mako. To address this obvious flaw in their case to pierce Mako’s corporate veil, CIC submits that there is no evidence to demonstrate that the other director of Mako was involved in decision-making and management. CIC makes the allegation, and its submission thus fails to appreciate that the burden of proof lies on it to satisfy the court that the other director sat on the board of Mako in name only and no more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Third, I turn to CIC’s argument that the trading experience which Mako advertised it had, was that of Jonathan and Wayne <span class="font-italic">personally</span>, not transactions which it had entered into or procured on its own part. This argument is weak at best. I accept that the marketing was not strictly accurate, but this does little to show that Mako was only carrying on Jonathan and Wayne’s personal business. It is quite typical for a company in the business of providing a service, especially newly formed companies, to advertise the experience of the <span class="font-italic">individuals</span> in its employ, or on its board of directors. Those individuals can fairly and legitimately lend such experience in their capacity as employees or directors of the company. Indeed, CIC was doing exactly the same thing with regard to the Platform. To suggest otherwise would be contrary not only to common sense, but also the basic structure of such corporations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 My fourth and final point concerns the weight the court in <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo</span> gave to the fact that the appellant operated the company’s bank account as his own, and conversely, treated its dues as his own. Most pertinently, the court observed that the appellant procured payments that were due to the company, and directed that the payment of such dues be made to his personal account (at [99]). In what seems to be a similar vein, CIC submits that Jonathan and Wayne had “no qualms about assuming what [were] rightfully the financial obligations of Mako”.

There is little which can be inferred from the fact of payment alone. It may well be that, after such payment was made for Mako, a liability of US$80,000 was recorded in Mako’s accounts in Jonathan’s favour. That would clearly suggest that there was a distinction between <span class="font-italic">Jonathan</span> and <span class="font-italic">Mako’s</span> money. Conversely, if the payment had not been recorded, or had been written off, that could support CIC’s case.
