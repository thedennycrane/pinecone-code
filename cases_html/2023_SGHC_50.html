The starting point of the analysis is s 31(1) of the Copyright Act 1987 (2006 Rev Ed) (“Copyright Act”), which states that the copyright in a work is infringed if a person, who neither owns nor licenses the copyright, <span class="font-italic">does</span><span class="font-italic"> or authorises the doing</span> of any act comprised in the copyright. The liability arising from the authorisation of an infringing act is therefore separate from the liability arising from the infringing act itself: Gwilym Harbottle, Nicholas Caddick &amp; Uma Suthersanen, <span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James on Copyright</span> vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James</span>”) at para 7-273. As such, the Defendant is liable if (a) the Defendant is found to have carried out the infringing acts or (b) the Defendant is found to have authorised these acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On whether the Defendant may be said to have carried out the infringing acts, I note, as a starting point, that it is not disputed that the acts of copying were carried out by Mr Win. The question, then, is whether these acts may be attributed to the Defendant such that it is taken to have committed them itself. This turns on whether Mr Win was acting in the course of his duties as an agent of the Defendant (see <span class="font-italic">MCA Records Inc and </span><span class="font-italic">anor v Charly Records Ltd and ors</span> [2000] EMLR 743 at [10]–[11]) or in the exercise of specific powers found in the Defendant’s constitution or in general company law (see <span class="font-italic">Red Star Marine Consultants Pte Ltd v Personal Representatives of </span><span class="font-italic">Satwant Kaur d/o Sardara Singh, deceased and anor</span> [2020] 1 SLR 115 at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 There is no evidence before me which indicates that Mr Win’s acts were sanctioned by the exercise of powers in the Defendant’s constitution or in general company law, such as through a resolution by the Defendant’s directors or shareholders. I also accept the Defendant’s argument that Mr Win’s acts were not committed as an agent of the Defendant. The relationship of principal and agent arises by the express or implied conferring of authority by the principal on the agent: Peter Watts &amp; F.M.B. Reynolds, <span class="font-italic">Bowstead</span><span class="font-italic"> and Reynolds on Agency </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2021) at para 2-001. On the facts, Mr Win’s infringing acts cannot be said to fall within the scope of any such authority conferred upon him by the Defendant. This is evident from Mr Win’s signed acknowledgments of the Defendant’s anti-software piracy policy in 2015, which states that “[e]mployees are not allowed to install, download or use any unauthorized software onto company’s computers”.

</div> The Defendant had also licensed the relevant modules of the NX Software it required for its business. There was therefore no reason either for the Defendant to have exposed itself to unnecessary risk by instructing or allowing its employees to download unauthorised software which it did not need or for Mr Win to have expected such acts to fall within the scope of his work. For these reasons, I am satisfied that Mr Win’s infringing acts cannot be attributed to the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Turning to the point on “authorisation” under s 31(1) of the Copyright Act, this term has been interpreted to refer to the sanctioning, approving, or countenancing of the infringing use: <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng and ors v Lotus Development Corp and anor</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 113 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng</span>”) at [29]. It is the grant or the purported grant, which may be express or implied, of the right to do the act complained of. The Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 830 at [50] specified four factors which the courts ought to take into account in determining if authorisation liability should be imposed: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the alleged authoriser had control over the means by which copyright infringement was committed and, hence, a power to prevent such infringement (“the first authorisation liability factor”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The nature of the relationship (if any) between the alleged authoriser and the actual infringer (“the second authorisation liability factor”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the alleged authoriser took reasonable steps to prevent or avoid copyright infringement (“the third authorisation liability factor”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the alleged authoriser had actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence of copyright infringement and/or the likelihood of such infringement occurring (“the fourth authorisation liability factor”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The CA emphasised that these factors should be evaluated in their totality in the context of the factual matrix of each case. Proving “one or even several of these factors” will not be invariably decisive on the question of authorisation liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Applying the first authorisation liability factor, I find that the Defendant did not have the power to prevent Mr Win’s acts of infringement. While I accept that the Defendant may have facilitated the copyright infringement by way of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, its negligence in failing to account for the Lenovo Laptop and to install administrative controls onto it, the Defendant had essentially no control over what Mr Win did on the laptop. An analogy may be drawn with the facts in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng</span>. In that case, the appellant knowingly sold infringing copies of the software programme and the manuals for these programmes to the infringer, who was a dealer in unauthorised copies of computer products. The CA held that although the appellant “conferred on [the infringer] the power to copy or even encouraged [the infringer] to copy”, he ultimately had no control over the infringer’s actions: <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng </span>at [35]. Similarly, even if, accepting the Plaintiff’s arguments, the Defendant had facilitated Mr Win’s infringing acts by creating “the very circumstances which [gave] rise to copyright infringement”,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-d2bd0924-7985-48b2-84a1-f63c3d2fc3d6" data-toggle="modal" type="button">51</button></sup>

While I recognise that the employment relationship in the present case differs from the commercial relationship between a buyer and a seller in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng</span>, the Defendant could not exert any control over Mr Win’s actions by way of this relationship as these acts were carried out without the Defendant’s knowledge. In addition, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng</span>, there is no evidence to suggest that the Defendant had encouraged or incited Mr Win in any way to commit the infringing acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In relation to the second authorisation liability factor, the Defendant and Mr Win were engaged in a contractual relationship of employment. This relationship is evidently commercial in nature, at least in so far as there is an exchange of Mr Win’s services for a monthly wage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On the third authorisation liability factor, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant had failed to take reasonable steps in preventing the infringing acts. In particular, the Plaintiff points to the Defendant’s weak anti-software piracy policy, its poor communication of this policy to Mr Win, its recklessness in managing the Lenovo Laptop, and the free access which it grants Mr Win to its premises.

Moreover, Mr Win was not given adequate supervision in the course of his work. In particular, Mr Win’s supervisor only entered the toolroom when specific issues pertaining to the CNC machine arose, and Mr Wong only visited once in several months.

</div> Finally, I also note that the Defendant’s anti-software piracy policy was last brought to Mr Win’s attention in 2015 – more than five years before the infringing acts took place. There is no indication that there were subsequent reminders to Mr Win regarding the policy save for a lone inconspicuous A4-sized poster comprising three sentences, which was placed in the toolroom alongside an assortment of numerous other notices.

</div> or that the Lenovo Laptop had been taken and used by Mr Win. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Assessing these four factors in their entirety, I conclude that the Defendant did not authorise Mr Win’s infringing acts under s 31(1) of the Copyright Act. While the Defendant may have been negligent in the implementation of its anti-software piracy policy and in the conduct of its operations, I am satisfied that the Defendant did not sanction, approve, or countenance Mr Win’s infringing acts because it did not possess the knowledge that the infringing acts had occurred and had little practical control over Mr Win’s actions on the Lenovo Laptop. Moreover, the very existence of its anti-software piracy policy and the measures taken in furtherance of this policy support the conclusion that the Defendant would not have granted Mr Win, either expressly or impliedly, the right to commit the infringing acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For these reasons, the Defendant is not primarily liable for copyright infringement with respect to Mr Win’s actions.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Defendant is vicariously liable for copyright infringement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I begin my analysis by addressing an anterior issue which parties have taken to be a given – whether the doctrine of vicarious liability in tort extends to cases involving copyright infringement. Despite the dearth of local case law on this point, I take the view that it does. The doctrine of vicarious liability is a form of secondary liability which holds a defendant liable for the wrongful acts of another even if the defendant has not been negligent at all: <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Seng v Munib Mohammad Madni </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1074 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Seng</span>”) at [41]. In doing so, this doctrine seeks to ensure that the persons who put risky enterprises into the community are fairly held responsible when those risks emerge and cause loss or injury to members of the public: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and anor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 540 (“<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>”) at [70] citing <span class="font-italic">Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of St George’s v John Doe (a pseudonym) and John Doe (a pseudonym) </span>[2004] 1 SCR 436 at [20]. I see no reason why this doctrine cannot be extended to cases involving copyright infringement. The CA in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [86] clarified that it was not necessary to put any particular type of tortious misconduct into a special category where the doctrine of vicarious liability should not apply. Given that copyright infringement constitutes a statutory tort (see <span class="font-italic">Rank Film Distributors Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Video Information Centre (a firm) </span>[1982] 1 AC 380 at 420–421), it follows that it should not be excluded from the applicability of the doctrine of vicarious liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This conclusion is consistent with the position taken in other leading common law jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom, the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Hasani v Nettler and anor</span> [2019] EWHC 640 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Hasani</span>”) recognised the possibility of bringing a claim against a person for vicarious liability pertaining to copyright infringement. In that case, the claimant wrote a research paper while he was studying in London. The claimant was later admitted to a university for further studies. During this time, he handed his research paper to his academic supervisor. A few years later, the claimant alleged that his supervisor had published, in his own name, the research paper as an article in a book without permission or authorisation from the claimant. He brought copyright infringement claims against both the supervisor as well as the university. They, in turn, applied to strike out these claims. In striking out the claim of vicarious liability against the university, the English High Court held that the particulars of the claim failed to include facts which established a sufficiently close connection between the alleged infringement and the supervisor’s employment with the university: <span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Hasani</span> at [93.7] and [114]. In doing so, the court recognised that vicarious liability would have potentially been imposed on the university if these facts were present, thereby affirming the extension of the doctrine of vicarious liability to copyright infringement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34   A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in <span class="font-italic">Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Miles and </span><span class="font-italic">ors </span>[1961] 3 FLR 146. This case concerned the unauthorised performance of music at a club by a dance orchestra. The orchestra was engaged by members of the club to provide music for a social function. The plaintiff, who was the owner of the copyright subsisting in the music, brought a claim of copyright infringement against the members of the club. Although the Supreme Court found that the members were directly liable as the orchestra was found to have acted as servants of the club, it suggested that the members would have also been found vicariously liable as the employer of the orchestra. While this case is of some vintage, it has been cited by the High Court of Australia as support for the applicability of vicarious liability to copyright infringement under Australian law: <span class="font-italic">Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd </span>[2012] HCA 16 at [100]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Therefore, in the absence of express restrictions in the Copyright Act, I am satisfied that the doctrine of vicarious liability, as it has developed in our local jurisprudence, may be extended to copyright infringement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Both parties are in agreement that the legal test to be applied in determining whether vicarious liability should be imposed is the two-step inquiry formulated in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Seng </span>at [66]–[67]: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There must be a special relationship between the tortfeasor and the defendant (“the First Inquiry”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There must be a sufficient connection between the defendant and the tortfeasor on the one hand, and the commission of the tort on the other (“the Second Inquiry”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Applying this two-step test and taking the relevant policy considerations into account, I find that vicarious liability should be imposed on the Defendant. As parties are in agreement that the First Inquiry is made out by virtue of the contractual employment relationship between the Defendant and Mr Win, I turn to address the Second Inquiry directly. The CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Seng</span> at [44] explained that in assessing whether a sufficient connection exists, the central question to be asked is whether the defendant has in some way created or significantly enhanced, by virtue of the relationship, the very risk that in fact materialised. It also highlighted that this exercise is consistent with the “close connection” test set out in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>. To my mind, this suggests that the factors identified in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [87] as relevant in determining if a close connection exists between the creation or enhancement of a risk and the misconduct remain instructive to an assessment of the Second Inquiry. These factors include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The opportunity that the enterprise afforded the employee to abuse his or her power; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The extent to which the wrongful act may have furthered the employer’s aims (and hence be more likely to have been committed by the employee); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The vulnerability of potential victims to wrongful exercise of the employee’s power. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Having considered these factors, the court should take the relevant policy considerations into account in determining if an imposition of vicarious liability is justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On the facts, I am satisfied that there exists a sufficient connection between the employment relationship between Mr Win and the Defendant and the infringing acts which occurred. To begin with, I am persuaded that the circumstances in which Mr Win was allowed to operate in the course of his work afforded him the opportunity to commit the infringing acts. This follows from my earlier finding at [28] that the Defendant had failed to take reasonable steps in preventing Mr Win’s infringing acts. I accept the Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendant’s lax supervision of Mr Win afforded him the latitude and opportunity to commit the infringing acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Moreover, the Defendant’s mismanagement of the Lenovo Laptop facilitated the acts of copyright infringement. I am unable to adopt the Defendant’s explanation that the Defendant was not aware of the existence of the Lenovo Laptop and the fact that administrative controls had not been installed on it.

</div> This mismanagement of the Lenovo Laptop by the Defendant’s senior toolroom manager both created and enhanced the risk that Mr Win could commit the infringing acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Second, the infringing acts were committed in the context of Mr Win’s employment for the Defendant’s benefit. Even taking into account my previous finding at [22] that Mr Win’s infringing acts fell outside his job scope, as well as the Defendant’s evidence that the infringing NX Software was never used in relation to the Defendant’s official projects or jobs, I am unable to make the finding that Mr Win had carried out these acts for his own purposes. Mr Win did not install the infringing software in furtherance of his personal interests; he testified that he wanted to become more skilful in using the NX Software by obtaining more practice.

</div> This evinces the ultimate objective behind Mr Win’s acts of infringement – to improve his performance <span class="font-italic">at work</span>, which would necessarily be in relation to the tasks assigned to him by the Defendant. I also agree that the Defendant stood to benefit from the infringing acts, as an improvement in Mr Win’s skills would logically translate into an increase in productivity for the Defendant. To this end, the fact that the Defendant already possessed licences to use the relevant modules of the NX Software is irrelevant because the existing licences only allowed a single user to use the modules at any one time.

</div> Mr Win’s infringing use thus allowed him to practise on the module while<span class="font-italic"> </span>the authorised version of the software was concurrently processing the Defendant’s official projects. I make clear that this finding that Mr Win’s infringing acts were carried out in the <span class="font-italic">context</span> of his employment does not mean that they were committed within the <span class="font-italic">authorised scope</span> of his employment. This is therefore in line with my conclusion at [22] that Mr Win had acted outside the scope of the authority granted to him by the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For these reasons, I find that there is a sufficient connection between the relationship of employment and Mr Win’s infringing acts. The manner in which the Defendant handled its staff, operations, and assets created and enhanced the risk that Mr Win could commit the infringing acts. The acts were also committed in the context of Mr Win’s employment and were beneficial to the Defendant in furthering its commercial aims. The imposition of vicarious liability on the Defendant is therefore justifiable in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This conclusion is supported by a consideration of the two policy considerations highlighted by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span> at [76] – ensuring the effective compensation of the victim and the deterrence of future harm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The imposition of vicarious liability on the Defendant will ensure the effective compensation of the Plaintiff for the very reason that the Defendant is the person best placed and most able to provide such compensation.

</div> Even taking his promotion in 2019 into account, Mr Win is unlikely to possess sufficient financial resources to compensate the Plaintiff himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I also concur with the Plaintiff’s arguments that a finding of vicarious liability in this case will incentivise employers to take further steps in reducing the incidence of copyright infringement by their employees. Employers are generally placed in the best position to manage the conduct of their employees: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [80]. This is especially so for cases such as the present, which involve copyright infringement through the unauthorised downloading and installation of software. In these cases, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for the copyright owners to detect instances of infringement and to trace these instances to the wrongdoers. Indeed, if not for the automatic reporting function built into the Plaintiff’s software, Mr Win’s infringing acts would have gone unnoticed and unpunished. The particular vulnerability of copyright owners in these situations highlights the need to deter wrongdoers from such acts of infringement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The relevance of the two policy considerations above to the present case reinforces my finding that an imposition of vicarious liability on the present facts is not only justifiable, but also just and reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As a final point, I address the Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff had failed to take reasonable measures in this case because it (a) took four months to bring the misuse to the Defendant’s attention, (b) did not choose to pursue infringements committed by other actors, and (c) did not employ any preventive measures in safeguarding its interests.

</div> While the Defendant contends that these points militate against any finding of vicarious liability, I am not convinced.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, I see no merit in the Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff was potentially at fault for the ensuing liability because it delayed bringing the instances of infringement to the Defendant’s attention for a period of four months. I accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that even after its automatic reporting function informs it of potential infringements, it still needs to undertake an investigative process and conduct its due diligence. Given the “hundreds of infringements” coming into the Plaintiff’s system every day, the period of four months which the Plaintiff took to bring the infringement to the Defendant’s attention cannot be said to be unreasonable.

</div> From a broader policy perspective, imposing a duty on the part of the copyright owner to take active measures in protecting his or her copyright would be overly onerous. It would prejudice copyright owners endowed with less financial resources and unduly complicate the commercial calculus which these owners necessarily undertake in deciding the measures they need to put in place to monitor and/or prevent infringements of their copyright. As such, I decided that there was no need for expert evidence to assist me on further<span class="font-italic"> </span>measures which the Plaintiff could or should have taken to protect its copyright.

The object of damages is to compensate the plaintiff for loss or injury by placing him in the same position as he would have been in if the wrong had not been suffered. The plaintiff has the burden of proving its loss and damages should be liberally, albeit not punitively, assessed: <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng </span>at [47]. The parties agree that there are three approaches which may be adopted in the assessment of damages for infringements of copyright (see <span class="font-italic">General Tire and Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd </span>[1975] 1 WLR 819 (“<span class="font-italic">General Tire</span>”) at 824–826):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where the plaintiff is in the business of selling products which incorporate the protected material, the appropriate measure of damages is the loss of profit suffered by the plaintiff (“the Loss of Profit Approach”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the plaintiff exploits the copyright through the granting of licences for royalty payments, the appropriate measure of damages is the sum which the infringer would have paid by royalty if the infringer had acted legally instead of illegally (“the Established Licence Royalty Approach”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where it is not possible to prove a normal rate of profit or an established licence royalty, the appropriate measure of damages is the price which, although no price was actually quoted, the plaintiff could have reasonably charged for the infringer to have used the copyright in a hypothetical bargain (“the Hypothetical Bargain Approach”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Having considered the circumstances of this case, I find that the Hypothetical Bargain Approach should be adopted. The Loss of Profit Approach does not apply because the Plaintiff has adduced no evidence with respect to the profit it gains from the sale of each module by its distributor or reseller to an end-user. In fact, Mr Low expressly declined to comment on the profit margin accruing to the Plaintiff in relation to the net sales proceeds received by its distributors or resellers.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This leaves the Hypothetical Bargain Approach. This approach is founded upon the “user principle”, which is the principle that a person who has made wrongful use of another person’s property may be held liable to pay a reasonable sum of damages for this use: <span class="font-italic">Stoke-on-Trent City Council v W &amp; J Wass Ltd </span>[1988] 1 WLR 1406 at 1416. The utility of this principle is particularly evident in cases involving intellectual property, as such property may very well be “used” by an infringer without in any way affecting the condition or value of the property in its owner’s hands: David Llewelyn, “Assessment of Damages in Intellectual Property Cases – Some Recent Examples of "the Exercise of a Sound Imagination and the Practice of a Broad Axe"?” (2015) 27 SAcLJ 480 at para 25. The House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">General Tire </span>emphasised at 826 that this process is one of “judicial estimation of the available indications”, and that the true principle is for the court to consider what could have reasonably been charged for permission to use the right in question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Applying this approach, I find the Plaintiff’s measure of damages at $259,511 to be excessive. The primary basis for the assessment of damages according to this approach is to consider what sum would have been arrived at in hypothetical negotiations between the parties, having regard to the circumstances of the infringement(s), the parties’ respective bargaining positions, and the commercial context at the time of the breach: <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span><span class="font-italic"> v All Around the World Recordings Ltd</span> [2014] EWHC 3087 (IPEC) at [18]–[19]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As a preliminary step, the extent of Mr Win’s use of the infringing NX Software must be determined. This is because the Hypothetical Bargain Approach ultimately serves as a convenient means of valuing the benefit gained by the infringer (and correspondingly the loss suffered by the claimant): <span class="font-italic">Reformation Publishing Company Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Cruiseco Ltd and anor </span>[2018] EWHC 2761 (Ch) at [53]–[54]. An assessment of this benefit cannot be divorced from Mr Win’s use of the infringing software. Specifically, the benefit gained in the present case is the additional practice afforded to Mr Win with respect to specific modules in the infringing software. It is therefore altogether sensible for any hypothetical bargain to be assessed vis-à-vis the individual modules which were actually used by Mr Win. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This is implicitly recognised by the Plaintiff, who has limited the compensation it seeks to notional licence fees only for the modules allegedly used by Mr Win.

</div> I am of the opinion that the software supplemental terms by themselves are insufficient in refuting the Plaintiff’s account that annual licences were only introduced in 2021. These terms not only applied to a broad range of the Plaintiff’s products beyond the NX Software, but also merely contemplated the possibility that such time-limited licences could be offered by the Plaintiff. As such, had the parties entered into a hypothetical bargain at the date of the breach, only perpetual licences would have been available. I also agree with the Defendant that the appropriate measure of damages should relate to node-locked licences without the need for maintenance, as this coheres better with the fact that the infringing acts only occurred on a single device and involved only one version of the NX Software.

This provision states that a piece of evidence which falls within an exception to the hearsay rule may still be deemed not relevant if the court is of the view that it would not be in the interests of justice to treat it as relevant. Some factors which the court may take into consideration in determining if evidence should be excluded include the lack of reliability (where the circumstances of the author of a statement or in which the statement was made raise concerns about its truthfulness) and the evidence’s tendency to confuse or the evidence’s misleading effect (as when there are doubts about authenticity and good faith): <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [106] citing Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013) at para 6.052.

It is not disputed that upon being informed of the infringement, the Defendant immediately conducted its own internal investigations and stopped all infringing use.

</div> The documents adduced by the Defendant also show that, despite some lapses in implementation, it <span class="font-italic">did</span> have an anti-piracy policy in place. Any benefit accruing to the Defendant as a result of the infringing acts is also unlikely to be substantial given that Mr Win did not use the infringing NX Software for a significant period of time or on any official projects or jobs. Lastly, I did not find the Defendant’s conduct in the course of the proceedings to be so unsatisfactory as to warrant the imposition of additional damages. The Defendant was entirely justified in rejecting the Plaintiff’s offer to “legalize” the infringement by purchasing a module costing around $80,000 which it did not even require for its business.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Vicarious liability is “a form of strict liability” and “not based on any fault on the ultimate defendant”. According to the Defendant, this renders the imposition of additional damages unfair as the defendant will <span class="font-italic">already</span> be held liable without having committed any infringing acts itself. In the light of my conclusion in the previous paragraph, it is not necessary for me to make a determinative finding on this issue for the purposes of the present case. This is particularly so given that the Plaintiff has not had the opportunity to respond on this point. As such, I will leave the availability of additional damages as a remedy in cases involving vicarious liability for the courts’ future determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Moving to the other reliefs sought by the Plaintiff, I do not find it necessary to grant the declaratory relief which the Plaintiff asks for. The power to make a declaration is a discretionary power: <span class="font-italic">Wing </span><span class="font-italic">Joo Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and anor </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [176]. I agree with the Defendant that there is no longer any need for a declaration following my decision in this matter, which I deem sufficient in affirming the rights of the Plaintiff in respect of the present dispute with the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As a final point, I am satisfied that a permanent injunction should be granted in favour of the Plaintiff to restrain future infringements by the Defendant. It is generally accepted that a claimant will be entitled to a permanent injunction if he succeeds at the trial in establishing copyright infringement: <span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James</span> at para 21-234. While the Defendant has managed to put a stop to Mr Win’s infringing acts, the analysis above has also demonstrated that the management of staff and IT assets at the Defendant may not prove entirely effective in preventing acts of copyright infringement. Amid this backdrop, I find it just to grant a permanent injunction to restrain the Defendant from further infringements of the Plaintiff’s copyright.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In sum, I find the Defendant vicariously liable for the acts of copyright infringement committed by its employee, Mr Win, and assess damages at $30,574 to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. I also grant a permanent injunction restraining the Defendant from further infringements of the Plaintiff’s copyright subsisting in the NX Software. I make no order imposing additional damages on the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I will hear parties on interest and costs separately. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Dedar Singh Gill<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sivagnanaratnam Sivananthan, Mok Ho Fai and Loy Ming Chuen, Brendan (Bird &amp; Bird ATMD LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jevon Louis, Tan Jing Han, Alvin and Chong Kar Yee Cristel (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
