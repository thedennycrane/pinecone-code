As such, the requirements that must be satisfied for the court to grant such permission guide the issues to be determined in OA 122. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 These requirements were set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 883 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) at [44] (referencing <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Pheng Lip Ian v Chen Fun Gee and others </span>[2020] 1 SLR 586 at [24] and <span class="font-italic">Wong Souk Yee v Attorney-General </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1223 at [85]) (the “Requirements”): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the subject matter of the complaint has to be susceptible to judicial review; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the applicant has to have a sufficient interest in the matter; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the materials before the court have to disclose an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the applicant. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the present case, the first two Requirements were not in dispute. Based on the Applicant’s Statement, the key issue which arose in relation to Prayers (a) and (b) pertained to the third Requirement – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the materials before me disclosed an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to bring the Charges against the Applicant was: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a breach of Arts 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) unlawful and/or irrational as it was not based on any conclusive proof. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In relation to (a), although the Applicant stated that there was a breach of both Arts 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution in the Applicant’s Statement, no written or oral submissions on the breach of Art 12(2) were presented by the Applicant. There was hence no submission for the AG to respond to in relation to a breach of Art 12(2) and no submissions were made by the AG. As the Applicant did not take up this issue, it was not necessary to consider whether there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of a breach of Art 12(2) of the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In considering this third Requirement, it is useful to bear in mind, that as the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>held at [36], the burden is on the “person who challenges an executive decision based on an alleged breach of one or more of the fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution or based on other grounds of review established in administrative law”. While the threshold of proof for an application for leave to commence judicial review is “a very low one of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion … this does not mean that the evidence and arguments placed before the court can be either skimpy or vague and bare assertions will not suffice”: <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [54], referencing [44] therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Prayer (c) was an application for a <span class="font-italic">declaration</span> that the bringing of the Charges against the Applicant amounted to a breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution. Order 24 rule 5(1) of the ROC 2021 provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span>—(1) An application for a Mandatory Order, Prohibiting Order or Quashing Order —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) may include an application for a declaration which is ancillary to or consequential upon the Order; but </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) must not be made, unless permission to make the application for the Order has been granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, the success of Prayer (c) was consequential upon the success of Prayers (a) and/or (b). This was emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Xu Yuan Chen v Attorney-General </span>[2022] 2 SLR 1131 (“<span class="font-italic">Xu Yuan Chen</span>”), where the court held at [21] that the appellant there “[could not] be <span class="font-italic">granted</span> the [d]eclaration under O 53 of the ROC 2021 unless he first succeeds in obtaining leave to apply for the [p]rohibiting [o]rders”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In summary, the issues to be determined were: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the materials before me disclosed an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to bring the Charges against the Applicant was: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) a breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution; </div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) unlawful and/or irrational as the Charges were not based on any conclusive evidence; and </div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if so, whether there was a breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether there was a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie </span><span class="font-weight-bold">case that Art 12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">(1) had been breached</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As a preliminary matter, the AG highlighted that pursuant to O 24 r 5(4) of the ROC 2021, the Applicant is bound by the grounds and relief set out in his statement and may not rely on any ground not set out in the statement unless the Court otherwise allows.

</div> I will hence proceed to consider them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Article 12(1) of the Constitution states that, “[a]ll persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Court of Appeal has provided extensive guidance on the consideration of applications for leave to commence judicial review for breach of Art 12(1). In <span class="font-italic">Xu Yuan Chen</span>, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the High Court’s dismissal of the appellant’s application for leave to commence judicial review on the basis that the appellant had not shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> breach of Art 12(1). In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held at [1], citing <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy a/l Kataiah </span>[2022] SGCA 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span>”) at [29], that “the concept of equality under Art 12(1) does not mean that all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons <span class="font-italic">in like situations </span>will be treated alike” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Additionally, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> reiterated at [29] the two-step test that has been developed in our local jurisprudence to determine whether executive action breaches Art 12(1) (referencing <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Attorney-General </span>[2021] 1 SLR 809 at [61]–[62]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the applicant must first discharge his evidential burden of showing that he has been treated differently from other equally situated persons; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the evidential burden then shifts to the decision-maker in question to show that the differential treatment was reasonable, in that it was based on legitimate reasons which made the differential treatment proper. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In ascertaining whether persons are “equally situated”, the Court of Appeal further held at [30] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court [will] have regard to the nature of the executive action in question (see <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (CA) </span>at [63] and <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [327]) and consider whether, in that context, the persons being compared are so situated that it is reasonable to consider that they should be similarly treated. … the test is a factual one of whether a prudent person would objectively think the persons concerned are roughly equivalent or similarly situated in all material respects … Here, the notion of being equally situated is ‘an analytical tool used to isolate the purported rationale for differential treatment, so that its legitimacy may then be assessed properly’… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Further guidance on the application of this test, in the context of applications for leave to commence judicial review on the ground of breach of Art 12(1) in criminal proceedings, is found in the Court of Appeal decisions in <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span> and <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>two people were convicted of the same charges for trafficking in drugs; however, only one was granted a certificate of substantive assistance. The appellant sought leave to commence judicial review proceedings against the Prosecution’s decision not to grant him the same certificate, claiming that his Art 12 rights had consequently been breached. The Court of Appeal held at [51] that the applicant could satisfy his evidential burden by showing: (a) that his level of involvement in the offence and the consequent knowledge he had acquired of the drug syndicate he was dealing with was “practically identical to” that of the co-offender, and (b) that he and his co-offender had provided “practically the same information” to the Central Narcotics Bureau – yet only the co-offender was given the certificate. This would constitute a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion of breach. Only then would the evidential burden shift to the Prosecution to justify its decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span>, the appellant filed an application for leave to commence judicial review to obtain a prohibiting order against the Singapore Prison Service to stay his execution. He alleged that he had been scheduled for execution ahead of other prisoners who had been sentenced to death before him and that this breached Art 12. The Court of Appeal considered that prisoners may <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>be regarded as being equally situated once they have been denied clemency (at [64]). The Court also accepted as a rational baseline the State’s position as to what equal treatment entailed – namely, that all else being equal, prisoners whose executions arose for scheduling should be executed in the order in which they were sentenced to death (at [72]). Another prisoner, Datchinamurthy, had been scheduled for execution later than the appellant, despite having been sentenced to death before the appellant (at [75]). It appeared that no differentiating factors were available to justify the differential treatment of the appellant and Datchinamurthy (at [76]). The Court found that the appellant had made out a <span class="font-italic">prima fac</span><span class="font-italic">ie </span>case of reasonable suspicion, and granted leave to commence judicial review proceedings (at [77]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Applicant submitted that the Prosecution’s bringing of the Charges against him constituted a breach of Art 12(1) as other parties that were involved in the Corruption Scheme upon which the Charges were founded were not investigated (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, selective investigation). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Applicant claimed that there were no payments from his bank accounts or from Neptune to Harish.

</div> As such, payments to Harish could only have been made by Staghorn Singapore. Harish’s interest in Staghorn Singapore was concealed to induce MOPS to make payments to Staghorn Singapore. This formed the basis of the Additional Charges against Harish and Gopinath. Yet, Parthiban, who was named in the Additional Charges (see [10] above), had not been investigated by the Prosecution.

</div> In investigating and deciding whether to prosecute Harish’s Three Other Associates, the Prosecution considered the difficulties in investigation, prosecution, and enforcement against them. As for Parthiban, the AG submitted that the Prosecution would be taking into account the evidence of Parthiban’s level of involvement and knowledge in the corruption dealings and other relevant factors and would assess what action to take after the criminal proceedings against the Applicant, Harish, and Gopinath are concluded.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This axiom did not accurately reflect nor engage the holdings in the Four CA Decisions. Even if I assumed that the axiom was correct, it also did not assist the Applicant. The Prosecution’s position was that the Applicant was the sole bribe-giver, and the other parties in the scheme were intermediaries or recipients of the bribe. The PCA charges against the Applicant were consequently in relation to s 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCA for giving gratification. On the other hand, the PCA charges against Harish and Gopinath are in relation to s 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCA for receiving gratification. The Applicant did not present any materials which showed a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case, beyond a bare assertion, that he was not the sole bribe-giver, and that there are others who should be similarly charged because they are equally situated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In any event, and more fundamentally, as stated above, the axiom characterised by counsel for the Applicant did not accurately reflect the law and guidance set out by the Court of Appeal in the Four CA Decisions. Nor did it explain why a different position from what the Court of Appeal has consistently held, should be taken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As was held in <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30], the “test is a factual one of whether a prudent person would objectively think the persons concerned are roughly equivalent or similarly situated in all material respects”. In the present case, the Prosecution’s position was that the Applicant was the sole bribe-giver in the alleged Corruption Scheme and there was no other person who had agreed to pay and/or paid the kickbacks. The Prosecution had also brought charges against Harish and Gopinath; however, this was for their roles in, amongst other things, conspiring to accept the bribes from the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>, the Court of Appeal at [51] went beyond the similarity of charges to examine whether one offender’s level of involvement in the offence and the consequent knowledge he acquired of the drug syndicate he was dealing with, was “practically identical” to a co-offender’s level of involvement. Here, the Applicant had not shown that there was someone else who was in a “like situation” as him, whose involvement was “practically identical” as him, in the vein of the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>, and was not charged despite also being a bribe-giver. Applying the test as set out in <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span>, I found that a prudent person would be of the view that there were no other persons in this case who were similarly situated to the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 At the hearing, the Applicant emphasised that the lack of investigation into and prosecution of Staghorn Singapore and/or Parthiban constituted a breach of Art 12(1). However, neither were in a like situation as the Applicant. They were intermediary parties between Neptune and Harish in the alleged scheme and not bribe-givers like the Applicant. Additionally, Neptune was the party that was awarded the contracts by MOPS at the inflated prices. The Applicant did not show how Parthiban or Staghorn Singapore was related to or involved with Neptune, in the way the Applicant was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Harish’s Three Other Associates were also not in a like situation as the Applicant. They were intermediaries with control of the companies to which the kickbacks were paid before reaching Harish. As such, they could not be said to have been in a “like situation” as the Applicant nor was their involvement “practically identical”. Relatedly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Xu Yuan Chen </span>at [39] has recognised the Prosecution’s consideration of the difficulty in investigation, prosecution, and enforcement as a potential differentiating factor between two accused persons’ situations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Applicant briefly mentioned that a contract manager at MOPS who awarded the contracts was not investigated.

</div> However, the Applicant did not provide any evidence of the contract manager’s role or explain how he was involved in the Scheme. In any event, on its face, being a staff of MOPS, the contract manager would have been involved, if at all, as a recipient of the bribe(s), not as a bribe-giver. He would hence also not be in a like situation as the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Applicant also mentioned that one Sudeep Shome (“Shome”), who was one of the signatories from Neptune, had not been investigated.

In other words, there was no evidence adduced of Shome’s involvement in the Corruption Scheme.

The court held that the appellant had not discharged his burden of establishing a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of breach of Art 12(1), and observed that in any event, the appellant was ‘the main culprit’ behind the criminal enterprise and his co-conspirator’s willingness to testify was ‘a relevant consideration which could have operated on the mind of the Public Prosecutor in preferring separate charges’ against them (<span class="font-italic">Quek Hock Lye </span>at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In this case, while various parties were involved in the same criminal enterprise, the Applicant was the sole bribe-giver in the alleged scheme.

</div> The Prosecution had explained that all decisions were taken based on the evidence and considerations of public interest. There was nothing improper in the Prosecution proceeding with the Charges against the Applicant even though the Prosecution was unable to and/or had at this stage decided not to also proceed with charges against other persons involved in or related to the Corruption Scheme, such as, Harish’s Three Other Associates and/or Parthiban. This did not constitute any abuse of power. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Additionally, although the DPP’s affidavit stated that Harish’s Three Other Associates had been “uncooperative with the CPIB”, that did not mean that the Prosecution would clearly be unable to discharge its burden of proof at trial. It was open for the Prosecution to rely on other evidence to prove the Charges.

Importantly, the forum where the discharge of the Prosecution’s burden of proof is to take place, is at the criminal trial. If the Applicant wishes to challenge the evidence against him, he will have the right and opportunity to do so in the criminal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Additionally, as held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>at [74], the AG is not under any general obligation to disclose his reasons for making a particular prosecutorial decision. More fundamentally, the court should presume that the AG’s prosecutorial decisions are constitutional or lawful until they are shown to be otherwise: <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span> at [44]. The Applicant had not shown otherwise here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For completeness, the Applicant had not identified an improper purpose that the Prosecution was acting on by bringing the Charges. Additionally, even if the Applicant was a whistle-blower, that fact may go towards sentencing, but it did not preclude the Prosecution from proceeding with the Charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the bringing of the Charges constituted a breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Applicant submitted that, as the bringing of the Charges constituted a breach of his rights under Art 12(1) and were irrational and/or unlawful, the AG breached Art 35(8) of the Constitution and thus the applicant sought a declaration of such.

As Art 12(1) had not been breached, and the sufficiency of evidence underpinning a prosecutorial decision was not a matter for judicial review in the absence of any abuse of power or breach of constitutional rights, it was clear that the Applicant also had no case on the basis of Art 35(8). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Indeed, the Applicant’s case that Art 35(8) was breached was predicated on a breach of Art 12(1) and/or the Charges being brought against him despite lack of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Given my findings above in relation to Issues 1 and 2, I found that there was no basis to the Applicant’s case that there was a breach of Art 35(8). Moreover, in the same vein as held in <span class="font-italic">Xu Yuan Chen</span> at [21], since permission had not been granted here for the Applicant to apply for the prohibiting and quashing orders, the Applicant’s prayer for the declaration also fell away, <span class="font-italic">per </span>O 24 r 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For the reasons above, I dismissed OA 122. The daily tariff for judicial review applications under Appendix G are in the range of $14,000–$35,000. The AG asked for costs at $6,000 all-in, inclusive of disbursements of more than $800, while the Applicant submitted for $5,000 all-in. Taking into account that the work done includes the filing of an affidavit, and both written <span class="font-italic">and</span> oral submissions, costs were awarded to the AG in the sum of $5,500 all-in.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tean (Carson Law Chambers) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gan Yingtian Andrea and Zhicong Lee (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
