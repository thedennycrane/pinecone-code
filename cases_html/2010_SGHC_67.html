<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, HSBC Institutional Trust Services
                    (Singapore) Limited (“HSBCIT”), sues in its capacity as trustee of
                    Mapletree Logistics Trust. HSBCIT is the owner and was the landlord of the
                    property known as 9 Tampines Street 92 Singapore 528871 (“the
                    Property”). The first defendant, Elchemi Assets Pte Ltd
                    (“Elchemi”), is engaged in the business of technology asset
                    management. The second defendant, Ang Chee Seng (“Ang”), was at
                    all material times a director of Elchemi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By a lease agreement in writing dated
                    12 January 2009, HSBCIT leased the Property to Elchemi for a term of 15
                    years commencing from 1 November 2008 and expiring on 31 October
                    2023.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By a Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity dated
                    8 July 2009, Ang agreed to guarantee payment of all sums that were due and
                    payable by Elchemi to HSBCIT under the lease agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Unfortunately, Elchemi failed to make payment of
                    sums due under the lease agreement. As at 21 August 2009, a sum of
                    $4,869,529.17 was due as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Elchemi continued to be in default
                    notwithstanding letters of demand for payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 27 August 2009, HSBCIT’s
                    solicitors wrote to Elchemi to demand that vacant possession of the Property be
                    delivered by 11am of 28 August 2009. They also stated that the lease
                    agreement would be terminated upon such re-entry. On 28 August 2009,
                    Elchemi’s solicitors wrote to HSBCIT’s solicitors to confirm that
                    vacant possession of the Property would be delivered to HSBCIT. Accordingly, the
                    lease agreement was terminated on 28 August 2009 upon re-entry by
                    HSBCIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Subsequently, HSBCIT commenced the present
                    action against Elchemi and Ang for outstanding rental and other arrears and for
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After a defence and counterclaim was filed by
                    the defendants, HSBCIT filed Summons No 5625 of 2009 on 28 October
                    2009 to seek final judgment for $2,434,336.41 against Elchemi and Ang and
                    interlocutory judgment against both defendants for damages to be assessed
                    pursuant to certain provisions in the lease agreement together with interest and
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       HSBCIT also filed Summons No 5626 of 2009
                    on 28 October 2009 to strike out the counterclaim of the defendants on the
                    following grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it disclosed no reasonable cause of
                            action;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it was scandalous, frivolous and
                            vexatious;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it might prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair
                            trial of the action; and/or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it was otherwise an abuse of the process of the
                            court.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 15 December 2009, an assistant
                    registrar granted HSBCIT summary judgment as sought and dismissed the
                    counterclaim of the defendants with costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 19 January 2010, Elchemi and Ang filed
                    an appeal against the decision to grant summary judgment. Apparently, they also
                    wanted to file an appeal against the decision to dismiss the counterclaim but
                    were late in doing so. Instead of asking for an extension of time to do so, they
                    decided not to pursue an appeal against the decision to strike out the
                    counterclaim, leaving only their appeal against summary judgment to be dealt
                    with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 11 February 2010, I heard their appeal
                    and dismissed it. They have intimated that they will be appealing against my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the outset, I should mention that the
                    appeal filed on 19 January 2010 against the summary judgment granted by the
                    assistant registrar on 15 December 2009 might itself have been out of time,
                    but this point was not taken by HSBCIT’s counsel and no argument was made
                    thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The sole defence relied on by the defendants
                    in their pleadings was that the gross floor area of the Property was 9,175.75
                    square metres and not 11,089.22 square metres, as stated in a letter of offer
                    from HSBCIT, and on which the rent was calculated. This discrepancy was
                    discovered by a survey which Elchemi had obtained. The defendants claimed that
                    this was a fundamental breach and a misrepresentation which excused Elchemi from
                    paying whatever was stipulated in the lease agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The short answer to this allegation was that
                    this point had been raised by Elchemi with HSBCIT in September 2008 even before
                    the lease agreement was signed on 12 January 2009. It was first raised in a
                    meeting on 12 September 2008 between representatives of Elchemi and
                    HSBCIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It was raised again in a letter of
                    25 September 2008 from Elchemi’s solicitors as one of the issues in
                    which Elchemi sought clarification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 9 October 2008, HSBCIT stated that the
                    gross floor area that it (HSBCIT) was relying on was confirmed by the latest
                    approved Grant of Written Permission issued by the Urban Redevelopment Authority
                    (“URA”) dated 29 November 2005. HSBCIT further said that
                    Elchemi might, if it wished, request its consultants to carry out further checks
                    with URA to ascertain the correct measurement prior to the commencement of the
                    term on 1 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     No further inquiry was raised thereafter by
                    Elchemi or on its behalf and the lease agreement was entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In addition, Elchemi had on various occasions
                    tendered cheques to make payment of its obligations under the lease agreement
                    based on the gross floor area which HSBCIT was relying on and not the other way
                    around. Those cheques were dishonoured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the circumstances, I was of the view that
                    this reference to the gross floor area again was a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In Ang’s affidavit to resist
                    HSBCIT’s application for summary judgment, he raised fresh allegations not
                    found in the defence. I was of the view that he was not entitled to do so unless
                    the defendants had first applied for and obtained leave to amend his defence
                    (see my decision in <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR (R) 786). The
                    defendants did not seek leave to do so and accordingly, were not entitled to
                    rely on the fresh allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Be that as it may, I will deal quickly with
                    the main fresh allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     One of the main fresh allegations was that
                    HSBCIT had orally assured Elchemi that it would not insist on strict compliance
                    with the lease agreement, which was only a formality, or that there were oral
                    variations thereof. I found this suggestion preposterous especially when Elchemi
                    had the benefit of legal representation before it entered into the lease
                    agreement. There was also a provision in the lease agreement, <em>ie</em>, cl 6.10 which provides that HSBCIT is not bound by any
                    representation or promise which is not contained in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The next main fresh allegation was that the
                    guarantee was not in fact executed on 8 July 2009 but on 14 July 2009.
                    More importantly, Ang was saying that he executed it on the basis that he was
                    assured that it would not be enforced against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It was immaterial to me whether the guarantee
                    was signed on 8 or 14 July 2009. If it was signed on 14 July 2009 but
                    wrongly dated 8 July 2009, that alone did not invalidate the guarantee.
                    There was no suggestion that Ang could rely on a lack of consideration for the
                    guarantee. As for the allegation that he was assured that it would not be relied
                    on, he would have made the allegation at the earliest opportunity if it were
                    true. Yet no such allegation was stated in the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Furthermore, as a businessman, he must know
                    that the reason for taking the trouble to obtain a guarantee from him, after the
                    lease agreement was signed, was precisely to rely on it if need be. I had no
                    hesitation in concluding that he was concocting his allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There are a few other points I would like to
                    mention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Since the lease agreement was terminated on
                    28 August 2008, the rent etc should be calculated up to that date and not
                    31 August 2008. Damages are claimable thereafter. This may entail some
                    minor adjustment in the overall liquidated amount claimed by
                HSBCIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The costs I ordered for the appeal ($3,000)
                    and for the hearing below (totalling $8,000) were on a standard basis as HSBCIT
                    did not specify the basis for indemnity costs in its pleadings. Unfortunately,
                    HSBCIT’s counsel omitted to inform me that the assistant registrar had
                    also granted on the same day, <em>ie</em>, 15 December
