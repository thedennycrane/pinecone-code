</div> Under the SPA, the first claimant agreed to acquire the second claimant – and through it, a completed and commissioned Project – at a price of $70m.

It is necessary to introduce these terms now to understand the parties’ dispute:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under cl 9.1.1, the parties recorded that the various payments under the SPA were based on the express assumption that the Project would be certified by the first claimant’s engineer as being fully operational, and therefore able to supply electricity for sale and to generate revenue, no later than 31 March 2013. This event is referred to as “wet commissioning”. The date on which it actually took place is referred to as the wet commissioning date (“WCD”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under cl 9.1.4, the respondent undertook to be solely liable for any Cost Overrun in the Project so that neither claimant would have to bear any overrun. “Cost Overrun” is defined in the SPA as “any and all Project Costs in excess of” a stated figure. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The respondent’s obligation to bear the Cost Overrun was reiterated in cl 10.2.4, in which the respondent undertook to “bear and contribute or indemnify and hold harmless” the claimants against any and all Cost Overrun as required by cl 9.1.4.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Under cl 6.4.1(b)(iv), the first claimant agreed to pay $5.1m of the purchase consideration directly to the second claimant, to be recorded in the second claimant’s books as a loan due from the second clamant to the respondent (as the seller under the SPA). The SPA defines this loan as the “seller’s subordinated loan” or “SSL”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Under cl 9.7, if the respondent failed to pay any Cost Overrun despite being obliged to do so, the second claimant was entitled to reduce the SSL in its books against the unpaid Cost Overrun.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Under cl 6.4.7, the respondent was obliged to furnish to the first claimant an unconditional irrevocable bank guarantee valid until 30 April 2013 in the amount of $6.9m (“Security Bond I”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Under cl 9.3, if the WCD was after 7 April 2013, the first claimant had the right to call on Security Bond I.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Under cl 9.11, the first claimant was entitled to monitor the development and construction of the Project until the WCD. This included the right to have access to the work site and a right to information and documents. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Under cl 9.10(a), if the WCD was after 31 March 2013, the first claimant was entitled to require the respondent to cede control of the construction and commissioning of the Project to the first claimant.

</div> The Y-piece failed twice under hydrostatic testing, in March and June 2013. It passed hydrostatic testing only in October 2013. But, during further hydrostatic testing in early November 2013, cracks developed in other sections of the penstock. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 From November 2013, the first claimant began to oversee the Project more closely. But it did so without formally exercising its right to take control of the Project under cl 9.10(a) of the SPA (see [10(h)] above). Finally, in March 2014, the first claimant did exercise that right and issued a takeover notice taking full control of the Project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The first claimant’s first order of business was to address the penstock failure.

The Supreme Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Damani</span> that the request by the appellant ostensibly under the Indian equivalent of Art 33 was not in truth a request for clarification but was “designed as if the appellant was seeking review of the award” and was therefore “wholly misconceived” (at [8]). On this basis, the Supreme Court held that it did not trigger a postponement (at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The claimants argue, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Damani</span>, that only a genuine request under Art 33 triggers the postponement of the time limit under Art 34(3) of the Model Law. Any other interpretation, they submit, would allow a party to abuse Art 34(3) by contriving a request under Art 33 to engineer a unilateral extension of time for its setting-aside application. That, the claimants submit, seriously undermines the finality of awards, a fundamental principle in both the Model Law and the IAA.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The respondent responds that <span class="font-italic">Damani</span> should not be followed in Singapore. The plain language of Art 34(3) of the Model Law contains no indication that the “request … made under Art 33” must satisfy a qualitative test in order to trigger a postponement of the commencement of the time limit under the second limb. The respondent also refers to several decisions in other jurisdictions which have taken a position contrary to <span class="font-italic">Damani</span>. In particular, the respondent points to the decision of New Zealand’s Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum Mining Co Ltd v Shell (Petroleum Mining) Co Ltd</span> [2015] 2 NZLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum</span>, the New Zealand Court of Appeal had to interpret provisions in the New Zealand arbitration legislation which are <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with Arts 33 and 34 of the Model Law. The question in <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum</span>, as in the present case, was whether the second limb of Art 34(3) requires a request under Art 33 (in that case, for an additional award) to satisfy a qualitative test. At first instance, the New Zealand High Court held that the second limb of Art 34(3) would not be triggered unless the requesting party had a “reasonable basis” for making the request under Art 33. The High Court considered that that approach was necessary to prevent abuse of Art 33 and a circumvention of the strict time limit in Art 34(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The New Zealand Court of Appeal reversed the High Court. It held that the language of Art 34(3) does not require a request under Art 33 to satisfy a qualitative test in order for it to trigger a postponement. Stevens J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said (at [37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no support in the statutory language of either arts 33(3) or 34(3) for a qualitative gloss on the nature of the request for an additional award. We reject [the respondent’s] submission to the contrary. Adding a qualitative requirement that a request under art 33(3) be a “proper” request would mean that a party would not know whether it has made a request in terms of that article until the arbitral tribunal either grants or rejects its application. Moreover, the notion of a requirement for a proper request is inconsistent with the language of art 34(3) which speaks only of a request being “disposed of”. It is not limited to cases where the request is “granted”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I accept this reasoning. I therefore reject the claimants’ argument that only a genuine request under Art 33 of the Model Law triggers a postponement under the second limb of Art 34(3). It is no doubt a legitimate concern that the lack of a qualitative test will give a party an undesirable and unintended incentive to contrive a request under Art 33 in order to secure more time to bring an application under Art 34(3), particularly given the three-month time limit is strict. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Even so, that concern must not be overstated. Article 33 of the Model Law itself provides fixed timelines within which any request must be made to the tribunal and within which the tribunal must respond to any request. The party must make its request under Art 33 within 30 days of receiving the award. Unless it exercises its power to extend time, the tribunal must dispose of a request for a correction within 30 days of receiving the request and must dispose of a request for an additional award within 60 days. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The temporal effect of any abuse of the request mechanism in Art 33 is constrained by these provisions. Further, the tribunal need not use all the time which Art 33 affords it. The more contrived a request is, the quicker the tribunal will dispose of it. That further constrains the potential for abuse. The final constraint on abuse is the tribunal’s power to award costs against a party who contrives a request under Art 33.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Requiring a qualitative test to be satisfied before the second limb of Art 34(3) is triggered would introduce great uncertainty post-award. As Stevens J noted in <span class="font-italic">Todd Petroleum</span> (see [43] above), neither party (nor indeed the tribunal or a court) can know whether a request will pass that qualitative test at the time the request is made. It is true, as the claimants suggest, that the qualitative test can be set at a very low threshold to require simply that the request that is <span class="font-italic">not</span> just a disguised plea for the tribunal to reconsider the merits of the award. But, however it is framed, and however low the threshold is set, a qualitative test will remain a subjective test. On the qualitative approach, nobody can ever know with certainty whether the three-month time limit under Art 34(3) has commenced, continues to run or has been halted until and unless that qualitative test is applied to the request. Consequently, nobody can ever know when an award becomes final until the qualitative determination is made. That uncertainty is equally inimical to the fundamental principle of finality of awards. When an award has become or will become final must be capable of ascertainment with certainty, and therefore by reference to objective factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The uncertainty engendered would also lead to potential wasted time and costs. The qualitative approach would encourage a party who makes a request under Art 33 to file a concurrent setting-aside application under Art 34 of the Model Law purely out of an abundance of caution. Filing both applications concurrently is procedurally inelegant in that it forces a party to apply to set aside an award even though the award may yet be corrected, clarified or supplemented to remove the grounds for setting aside. It is also at odds with the fundamental principle that parties to an arbitration should first seek redress from the tribunal before turning to the courts (see <span class="font-italic">BLB and </span><span class="font-italic">anor v BLC and ors</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1169 at [103]). It would also completely negate the very purpose of the second limb of Art 34(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, there is no evidence that the drafters of the Model Law intended that the second limb of Art 34(3) be triggered by a qualitative test. On the contrary, the discussion of Art 34(3) in the seventh session of the UNCITRAL Working Group on International Contract Practices (“Report of the Working Group on International Contract Practices on the Work of its Seventh Session”, UNCITRAL, 17th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/246 (“Report of the Working Group”) at para 138) shows that the drafters were alive to the risk of abuse without a qualitative test, but considered it a constrained risk and accepted that risk in the current drafting of Art 34(3):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As regards the words “or, if a request had been made under article 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal”, there was considerable support for deleting those words since they might open the door for dilatory tactics by a party and because an unbreakable time-limit for applications for setting aside was desirable for the sake of certainty and expediency. <span class="font-italic">The prevailing view, however, was to retain those words since they presented the reasonable consequence of article 33 which allowed a party to request a correction, interpretation or an additional award</span>. <span class="font-italic">It was also pointed out that</span> <span class="font-italic">the periods of time contained in article 33 enabled the arbitral tribunal to minimize the risk of dilatory tactics and provided a basis for calculating the possible extension of the time-limit prescribed in paragraph (3) of article 34</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Accordingly, I reject the claimants’ first proposition at [38(a)] above. The commencement of the three-month time limit under Art 34(3) is postponed whenever a party makes a request to the tribunal under Art 33. Whether a request is made under Art 33 is purely a matter of form and does not depend on evaluating the substance of the request by applying any qualitative test.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Must the request be material?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The claimants’ second argument on their preliminary point is that the second limb of Art 34(3) applies only where the request under Art 33 of the Model Law is “material” to the setting aside application which is ultimately made. The key authority cited for this proposition is the decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Company Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Songa Offshore Equinox Ltd and anor</span> [2018] EWHC 538 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Daewoo Shipbuilding</span>”).

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 <span class="font-italic">Daewoo Shipbuilding</span> is clearly distinguishable and does not assist the claimants. In that case, the court was interpreting provisions of the English Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) which set out the applicable time limits for bringing a challenge to an award or for filing an appeal on a question of law arising from an award. Section 70(3) of the English Arbitration Act provides that any challenge or appeal against an award must be brought within 28 days of the date of the award “or, if there has been any <span class="font-italic">arbitral process of appeal or review</span>, of the date when the applicant or appellant was notified of the result of that process” [emphasis added]. It was accepted that the words “any arbitral process of appeal or review” under s 70(3) do not <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> apply to an application to <span class="font-italic">correct</span> the award. However, an established line of English authorities has held that s 70(3), on its true construction, could apply to an application to correct an award where the corrections sought were <span class="font-italic">material</span> to the intended s 70 application (at [53], [60]–[61]). In the court’s view, “the test of materiality is inherent in the structure of section 70(2) and 70(3)”, and this explained why the postponement of the commencement of the time limit in s 70(3) applied only to cases where there was an application for “appeal or review”, and not to applications for corrections of an award (at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 <span class="font-italic">Daewoo Shipbuilding</span> is distinguishable because the legislative starting point in the English Arbitration Act is quite different from that in the Model Law. Under the English Arbitration Act, the commencement of the time limit for challenging an award is not generally postponed by an application to correct the award. Under the Model Law, on the other hand, the commencement of the time limit for challenging an award <span class="font-italic">is</span> postponed by <span class="font-italic">every</span> application to correct an award. Referring again to the Report of the Working Group (cited at [49] above), the drafters believed that postponing the commencement of the three-month time limit was “the reasonable consequence of article 33 which allowed a party to request a correction, interpretation or an additional award”. Thus, while the English cases require that any correction sought must be <span class="font-italic">material</span> before the commencement of the time limit will be postponed by way of exception to the general position, the clear wording of Art 34(3) of the Model Law postpones the commencement of the time limit for any and every type of request under Art 33. Indeed, under Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), a request could seek correction of any errors from the material (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “errors in computation”, which could be material to a setting aside application) to the purely editorial (“any clerical or typographical errors” which could never be material). <span class="font-italic">Daewoo Shipbuilding</span> was therefore based on an English legislative provision that is not only <span class="font-italic">not</span> based on the Model Law, but which adopts a diametrically different scheme for time limits for challenging an award from that adopted in the Model Law. The approach in <span class="font-italic">Daewoo Ship</span><span class="font-italic">building</span> is not of assistance in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Accordingly, I reject the claimants’ second proposition at [38(b)] above also. The commencement of the three-month time limit under Art 34(3) is postponed whenever a party makes a request to the tribunal under Art 33. Whether the request is material to the intended setting aside application is immaterial to the postponement of the time limit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the preliminary point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I therefore accept the respondent’s submission that the three-month time limit to bring its application commenced only on 23 March 2018, under the second limb of Art 34(3) of the Model Law, when the tribunal disposed of the respondent’s request for correction. The respondent’s setting-aside application has therefore been brought within time. The claimants’ preliminary point is rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I turn now to consider the law applicable to a setting-aside application under the IAA and to the respondent’s application on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on setting aside</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As grounds for setting aside the parts of the award which they challenge, both the claimants and the respondent rely principally on the ground that the tribunal acted in breach of natural justice. The respondent relies on the additional ground that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction. It is therefore useful to begin with a brief summary of the relevant legal principles on these two grounds which will be applicable to both cross-applications. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breach of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It is common ground that to challenge an arbitral award for breach of natural justice, the four requirements in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span>”) must be established, namely: (a) the of natural justice which was breached; (b) how it was breached; (c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced the party’s rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The rule of natural justice that both parties allege has been breached in this case is the fair hearing rule. Both parties allege that the tribunal failed to consider parts of their respective arguments and evidence in the arbitration, as a result of which they say the tribunal reached a different conclusion on certain issues than it could otherwise have reached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The fundamental duty of an adjudicator is to apply his mind to the arguments put before him. This has been well-recognised as an essential aspect of the rules of natural justice (see <span class="font-italic">AKN </span><span class="font-italic">and anor v ALC and anor and other appeals</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”) at [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To fail to consider an important issue that has been pleaded in an arbitration is a breach of natural justice because in such a case, the arbitrator would not have brought his mind to bear on an important aspect of the dispute before him. Consideration of the pleaded issues is an essential feature of the rule of natural justice that is encapsulated in the Latin adage, <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span> …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Establishing that a tribunal wholly failed to consider an issue, however, is a difficult endeavour. In most cases, the court is asked to infer that a tribunal failed to bring its mind to bear on a particular issue at all from the tribunal’s silence on that issue. But silence may be, and often is, equivocal. For that reason, the inference from the tribunal’s silence that it failed to bring its mind to bear on a particular issue placed before it must be “clear and virtually inescapable”. As the Court in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> went on to note (at [46]–[47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It will usually be a matter of inference rather than of explicit indication that the arbitrator wholly missed one or more important pleaded issues. However, the inference – that the arbitrator indeed failed to consider an important pleaded issue – if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to be clear and virtually inescapable. <span class="font-italic">If the facts are also consistent with the arbitrator simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case, or having been mistaken as to the law, or having chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary</span> (notwithstanding that this view may have been formed based on a misunderstanding of the aggrieved party’s case), <span class="font-italic">then the inference that the arbitrator did not apply his mind at all to the dispute before him (or to an important aspect of that dispute) and so acted in breach of natural justice should not be drawn.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [N]o party to an arbitration had a right to expect the tribunal to accept its arguments, regardless of how strong and credible it perceived those arguments to be … This principle is important because <span class="font-italic">it points to an important distinction between, on the one hand, an arbitral tribunal’s decision to reject an argument</span> <span class="font-italic">(whether implicitly or otherwise, whether rightly or wrongly, and whether or not as a result of its failure to comprehend the argument and so to appreciate its merits), and, on the other hand, the arbitral tribunal’s failure to even consider that argument</span>. Only the latter amounts to a breach of natural justice; the former is an error of law, not a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Another aspect of the right to a fair hearing is that a party must be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case. This ground comes within both s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law (see <span class="font-italic">ADG </span><span class="font-italic">and anor v ADI</span> <span class="font-italic">and another matter </span>[2014] 3 SLR 481 (“<span class="font-italic">ADG</span>”) at [118]). In <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro</span> <span class="font-italic">Industries Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Agritrade International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 4 SLR 768, I observed that giving a party a reasonable opportunity to present its case means not only giving that party the opportunity to present the evidence and to advance propositions of law on which it <span class="font-italic">positively</span> relies to establish its case (“the positive aspect”), but also giving the party a reasonable opportunity to present the evidence and to advance propositions of law necessary to <span class="font-italic">respond</span> to the case made against it (“the responsive aspect”). If a tribunal adopts an important line of reasoning in its award without giving a party a reasonable opportunity to address that line of reasoning, that deprives the party of the responsive aspect of its right to be heard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Nonetheless, in line with the policy of minimal curial intervention, a tribunal’s failure to solicit submissions from the parties on <span class="font-italic">each and every</span> point for decision is not a ground for setting aside the award. I adopt the guidance of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span> (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) … Only in instances such as where the impugned decision reveals a dramatic departure from the submissions, or involves an arbitrator receiving extraneous evidence, or adopts a view wholly at odds with the established evidence adduced by the parties, or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by the parties as being trivial or irrelevant, might it be appropriate for a court to intervene. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) It is almost invariably the case that parties propose diametrically opposite solutions to resolve a dispute. They may expect the arbitrator to select one of these alternative positions. <span class="font-italic">The arbitrator, however, is not bound to adopt an either/or approach.</span> He is perfectly entitled to embrace a middle path (even without apprising the parties of his provisional thinking or analysis) so long as it is based on evidence that is before him. <span class="font-italic">Similarly, an arbitrator is entitled</span> – indeed, it is his obligation – <span class="font-italic">to come to his own conclusions or inferences from the primary facts placed before him. In this context, he </span><span class="font-italic">is not expected to inexorably accept the conclusions being urged upon him by the parties.</span> <span class="font-italic">Neither </span><span class="font-italic">is he expected to consult the parties on his thinking process before finalising his award unless it involves a dramatic departure from what has been presented to him.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, the parties also accept that even if a breach of natural justice is proven, it must be further demonstrated that the breach actually caused prejudice to the aggrieved party. In other words, the breach must have deprived the tribunal of arguments or evidence that had “a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to the final outcome of the arbitral proceedings in some meaningful way” (<span class="font-italic">ADG </span>at [148], citing<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 1 SLR 125).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Excess of jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On an application to set aside an award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law, the court must undertake a two-step inquiry and determine (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [40]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, what matters were within the scope of submission to the arbitral tribunal; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, whether the arbitral award involved such matters, or whether it involved “a new difference … outside the scope of the submission to arbitration and accordingly … <span class="font-italic">irrelevant to the issues requiring determination</span>” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In determining the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration, the pleadings filed in the arbitration provide a convenient way to define the jurisdiction of the tribunal (see <span class="font-italic">PT Prima International Development v </span><span class="font-italic">Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals</span> [2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Prima</span>”) at [33]). The pleadings must also, of course, be read in the context of the issues raised in the notice of arbitration or in the response to that notice. In general, the court will not take a narrow interpretation of the issues that have been submitted to the tribunal for determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I turn now to consider the merits of the respondent’s application.

Even though the respondent objected to the claimants’ attempt to change their case so fundamentally and at such a late stage, the tribunal added the newly-framed issue to the parties’ agreed list of issues in the arbitration and accepted the claimants’ submissions without giving the respondent an opportunity to respond to the new case against it.

In my view, it is not a clear or virtually inescapable inference that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to the respondent’s argument that the correspondence was inadmissible.

This must be why neither party expended the effort to advance a fully-fledged argument on the admissibility of the correspondence. In these circumstances, I consider it impossible to find, as a clear and virtually inescapable inference, that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to the issue of admissibility. I draw the inference instead that the tribunal made a decision to admit the correspondence in evidence – albeit implicitly rather than explicitly – without seeing a need to articulate its reasons for rejecting the respondent’s objections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is useful at this juncture to bear in mind the observations of Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima</span>”) on the scope of a tribunal’s duty to deal with arguments advanced by the parties (at [72]–[77]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 <span class="font-underline">An arbitral tribunal is not obliged to deal with every argument.</span> It is neither practical nor realistic to require otherwise.

This is not easy to define. <span class="font-underline">Notwithstanding, in my view, arbitral tribunals must be given fair latitude in determining what is essential and what is not.

As long as one argument resolves the issue, there is no justification for insisting that the arbitral tribunal go on to consider the other arguments which have been rendered academic. In <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 1 SLR 733 (“<span class="font-italic">SEF</span>”), Judith Prakash J held (at [60]) that “[n]atural justice requires that the parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions made”. I completely agree. It is the right to be heard and not a right to receive responses to all the submissions or arguments presented that is protected. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics and bold italics; emphasis added in underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86  I agree with these observations. A tribunal can legitimately take the view that an evidential issue which a party raises within the context of the many substantive issues before the tribunal and which the party does not develop with any real seriousness of intent, even if it raises the issue in this way repeatedly, is not essential for it to decide and therefore does not require separate or explicit analysis. Taking that view certainly does not amount to a failure to consider the issue entirely or to a deliberate avoidance of the issue, both of which would be grounds for a successful challenge to the award (see <span class="font-italic">ASG v ASH</span> [2016] 5 SLR 54 at [90]). For the reasons already given, there were reasonable grounds on which the tribunal may have arrived at the view that the objection to the admissibility of the correspondence was not an issue which was essential for it to decide. Accordingly, I reject the respondent’s submission that the tribunal, by reason only of its silence on the point in the award, must have failed entirely to apply its mind to the issue of admissibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In any case, even if the tribunal did fail to consider its objections to the admissibility of the correspondence, no prejudice was caused to the respondent. The requirement of prejudice, as the authorities cited at [64] above show, is aimed at ascertaining whether the breach could reasonably have made a difference to the outcome of the arbitration in some <span class="font-italic">meaningful</span> way. But in this case, the issue of admissibility of the correspondence is two steps removed from the tribunal’s finding that the respondent was liable for the Cost Overrun. To set aside the award on this ground, therefore, the respondent must succeed on both of those two steps. First, the respondent must establish that, had the tribunal applied its mind to the respondent’s objections to admissibility, it <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">ould</span> have ruled the correspondence to be inadmissible. And second, the respondent must establish that, having ruled the correspondence inadmissible, the tribunal <span class="font-italic">could</span> have found that the respondent was not liable for the Cost Overrun. For the reasons that follow, I find that the respondent fails at the second and more important step. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The respondent has incorrectly characterised the correspondence as going to the respondent’s <span class="font-italic">liability</span> for the Cost Overrun. I accept the claimants’ submission that the tribunal did not rely on the correspondence for its finding that the respondent was so liable.

The tribunal earlier interpreted cl 10.2.1 to mean that, if the respondent failed to achieve WCD by 31 March 2013, the first claimant could nonetheless permit the respond to remain in control of the Project and therefore remain liable for the accumulating Cost Overrun.

</div> Nonetheless, the fact remains that the claimants did not plead their case on the basis that their entitlement to recover the Cost Overrun was predicated on a breach of the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Further, I find that the respondent understood the true nature of the claimants’ case on the Cost Overrun. That is why the respondent pleaded in its statement of defence, by way of response to the claimants’ amended statement of claim, that the respondent could not be liable for the Cost Overrun unless it was first found to be in breach of the SPA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">135. The references to Clause 9.1.4 and Clause 10.2.4 of the SPA in Para 106 of the Claims Statement and the conclusions sought to be drawn on the basis of the same, are simplistic, and not based on a meaningful reading of the terms of the SPA. As evident …, the Claimants’ case is premised on the basis that cost overrun is a consequence of the delay in achieving Wet Commissioning Date, and given the alleged failures and additional time taken to achieve Wet Commissioning Date, additional Project Costs have been incurred. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">137. Without prejudice to this position, and while reiterating that [the first claimant] cannot have a claim outside these provisions, <span class="font-italic">whether as alleged losses flowing from a breach, or in terms of an indemnity provision, </span>even assuming such a claim can be raised, <span class="font-italic">[the first claimant] must necessarily establish</span> <span class="font-italic">that it was [the respondent’s] default or breach which delayed the achievement of Wet Commissioning and that their claims arose as a direct consequence of such breach</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The respondent’s pleaded case, in short, was that whether the Cost Overrun was claimed as damages flowing from a breach of the SPA or as a contractual liability to indemnify arising under the SPA, the claimants had to demonstrate “default or breach which delayed the achievement of Wet Commissioning” on the respondent’s part in order to recover the Cost Overrun. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 This is not a situation where the respondent misunderstood the claimants’ case. The respondent well understood the claimants’ case and chose to defend itself by arguing that, as a matter of law, even its contractual liability for the Cost Overrun required proof that it was in breach of the SPA by delaying the WCD. In other words, the respondent defended the claimant’s true case on the Cost Overrun by taking the <span class="font-italic">contrary</span> position: that its liability required a breach of the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the same reason, even if the respondent <span class="font-italic">did</span> misunderstand the claimants’ case and <span class="font-italic">did</span> believe it to be premised on a breach of the SPA, the respondent nonetheless had an adequate opportunity to respond to that case and did respond to that case. There was therefore no prejudice to the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I add that even if it were the case that the respondent realised, only on 26 January 2017, that the true basis of the claimants’ Cost Overrun claim was a claim on an indemnity without proof of prior breach, the respondent still had a reasonable opportunity to present its case on this point. The significance of 26 January 2017 is that it was the last day of the oral submissions to the tribunal.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The four months between the conclusion of the oral submissions and the close of the written submissions was a large and reasonable window of opportunity for the respondent to develop and present a response on the Cost Overrun liability, even if it was genuinely taken by surprise by a new position. The respondent claims that, if given the chance, it would have made full arguments on a particular provision of the contracts legislation of Lemuria. But there is no reason why it could not have sought permission to advance those full arguments to the tribunal in the four months between January 2017 and May 2017. Any submissions on the Lemurian legislation would have turned on matters of pure law and would not have required reopening the discovery phase or the evidential phase of the arbitration. The parties could easily have dealt with the issue in written submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Even if it had proven necessary to reopen discovery or the evidential phase, the respondent had more than a reasonable opportunity to seek directions from the tribunal to that effect and to be heard on the substance of the issue. The respondent made no attempt to do this. The tribunal proved itself receptive to the second respondent’s request for a further submission in May 2017. That indicates to me that, even in May 2017, the tribunal had <span class="font-italic">not</span> closed its mind to requests by the parties to be heard further on the matters before it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Accordingly, I find that the respondent was not deprived of a reasonable opportunity to respond to this aspect of its Cost Overrun liability. It had that reasonable opportunity and simply chose not to take it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 For the same reasons, I find that the tribunal did not exceed its jurisdiction in finding that the respondent’s liability for the Cost Overrun did not depend on establishing that the respondent was in breach of the SPA. The tribunal correctly apprehended the true basis of the claimants’ case on why it was entitled to recover the Cost Overrun from the respondent. That this required the tribunal to insert a new question into the parties’ Agreed List of Issues does not, in and of itself, mean that the tribunal overstepped the boundaries of what the parties had submitted to it for resolution. The tribunal’s jurisdiction includes not only issues specifically presented to it in the pleadings but also those questions of fact and law that arise (whether expressly or impliedly) from the pleadings (see <span class="font-italic">PT Prima </span>at [34]). Accordingly, the tribunal was acting perfectly within the scope of its authority in framing and answering the question of whether liability for Cost Overrun arose only upon breach by the respondent or independently of any such breach, simply by the Project costs exceeding $170m. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Quantification of components of Cost Overrun</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I turn now to consider the respondent’s challenges to the tribunal’s quantification of its Cost Overrun liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The tribunal limited the respondent’s liability to Cost Overrun incurred up to 30 June 2014. That was the date on which the tribunal found the Project would have achieved WCD if the claimants had fulfilled their obligation under cl 9.10(a) of the SPA to complete the Project in the “most prudent and cost effective manner”. Quantifying the respondent’s liability therefore meant that the tribunal had to adjust the quantum of the Cost Overrun which the claimants sought to recover to account for the shorter period over which the respondent was liable for the Cost Overrun:

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I disagree with the claimants’ final point. In fairness to the respondent, it could not have known when making its submissions that it should also challenge the Cost Overrun components <span class="font-italic">in relation to whether they were </span><span class="font-italic">time-dependent</span>. It is not reasonable and not realistic to suggest that the respondent could have challenged any of the methods by which the tribunal could ultimately have chosen to slice up the recoverability of these components and therefore had a reasonable opportunity to respond to each of those possible methods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Nonetheless, on balance, I find that there was no breach of natural justice on this aspect of the challenge. It is true that a tribunal “should not come to decisions which surprise the parties”: <span class="font-italic">AUF v AUG</span> <span class="font-italic">and other matters </span>[2016] 1 SLR 859 (“<span class="font-italic">AUF</span>”) at [69]. But that general principle is qualified by another proposition – that a tribunal is not required to invite submissions on every point necessary for its decision: <span class="font-italic">AUF</span> at [70]. The situation in which the tribunal reaches a final position which rests somewhere in the vast gulf between the two parties’ polar opposites in their pleaded cases is not uncommon. As was said in <span class="font-italic">Carillion Construction Limited v Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1358 (at [35]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is often not practicable for an adjudicator to put to the parties his provisional conclusions for comment. Very often those provisional conclusions will represent some intermediate position, for which neither party was contending. It will only be in an exceptional case … that an adjudicator’s failure to put his provisional conclusions to the parties will constitute such a serious breach of the rules of natural justice that the Court will decline to enforce his decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As I understand this aspect of the respondent’s challenge, it is not finding fault with tribunal’s finding that the respondent’s liability for the Cost Overrun terminated on 30 June 2014. Indeed, the respondent cannot complain about that finding because it <span class="font-italic">reduce</span><span class="font-italic">d</span> the respondent’s liability for the Cost Overrun. So the respondent is driven to contending, simply, that as a <span class="font-italic">result</span> of this finding, the tribunal ought not to have gone on to decide of its own accord how to classify each of the Cost Overrun components as time-dependent or not. Instead, it should have given the parties a reasonable opportunity to present their respective cases on time-dependence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122  There is a delicate balance between upholding a party’s right to have a reasonable opportunity to respond to the case against it and affording enough latitude to a tribunal to reach decisions without being unduly hindered by the need to refer every point to the parties for argument. I fall back on the comprehensive summation of the law by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span> (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Parties to arbitration have, in general, a right to be heard effectively on every issue that may be relevant to the resolution of a dispute. The overriding concern, as Goff LJ aptly noted in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vimeira</span> ([46] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), is fairness. The best rule of thumb to adopt is to treat the parties equally and allow them reasonable opportunities to present their cases as well as to respond. An arbitrator should not base his decision(s) on matters not submitted or argued before him. In other words, an arbitrator should not make bricks without straw. Arbitrators who exercise unreasonable initiative without the parties’ involvement may attract serious and sustainable challenges.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Fairness, however, is a multidimensional concept and it would also be unfair to the successful party if it were deprived of the fruits of its labour as a result of a dissatisfied party raising a multitude of arid technical challenges after an arbitral award has been made. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) It is almost invariably the case that parties propose diametrically opposite solutions to resolve a dispute.

Whether the tribunal made an error in using the figure of $145m as the baseline for issuing a Cost Overrun notice turns on an interpretation of cl 9.7 of the SPA. On the face of cl 9.7 of the SPA, it refers to Cost Overrun “[as] contemplated in Clause 9.1.4”, which takes into consideration the various loans and security bonds already paid by the respondent into the second claimant. As both parties accept, the amount in cl 9.1.4 adds up to $170m.

The parties in this case submitted both liability for the Cost Overrun and the quantum of that liability to the tribunal for determination.

</div> The claimants’ case, on the other hand, was that the respondent was not entitled to recover the SSL in the first place because the conditions precedent for recovery, found in cl 9.1 of the SPA, were not satisfied.

The relevant part of cl 9.7 reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event of Cost Overrun contemplated in Clause 9.1.4, [the first claimant] or [the second claimant] shall notify [the respondent] (<span class="font-weight-bold">Cost Overrun Notice</span>) to provide such amounts to the [second claimant], as is necessary to meet the Cost Overrun. <span class="font-italic">If within 14 (fourteen) Business Days of the receipt of the Cost Overrun Notice, [the respondent] fails to pay to [the second claimant] the amount specified in the Cost Overrun Notice,</span> <span class="font-italic">the Sellers’ Subordinated Loans from or repayable to [the respondent] shall forthwith stand reduced in the books of [the </span><span class="font-italic">second claimant] by such amount as is specified in the Cost Overrun Notice</span>. … [emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The respondent failed to pay a Cost Overrun notice dated 16 October 2013 calling for payment of $9.6m. As a result, the tribunal found that the entire SSL, amounting to $5.1m, stood adjusted towards the amount specified in that Cost Overrun notice under cl 9.7. That extinguished the SSL entirely. There was therefore no question thereafter of the respondent ever recovering the SSL.

It comes after the tribunal had already made its primary finding that the respondent’s right to recover the SSL stood extinguished under cl 9.7 of the SPA because the respondent had failed to comply with the Cost Overrun notice issued in October 2013.

Following from the tribunal’s finding on the Cost Overrun claim, the tribunal took the WCD to be 30 June 2014. The tribunal accordingly held the respondent liable for all BPTA charges incurred up to that date.

I do not consider it a clear and virtually inescapable inference that the tribunal, having taken account of the evidence supporting the BPTA Charges paid from May 2014 onwards in making a finding on those charges, must in the same breath have overlooked the need for documentary evidence for the earlier BPTA Charges. The more likely inference is that the tribunal implicitly concluded that the claimants’ claim for $3.3m for the period before February 2014 was also borne out on the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The entire tenor of the respondent’s case on the BPTA Charges claim is that the tribunal, by finding against the respondent despite what the respondent believed to be a compelling case, <span class="font-italic">must</span> have overlooked the respondent’s arguments on the issue.

</div>
</div>
</div> In particular, the respondent made no submission as to the date from which pre-award interest should run if, contrary to the respondent’s only submission, the tribunal found the respondent liable for pre-award interest. The commencement date for pre-award interest was therefore not a point which the respondent put in issue before the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 It is clear from s 20(1) of the IAA that the award of interest is a matter entirely at the tribunal’s discretion. Interest may be awarded “from such date, at such rate and with such rest as the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate”. The tribunal was entitled to grant pre-award interest in its discretion commencing from a date that it considered appropriate. Its omission to give reasons for choosing the date does not render this part of its award vulnerable to being set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In any event, 4 July 2014, the date which the tribunal selected as the commencement date for pre-award interest, has legal significance. It was obviously not plucked from the air. As the tribunal itself noted, it is the date on which the claimants sent legal notice of the Cost Overrun claim and the BPTA Charges claim to the respondent. The date has a manifest and rational connection to the dispute before the tribunal. It was well within the tribunal’s discretion to choose this date as the commencement date for pre-award interest. I see no basis for finding that it acted in breach of natural justice in doing so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the respondent’s application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 For all of these reasons, I reject all of the respondent’s challenges to the tribunal’s decision on both the Cost Overrun claim and the BPTA Charges claim. Consequently, there is no basis to interfere with the tribunal’s rejection of the respondent’s counterclaim for amounts related to the Cost Overrun claim, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the respondent’s counterclaim for the refund of Security Bond I and for the repayment of $1.2m. There is also no basis to set aside any part of the tribunal’s award in favour of the claimants on interest and costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Having disposed of the respondent’s setting-aside application, I now turn to the claimants’ application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claimants’ application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The claimants’ settting-aside application is a focused challenge to a single finding of the tribunal: that the WCD should be taken to be 30 June 2014 rather than 31 October 2015. The consequence of this finding is that the claimants’ right to recover the Cost Overrun and the BPTA Charges terminated on 30 June 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 To recapitulate, many of the Project’s delays flowed from the defective penstock. When the first claimant formally took control of the Project in March 2014, it analysed various remedial options. It chose to reline large sections of the penstock with a secondary steel lining. The tribunal found that re-welding the affected sections of the penstock was both a faster and a cheaper option than re-lining the penstock. In other words, the tribunal found that re-welding was the most prudent and cost-effective manner of completing the Project. The tribunal also found that, had the claimants simply re-welded, the Project would have been wet commissioned by 30 June 2014.

As a result, the tribunal deprived the claimants of the opportunity to make submissions on this issue and went beyond the parties’ submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rectifying penstock defects</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 I deal first with the contention at [171(a)].

To the tribunal, it did not matter if the claimants’ key contention (that the re-lining method was indeed the best repair option for the long-term structural integrity of the penstock) was correct. On the tribunal’s analysis, re-lining the penstock was an improvement on the original design and specifications and not a repair to conform the penstock with the original design and specifications. The claimants undertook this improvement for their own account. It was not an expense within the respondent’s liability for the Cost Overrun. In this light, the obvious conclusion is that the tribunal saw no need to engage with the claimants’ evidence on what the tribunal saw to be an irrelevant point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Even if I am wrong on the inference to be drawn from this part of the award, the claimants still fail on the requirement of prejudice.

</div> to its logical conclusion, even if the tribunal took account of the claimants’ evidence summarised at [170] above, there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> possibility that the chain of reasoning which the tribunal actually adopted could have permitted it to accept re-lining as the appropriate repair method for the penstock within the contractual terms of the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 This is sufficient for me to dismiss the claimants’ arguments on the tribunal’s alleged failure to consider its evidence on the penstock repair. Nonetheless, I would also observe that there are indications in the award that the tribunal did not in fact fail to consider the evidence in question. The claimants suggest that the tribunal completely overlooked the 30 December 2013 report by the first claimant’s Vice-President. In fact, the tribunal expressly cited the report in its award.

</div> The claimants’ argument seeks to draw a fine distinction. They say that the tribunal absorbed only the <span class="font-italic">cost</span> analysis from the Vice-President’s report which acknowledged that the re-welding method was the faster and cheaper option, but not the <span class="font-italic">risk </span>analysis which concluded that the more technically sustainable solution was still the re-lining method.

</div> This argument is wholly unconvincing. I do not find it a clear and virtually inescapable inference that the tribunal would have read and noted the details and cost analysis of the four repair options, while ignoring the risk analysis for each option. I note that the risk analysis appears in the very next line of the report.

</div> A possible explanation is that the tribunal believed that in assessing the earliest time that the Project could be completed, if the claimant had employed the most prudent and cost effective method, any ongoing transmission line works (which were the obligation of the <span class="font-italic">second </span>respondent) were of no factual or legal relevance. It is true that the tribunal may have been wrong on this. But if so, it is merely an error of fact or law.

In my view, it is at least equally plausible that the tribunal – having noted that the execution<span class="font-italic"> </span>of transmission line works was not the first respondent’s obligation – did not think that the time needed to complete the other components would be relevant to ascertaining the first respondent’s Cost Overrun liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I therefore dismiss this aspect of the claimant’s setting-aside application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Opportunity to be heard on the Project completion date</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Finally, the claimants argue that the tribunal’s finding that, had the claimants completed the Project in the most prudent and cost effective manner, the Project would have been completed by 30 June 2014 was a finding that the claimants could not have expected and had no opportunity to address. Accordingly, the claimants were deprived of a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on why the Project could <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been completed by 30 June 2014.

First, the claimants’ position that it was deprived of a chance to argue that the Project could not have been completed by 30 June 2014 is inconsistent with its argument above (at [171(c)]) that, on the arguments and evidence<span class="font-italic"> </span>submitted on transmission line works, it should have been apparent that the Project could have been completed no earlier than 17 October 2015. If the relevant evidence was already before the tribunal, there can be no argument that a party was deprived of the chance to present new material that could have a meaningful chance of making a difference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Further, the tribunal’s calculation of three to four months was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a number plucked from the air. Ironically, it was based on the claimants’ own evidence. In the 30 December 2013 report from the claimants’ Vice-President (summarised above at [173(a)]), in assessing the viability of the four repair options for the penstock, he estimated that the re-welding method had a “[p]rogramme estimate [of] 4 months”.

They must accept the consequences of that choice. There is no right of appeal from an arbitral award covered by the IAA. There is only a right to apply to set aside an award on limited grounds.
