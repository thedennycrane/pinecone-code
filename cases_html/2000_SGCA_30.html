</strong>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><em><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Cur Adv Vult</strong></font></em><b><u></u></b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    These two appeals

arose from the claim of Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd, the plaintiffs, against Seah Chwee

Lim, the defendant, for damages for professional negligence. In the court below, the

defendant admitted the negligence complained of but maintained that his negligence did not

cause any loss to the plaintiffs or alternatively that the plaintiffs had contributed to

the loss. The trial judge found that the defendant’s negligence did cause the

plaintiffs to suffer some losses and that there was no contributory negligence on the part

of the plaintiffs. He awarded the plaintiffs only certain items of the loss claimed by

them. Against his decision both the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed, and we propose

to deal with both of their appeals together in this judgment. For convenience, we shall

continue to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendant respectively.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The facts</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    In April 1993, two of

the directors of the plaintiffs, Azam Ali and Chow Kwok Seng (‘Chow’), were

interested in purchasing the property, No. 13 Jalan Besar (‘the property’). They

caused a search to be made at the Registry of Deeds and found that there was executed a

deed of appointment of trustees in relation to the property. Azam Ali then got in touch

with one of the trustees, Syed Salim Alhadad bin Syed Ahmad Alhadad (‘Syed

Salim’), who referred him to his nephew Syed Jafaralsadeq bin Abdul Kadir

(‘Jafar’). Azam Ali met Jafar and negotiated with the latter for the purchase of

the property. Eventually they agreed on a purchase price of $550,000. Arising from the

negotiations, the plaintiffs on 29 May 1993 were granted an option to purchase the

property by Syed Ibrahim bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad, Syed Hashim bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad and

Syed Salim (collectively referred to as ‘the Vendors’), acting as the personal

representatives of the estate of Syed Abdulkadir bin Ahmad Alhadad (‘Syed

Abdulkadir’).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    On 31 May 1993, Azam

Ali and Chow saw the defendant and showed him the option they had obtained and instructed

him to act for the plaintiffs in the intended purchase of the property. The defendant did

not appear to have taken any step in relation to the option. The plaintiffs exercised the

option on 22 June 1993, and only thenceforth the defendant carried out a search on the

property. He was not satisfied with the result of the search, as it did not show that the

title to the property was vested in the estate of Syed Abdulkadir. On the following day,

he wrote to G Balan Nair &amp; Co (‘Balan Nair’), who were the solicitors for

the Vendors, stating his finding that there was a break in the chain of title and

requested Balan Nair to explain how the Vendors as the personal representatives of the

estate of Syed Abdulkadir were able to sell the property. On 30 June 1993, Balan Nair

replied without however dealing specifically with this query. They informed the defendant

that the sale was subject to the Vendors obtaining an order of court under s 35(2) of the

Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61). However, the defendant was not satisfied

with the reply, and he further wrote to Balan Nair on 1 July 1993 stating, inter alia,

that the court order would not cure the ‘bad root’ of title and, even if

granted, might not be good for the purpose, and that the Vendors might not be the actual

trustees of the proprietor of the property. He requested Balan Nair to forward the draft

affidavits of the trustees in support of the application for the order so that he could

ascertain their rights in seeking the order of court for the sale of the property to the

plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    A copy of the

defendant’s letter was sent to the plaintiffs. On receipt, Azam Ali forwarded a copy

to Jafar. Jafar replied directly to Azam Ali, assuring him thus:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We have done title search on the said

  property and you do not have to worry about anything, as the sale shall be sanction [sic]

  by the Court. Please be informed that we are selling the said property as the legal owner

  and you and your lawyer should not worry unnecessarily about who is the equitable owner,

  that is our family internal matter with the Basalamah families.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">After all the sale proceed [sic] shall be

  held in Trust Account with our lawyers after the sale.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    Azam Ali subsequently

spoke to the defendant on 6 July 1993 and the latter made an attendance note of the

conversation as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Azam Ali said the trustees have said

  they have powers to sell. The rest are internal matter. All beneficiaries will sign.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Ali said trustees offended. I told him

  I had no intention to do so. It is entirely up to trustees to satisfy themselves of the

  status. I owed Purchaser a duty.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    The defendant,

nevertheless, continued to seek clarification on the Vendor’s title. He wrote to

Balan Nair on 13 July 1993 asking for a copy of the draft affidavit in support of the

Vendor’s pending application under s 35(2) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property

Act. Balan Nair declined this request on 4 August 1993 stating that he would only provide

the defendant with a copy of the court order. The defendant then spoke to Azam Ali again

on 6 August 1993 and thereafter made the following note:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Ali said he has read the fax of 4.8.93

  by G. Balan Nair &amp; Co.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. I told him since the Vendor’s

  solicitors are adamant about it, we don’t have a choice but to hope for the best.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. There is no contractual term for us to

  peruse the affidavit first. Ali said ‘ok’ - let it be.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Don’t offend the Vendors or their

  solicitors.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    In the meanwhile, the

defendant received copies of the title deeds on 14 July 1993. On perusing the deeds, he

realised that there was a break in the title of the Vendors to the property and that the

plaintiffs on completion would not receive a proper title. Nonetheless, he did not bring

this to the attention of Azam Ali or the other directors of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    Eventually, Balan

Nair forwarded a copy of the order of court dated 27 August 1993 and the affidavit in

support of the application for the order. The affidavit did not provide any answer as to

how the Vendors became entitled to sell the property. Nevertheless, the defendant took no

further action on receiving these documents, even though he had earlier taken the view

that the court order would not cure the ‘bad root’ of title. He did not advise

the plaintiffs’ directors not to complete the purchase on the ground that the Vendors

had no title to the property. In the result, the plaintiffs went ahead and completed the

purchase of the property on 15 October 1993.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    Approximately two to

three months later, the plaintiffs applied to Tat Lee Bank Ltd (‘the Bank’) for

a loan on the security of a mortgage of the property. Shook Lin &amp; Bok

(‘SLB’) were instructed to act for the Bank as well as the plaintiffs in the

proposed mortgage, and Mr Lim Choo Eng (‘Mr Lim’) of SLB was the solicitor in

charge of the matter. After making a search, Mr Lim wrote to the defendant on 31 January

1994, stating that the Vendors did not have the capacity to sell the property, as they had

not obtained the grant of the letters of administration de bonis non to the estate of

Mohamed bin Ali bin Faraj Basalamah (‘the Basalamah estate’) and that the deed

of assignment of the property was ineffectual to transfer the property to the plaintiffs.

However, no copy of this letter was sent to the plaintiffs and they were not apprised of

the problem. Only in or around February 1994, when Azam Ali called Mr Lim enquiring about

the progress of the loan application, were the plaintiffs informed of the problem with

regard to the title arising from the absence of letters of administration de bonis non.

Following from that conversation, Chow approached the defendant who promised to resolve

the matter with Mr Lim. However, there was no solution to the problem, and the application

for the loan was eventually refused by the Bank on or about 27 December 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    In the meanwhile,

the plaintiffs had very much earlier instructed Palakrishnan &amp; Partners

(‘P &amp; P") to recover possession of the property from the tenants.

In fact soon after the completion of the purchase, on 29 October 1993, P &amp; P made an

application on behalf of the plaintiffs to the Tenants Compensation Board under the

Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act (Cap 60) to recover such possession. A date

for the hearing of the application was fixed for 22 April 1994. However, before the

hearing, the plaintiffs reached a settlement with the two tenants of the property and the

application was subsequently withdrawn. On the basis of the settlement, compensations

amounting to a total sum of $54,500 were paid on 28 and 30 June 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    P &amp; P were also

instructed to look into the problem relating to the title of the property. After having

conducted a title search on the property and a probate search, they wrote to Balan Nair on

30 June 1994:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We note that your clients are not the

  individuals whom the Grant of Letters of Administration of the Estate of [Basalamah], the

  owner of the property, had been granted. Our searches show no trace, as well, of any Grant

  of Letters of Administration De Bonis Non having been granted to your clients, so as to

  permit them to sell the property to our clients.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Please let us know whether your clients

  have taken any steps to obtain a Grant of Letters of Administration de Bonis Non so that

  our client’s title to the property may be rectified. If so, please let us know the

  Probate No. of the application, and if not, please advise your clients to rectify the

  problem forthwith.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    Balan Nair replied

that they had since closed the file and were no longer acting for the Vendors and

suggested that the query should be made to them direct. P &amp; P instead wrote to the

defendant on 28 July 1994, informing him that, in their view, the title to the property

had not passed to the plaintiffs as the Vendors were not the administrators of the

Basalamah estate, the owner of the property. They requested for a satisfactory explanation

from the defendant. The defendant replied on 1 August and 19 October 1994 maintaining that

so long as the court order stood it could not be said that the Vendors had no power to

sell the property to the plaintiffs and to pass a good title effectively to the

plaintiffs, and concluded thus:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. We conclude that the title as it stands

  in the records registry of the Registry of Titles and Deeds is a good title, in spite of

  the fact that the personal representatives of the Estate of Mohamed Bin Ali Bin Faraj

  Basalamah did not have a Grant of Letters of Administration De Bonis Non. Justice Lai Kew

  Chai must have taken judicial notice of that when he granted the Order on 27 Aug 93.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">P &amp; P were not persuaded, and they

wrote to the Vendors on 27 October 1994 repeating their views on the deficiency in the

Vendors’ title to the property. They requested the latter to provide either a copy of

any grant of letters of administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate or other

satisfactory evidence of their power to sell the property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    The Vendors then

instructed Netto Tan &amp; S Magin who wrote to P &amp; P on 12 November 1994 stating that

their clients had instructed them to apply for a vesting order, and that they were in the

process of preparing the application. They further stated, in the alternative, that the

Vendors offered to repay all the monies paid by the plaintiffs, without interest, in

exchange for the plaintiffs taking all the necessary steps to divest themselves of

whatever interest they had acquired in the property. However, no application was filed by

Netto Tan &amp; S Margin and the plaintiffs did not accept the alternative offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    It appeared that on

21 December 1994, Peter Pang &amp; Co initiated proceedings in Originating Summons No. 787

of 1993 on behalf of the Vendors for an order that, further to the order dated 27 August

1993, the property be vested in the applicants as trustees. P &amp; P became aware of the

application and wrote to Peter Pang &amp; Co on 25 January 1995, stating that it was

imperative that the Vendors highlight all the objections to title made by SLB and

themselves at the hearing fixed for 27 January 1995, and reiterating that the Vendors

could not have given good title without a grant of letters of administration de bonis non.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    In the meanwhile, on

16 September 1994, the letters of administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate were

in fact granted to one Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff (‘Syed Alsagoff’), who was the

attorney of Shaik Ahmad bin Mohamed bin Ali Basalamah and Shaik Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali

Basalamah, the sons and beneficiaries of the estate. The letters of administration were

issued on 22 November 1994 and registered against the property on 26 January 1995.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    On 2 March 1995, the

plaintiffs instructed P &amp; P to seek an opinion on their title to the property from Mr

H M Dyne (‘Mr Dyne’), a senior conveyancing lawyer. Mr Dyne gave his opinion on

17 March 1995 which was to the effect that (a) the order dated 27 August 1993 was clearly

a nullity as the Vendors had misrepresented their status in the ex-parte application, (b)

that a grant of letters of administration de bonis non was required to continue with the

administration of the Estate, and (c) that no title had passed to the plaintiffs. Mr Dyne

also advised in general terms some steps or actions the plaintiffs should take with a view

to seeking a proper title to the property. However, no step or action appeared to have

been taken by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    About two months

later, on 8 May 1995, Syed Alsagoff instituted proceedings in Originating Summons No 437

of 1995 (‘O S No. 437 of 1995’) against the Vendors and plaintiffs seeking to

set aside the sale. The application was heard before Warren Khoo J, and he held that the

Vendors had no capacity, merely as trustees of Syed Abdulkadir’s estate, to sell the

property in the absence of a grant of letters of administration de bonis non over the

Basalamah estate in their favour and accordingly he set aside the sale. He also rejected

the defences of acquiescence and laches raised by the plaintiffs: see <i>Syed Ali Redha

Alsagoff (administrator of the estate of Mohamed bin Ali, deceased) v Syed Salim Alhadad </i><nobr>[1996] 3 SLR 410</nobr>. Against that decision, the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal and the

appeal was dismissed: <i>Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd v Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff and Ors</i>
<nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 13</nobr>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    Following the

dismissal of their appeal, the plaintiffs instituted the present action against the

defendant claiming damages for breach of contract and/or negligence in failing to advise

them that the Vendors had no capacity to convey the property and that no title would pass

to them on completion of the sale. There was no claim for the refund of the purchase price

paid for the property, as that had been refunded to them by the time the action commenced.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The decision below</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    Before the trial

judge, the defendant admitted that he was negligent in omitting to advise the plaintiffs

that the Vendors had no capacity to sell the property as they did not have the grant of

letters of administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate. The learned judge found

that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs and allowed, inter

alia, the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) damages arising from the loss of the

  property to be assessed by the registrar, the measure of such loss being the increase in

  value of the property without vacant possession as at 17 July 1996 over the contract

  price, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6 % from the date of the issue of the

  writ to the date of judgment;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) two thirds of the costs of the action.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The learned judge rejected the following

claims of the plaintiffs:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) the sum of $54,500 paid to the tenants

  of the property as compensation for delivering of vacant possession of the property;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the sum of $5,416.39 being the costs

  paid to P &amp; P in respect of the application to the Tenants Compensation Board;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) the solicitor and client costs of the

  plaintiffs in defending the claim in O S No 437 of 1995 and the party and party costs

  incurred in the two applications in those proceedings and the costs for attending taxation

  of the party and party costs in O S No 437 of 1995.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The appeals</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    The plaintiffs

appeal against the dismissal of the above claims, and the defendant appeals against the

trial judge’s finding that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the

plaintiffs and against the basis of assessment of general damages as awarded by the

learned judge. The issues before us are essentially the following, namely: (a) whether

there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs; (b) the measure of

damages for assessment before the registrar; (c) whether the plaintiffs are entitled to

recover the amounts of compensation paid to the tenants of the property for delivery of

vacant possession; (d) whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the costs paid to

their solicitors in respect of the application to the Tenants Compensation Board; and (e)

whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their costs in O S No. 437 of 1995.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Contributory negligence</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    On the issue of

contributory negligence, counsel for the defendant relies essentially on what the

plaintiffs’ director, Azam Ali, did with regard to the defendant’s attempt or

effort to conduct investigation on the property. It was in evidence that, on 6 July and 4

August 1993, after the defendant had written to the Vendors’ solicitors raising

questions on the Vendors’ title to the property, Azam Ali spoke to the defendant and,

among other things, instructed the defendant not to offend the Vendors. Counsel contends

that this instruction, considered in the proper context, was tantamount to an interference

in the defendant’s investigation of title, and thus impeded his investigation. By

this instruction Azam Ali had caused the defendant to cease or ease up on the

investigation. It is said that the defendant understood the instruction to mean not to

probe further into the Vendors’ title to the property. It is also said that Azam Ali

in fact admonished him for investigating title, because Azam Ali himself was satisfied

with the Vendors’ explanations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    The learned judge

found that there was no undue pressure exerted on defendant by Azam Ali in the

latter’s instruction not to offend the Vendors, and even if there were, that did not

relieve the defendant from his duty to investigate and advise the plaintiffs accordingly.

Neither were the defendant’s investigations on title thereby impeded. The learned

judge said at  66-68 of his judgement:</font></p>

  and sensitivity, but he should not stop carrying out his duties.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    The learned judge

was plainly right, and we agree with him entirely. First, the attendance notes made by the

defendant in respect of the conversations between him and Azam Ali on 6 July and 4 August

1993 did not reveal any indication that Azam Ali did not require the defendant to carry

out the investigations which he had initiated. Based on the notes, it appeared to us that,

so far as relevant, substantially what Azam Ali did was to inform him that the trustees

were offended by his enquiry as to their title to the property and to request him not to

offend them. Such a request certainly was not, and could not in any sense be construed by

the defendant to be, an instruction by Azam Ali that the defendant should not carry out

his investigation on the title to the property which he was obliged to do. Secondly, the

defendant’s record showed that Azam Ali had authorised him to obtain copies of all

the title deeds to the property. There was no note recorded by the defendant which shows

either expressly or by necessary implication that Azam Ali had given him any instruction

to the effect that he was to desist from making any investigation on the title or other

important aspects of the property, which was central to his duty acting as the solicitor

for the purchaser of a property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    It is significant

that after the conversation with Azam Ali on 6 July 1993, the defendant continued with his

enquiry of the proposed application for the order under s 35(2) of the Conveyancing

and the Law of Property Act and the efficacy of the proposed order of court and hence the

capacity and power of the Vendors to sell. In particular, he sought a copy of the

affidavit in support of the application for the order. If indeed there were instructions

from Azam Ali to accept the Vendors’ assurance concerning the title to the property,

there would be no reason for repeating the same request to view the affidavit in support.

We are thus reinforced in our view that the defendant never considered Azam Ali’s

instruction to mean that he should cease or suspend his investigations on the property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    It is difficult to

understand how the instructions given by Azam Ali could amount to an interference, such

that it impeded the duty of the defendant to investigate the property and to advise his

clients. What the defendant appears to suggest is that he was impeded in discharging his

duties because Azam Ali was anxious to complete the purchase and thus was unconcerned

about the technicalities as to the title of the property. In response, we hasten to say

this. If that were true, it would make his duty to advise the plaintiffs of the

consequences all the more imperative. Where a solicitor relies on his client’s

express instructions as a defence to a claim for negligence, he must show that he has

provided adequate advice to his client before acting on the client’s instructions: <i>Jackson

&amp; Powell on Professional Negligence</i> (1997) at para 4-93. In this case, of course,

the plaintiffs were anxious to acquire the property. However, they were entitled to expect

that, even in the face of such anxiety, the defendant would conduct the investigations on

the property adequately as a solicitor and advise them accordingly. In our judgment, there

was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    The defendant was

not deprived of any relevant information because of the conduct of the plaintiffs

allegedly preventing him from rendering this advice. He received copies of the affidavit

and title deeds from Balan Nair. From the letters he wrote to Balan Nair, it seems to us

that at all material times he formed the view that the plaintiffs on completion would not

be getting any title or interest in the property and the problem would not be resolved by

the court order which was being sought by the Vendors. Unfortunately, notwithstanding

this, he failed to advise the plaintiffs against the purchase of the property.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Damages</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    In the court below,

the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, damages as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) loss of the property and the wasted

  expenses in purchasing the same including (but not limited to) the difference between the

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) alternatively, the loss of

  opportunity to purchase a property similar to the Property for the same or a similar

  price.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The trial judge dealt with this claim at

 74 and 75 of his judgment as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">74. … How is the damages for this

  loss to be measured? The plaintiffs submitted that it should be the difference between the

  original contract price and the market price when the purchase failed, and cited <i>Stinchcombe

  &amp; Coope Ltd v Addison Cooper, Jesson &amp; Co</i> <nobr>[1971] 115 SJ 368</nobr> as authority. The

  defendant contended that it should be the difference between the contract price and the

  market price at February 1994 when Azam Ali first heard of the title defect in the title

  from Mr Lim because the plaintiffs have mitigated their loss and should have taken steps

  to acquire alternative premises immediately.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">75. I accept the plaintiffs’

  position. When Mr Lim informed Azam Ali of the problem with the title, that could have

  been rectified if the necessary grant de bonis non was obtained. The difference between

  the positions of the plaintiffs and the defendant is the factual issue when the purchase

  failed, and I find that it failed when it was set aside.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Later the learned judge concluded thus at

 80:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">80. I find that the damages should be the

  increase in the value of the property without vacant possession as at 17 July 1996 over

  the contract price. As there was no evidence adduced on this, it shall be assessed by the

  registrar.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    The arguments before

us, as were before the learned judge, are directed at the correct date to be taken for the

purpose of assessing the measure of damages. Very briefly, counsel for the defendant

argues that 17 July 1996, as determined by the learned judge, is not correct as the

adoption of that date is inconsistent with the learned judge’s decision that it was

unreasonable for the plaintiffs to defend O S 437 of 1995, and hence they could not

recover the costs incurred in that action. The plaintiffs were not justified in deferring

seeking alternative premises until the judgment was delivered. The purchase failed <i>ab

initio</i>, because the Vendors had no title to the property, and damages ought to be

assessed as at the date of completion. As the plaintiffs eventually recovered the purchase

price, there was no further assessable loss. Alternatively, it is argued that the

appropriate date for the assessment should be either 31 January 1994 or 12 November 1994.

With regard to the former, that was the date when Mr Lim of SLB wrote to the defendant

stating, among other things, that the Vendors had no capacity to sell the property and

that the title to the property had not passed to the plaintiffs. There was no evidence

that the sale could have been rectified then by a grant of letters of administration de

bonis non in favour of the Vendors. As for the latter date, the plaintiffs ought

reasonably to have accepted the offer of refund of the purchase price from the Vendors,

since they had by then received separate advice from both Mr Lim and P &amp; P that the

Vendors had no title to the property. Finally, in either of these cases, it was not

possible to rectify the defect, as firstly, there was no evidence that the Vendors could

have obtained a grant of letters of administration de bonis non, and secondly, after

16 September 1994, that became impossible as Syed Alsagoff had by then obtained the

grant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    On the other hand,

counsel for the plaintiffs contends that the date of assessment was correctly identified

by the learned judge as 17 July 1996. First, the court order dated 27 August 1993, which

sanctioned the sale of the property by the Vendors, remained valid and binding and equally

the conveyance was valid until it was set aside. Secondly, even if the sale and purchase

failed <i>ab initio</i>, the court can choose an alternative date of assessment, where it

is just to do so. The date of 31 January 1994 was not appropriate, as Mr Lim never

specifically advised the plaintiffs that they had received no title. The alternative date

of 12 November 1994 was also not appropriate for two reasons. First, the offer of refund

from the Vendors failed to compensate the plaintiffs for all their losses. Secondly, it

was reasonable for the plaintiffs to have pursued the course of seeking to rectify the

defect in title. Mr Dyne’s opinion suggested this, and the alternative of accepting

the failure of the sale was in the circumstances unreasonably drastic at that stage. Until

the plaintiffs were served with the summons in O S 437 of 1995, there was no evidence that

they were aware that a grant of letters of administration de bonis non had been obtained.

Consequently, it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to await the outcome of O S 437 of

1995.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.    It seems to us that

the learned judge in making the award of damages as well as counsel for both parties in

their submissions before us proceeded on the basis that damages for the loss of the

property are recoverable as a result of the defendant’s negligence. With respect, we

think that there is fundamental error implicit in such award and submissions. The question

which should be addressed first is whether such loss was caused by the negligence of the

defendant. In our opinion, the defendant’s negligence was his failure to advise the

plaintiffs that the Vendors had no title to the property, as the property was part of the

Basalamah estate and the Vendors, not having obtained the grant of letters of

administration de bonis non, were not the administrators of the estate. If the defendant

had fully discharged his professional duty to the plaintiffs, the latter would have been

advised that the Vendors had no title to the property which they purported to convey to

the plaintiffs with the consequence that the plaintiffs would have declined to complete

the purchase and would have rescinded the sale and purchase agreement, which they were

fully entitled to do. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the defendant’s

negligence caused the plaintiffs to lose the property which they would otherwise have

purchased.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.    We therefore drew

counsel’s attention to this error and have since received fresh written submissions

from them. Counsel for the defendant seems to suggest that this point has been dealt with

in his arguments before us. This we find is not so. In his arguments before us and in

particular in his written skeletal arguments, counsel referred to this point peripherally

and in a different context. In his fresh written submissions, counsel has not added

anything material to what we have said and it is not necessary to deal with his written

submissions further.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.    We now turn to the

written submissions advanced by counsel for the plaintiffs. Counsel accepts that if the

defendant had advised the plaintiffs properly, the plaintiffs would have taken steps to

rescind the contract. However, counsel contends that it does not follow that the

plaintiffs would not have purchased the property. At that time, it was open to the

plaintiffs to request Jafar to cause or procure the Vendors to approach the beneficiaries

with a view to obtaining the necessary consents or authorisations for the Vendors to apply

for the grant of letters of administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate, and if

the beneficiaries agreed, the Vendors would be in a position to regularise their title to

the property and enter into a fresh contract with the plaintiffs. Alternatively, the

plaintiffs could have asked Jafar to procure and arrange for a direct negotiation between

the plaintiffs and the beneficiaries to take place with a view to enabling the plaintiffs

to purchase the property. There was no reason why the beneficiaries would not agree to the

sale of the property to the plaintiffs at the price at which the Vendors had agreed, as

that was the prevailing market price at that time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    We find that these

arguments have no evidential basis in support. There was not a shred of evidence that the

beneficiaries to the Basalamah estate were accessible to Jafar or the Vendors or were

amenable to the Vendors taking out the letters of administration de bonis non. None of the

Vendors were entitled in their own right to apply for and take out letters of

administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate. There was no possibility at all of

the plaintiffs acquiring any title to the property from the Vendors. Nor was there any

evidence that the plaintiffs could have approached the beneficiaries and entered into

direct negotiations with them. In our opinion, these arguments are purely speculative and

are devoid of any merit whatsoever.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    There is a third

argument advanced by counsel, and that is if the beneficiaries refused to sell the

property to the plaintiffs, the latter would have immediately gone into the market to

purchase an alternative property in the Jalan Besar area. We propose to deal with this

argument shortly when we consider the alternative claim by the plaintiffs for the loss of

opportunity of buying an alternative property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.    This is not a case

where the defendant was engaged by the plaintiffs to rectify a defect in the title to the

property, and owing to his negligence he had failed to secure a good title for the

plaintiffs. In our judgment, the negligence of the defendant in relation to the sale and

purchase of the property did not cause the plaintiffs to lose the property and the

plaintiffs were not entitled to damages for the loss of the property. The dominant and

indeed the sole cause for this loss is the Vendors’ lack of title to the property

they contracted to sell to the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    We find support for

this view from the Canadian case of <i>Messineo v Beale</i> (1978) 86 DLR (3d) 713, a

decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. There, a solicitor searched the title to a

property which was being purchased by his client but failed to discover that the vendor

had no title to a significant part of what the deed purported to convey. The plaintiff

purchaser argued that the proper measure of damages was the value of the portion of the

property they had failed to obtain. This was rejected by Arnup JA who affirmed the trial

judge’s award of nominal damages. He said at p 716:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In my view it is obvious that the

  defendant’s breach of duty was not the cause of the plaintiff’s getting no title

  to Murch’s Point [the relevant portion of property]. The vendor had no title to

  Murch’s Point, and could give none. Nothing the defendant could have done would have

  changed the situation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is to be observed that if the defendant

  had discovered, before closing, that the [vendor] had no title to Murch’s Point, it

  would have been his duty to communicate the fact at once to his clients. Their options

  then would have been to refuse to close, to close and take title to what [the vendor]

  could convey, or try and negotiate once more for a lower price… </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Zuber JA, another member of the Court,

said at p 718:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The negligence of the defendant did not

  cause the plaintiffs to lose Murch’s Point. Since Finley, the vendor in the subject

  transaction never had title to Murch’s Point it was never within the grasp of the

  plaintiffs, and hence could not have been lost. The defendant’s negligence simply

  caused the plaintiffs to complete a transaction that they otherwise would have avoided.

  Therefore, it is the responsibility of the defendant to compensate the plaintiffs for the

  loss suffered as a result of entering this transaction; but as the reasons of Arnup, J.A.,

  demonstrate, there was in fact no loss.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.    Zuber JA, in a

subsequent case, <i>Kienzle v Stringer</i> (1981) 130 DLR (3d) 272 at 275, explained the

decision in <i>Messineo v Beale </i>in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In my respectful opinion, <i>Messineo v.

  Beale</i> decides only that the defendant did not cause the plaintiff any damage. Since

  the vendor did not own Murch's Point, the defendant's solicitor did not cause its loss.

  The solicitor caused the plaintiff to complete a transaction that he would otherwise have

  avoided but no loss resulted from this. The plaintiff could have resold as soon as he

  discovered that he had not obtained Murch's Point and would have suffered no loss at all.

  It would have been far different if the vendor had owned Murch's Point and the solicitor

  had omitted the property from the deed or in some other way had caused the plaintiff to

  lose the property. In that case, the plaintiff's damage would have been the value of the

  missing property despite the fact that the value of what he had received was greater than

  the purchase price.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">In that case, the defendant solicitor who

acted for the plaintiff in the purchase of a farm was negligent in failing to include all

the owners of the property in the conveyance. One year after the purchase, the plaintiff

attempted to sell the farm, and agreed to purchase another property conditional on the

sale of his farm. In anticipation of the sale, he gave up the lease of the adjoining farm.

Only then was it discovered that there was a defect in his title to the farm. As a result,

the sale fell through and the plaintiff was unable to purchase the other property. He then

had to buy out the interest of the other owner of the farm who was not joined in the

conveyance, and lost the profit for operating the farm because he had given up the lease

of the adjoining farm. At first instance, he recovered only the price he paid for

purchasing the owner’s interest and the fees paid to the defendant. He appealed and

Court of Appeal allowed his claim for the loss of the farming profit but limited it to one

year. He was, however, not allowed the profit which he would have made had he purchased

the other property. The court considered this loss as too remote.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.    Both these cases

were followed in another Canadian case, <i>Clarke v Milford</i> (1987) 38 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>)

139, which was a decision of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia. There, the property under

the will of a testator was devised to his son. After the death of the testator, the mother

on behalf of the son, who was then still an infant, sold the property to the plaintiff.

The defendant solicitor acted for both the plaintiff and the mother in the transaction,

which was apparently completed and the entire purchase price was paid. All the parties

assumed that the necessary steps were taken in completing the transaction. The client

subsequently discovered that no deed was executed by the mother and no order of court

approving the sale was obtained. No title therefore was conveyed to the client. The

property was in the meanwhile dealt with by the son who had attained the age of majority.

The client sued the solicitor for damages for negligence. Before the Court of Appeal one

of the questions raised was the damages to which the client was entitled. The court

following the decision in <i>Messineo v Beale</i> (supra) held that the solicitor could

not have done anything more than to advise the client of the inability of the mother to

convey the property, and that the client was entitled only to the actual loss he had

suffered which included the purchase price paid, the fees paid to the solicitor and the

taxes paid for the property, and that no damages were awarded for the loss of the

property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.    Reverting to the

case at hand, the plaintiffs rely on <i>Stinchcombe &amp; Cooper Ltd v Addison, Cooper,

Jesson &amp; Co</i> (1971) 115 SJ 368. We do not find this case of any assistance. There,

the solicitors were negligent in failing to inform their clients that the contract of sale

had been executed by the vendors. This caused the plaintiffs to be late in commencement of

construction, as they thought the contract had yet to be signed, and gave the vendors

ground to rescind the contract, which they did. By reason of the negligence of the

solicitor, the clients lost the contract. Damages for loss of the property were therefore

recoverable. What was decided in that case has no application here.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.    In this case, to

allow a recovery of the loss as awarded below would place the plaintiffs in a better

position than would be the case if the defendant had properly discharged his duty. The

plaintiffs are not entitled to damages for the loss of the property. The order of the

trial judge awarding such damages to be assessed before the registrar should be set aside.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Loss of opportunity</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.    We now turn to the

plaintiffs’ alternative claim for the loss of opportunity to acquire a similar

property. The basis of this claim is that if the defendant had discharged his duty, the

plaintiffs would not only have avoided the contract but would also have acquired a similar

property along Jalan Besar or a unit in Sim Lim Tower which is near to the premises where

they had been conducting their business, and this opportunity they had lost by reason of

the completion of the purchase of the property. The defendant, on the other hand, contends

that since this claim was also premised on the same negligence or breach of duty on the

part of the defendant, and all that he had failed to do was to prevent the plaintiff from

completing the purchase because the Vendors had no title to the Property, the alternative

claim must also fail.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.    We are unable to

agree with the defendant’s contention. We think that there is some merit in the

argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs. While it is true that this alternative

claim of the plaintiffs is premised on same negligence or breach of duty of the defendant

as that on which the plaintiffs’ claim of loss of the property is based, the same

consequence does not necessarily follow with respect to the plaintiffs’ loss under

this head. On the evidence adduced, there are sufficient grounds for saying that if the

plaintiffs had been properly advised they would have rescinded the contract for the

purchase of the property in October 1993 or earlier and very likely would have immediately

or soon thereafter looked for and purchased a similar property along Jalan Besar facing

Sim Lim Tower or in the alternative a unit in Sim Lim Tower for the purpose of their

business. The property (which they had then purchased) was rent controlled and they had

purchased it for their own business and not for investment. They had adequate financial

resources for the purpose, as they completed the purchase without any borrowing from a

bank or other financial institution. At or about the time of their purchase, the tenancy

of the shop unit at Sim Lim Square at which they carried on business was due to expire on

31 July 1994. Soon after the completion of the purchase, they instituted proceedings for

recovery of vacant possession of the property and also at the same time commenced

negotiations with the tenants of the property with a view to obtaining vacant possession,

which they eventually succeeded.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.    There was evidence

given by Azam Ali to the effect that if the defendant had advised the plaintiffs that the

Vendors had no title to the property, the plaintiffs would have sought to buy a similar

property along Jalan Besar facing Sim Lim Tower or alternatively a unit in Sim Lim Tower

having an area between 300 and 350 square feet. There was no evidence adduced showing

that, at or about that time, there was available in the market a similar property along

Jalan Besar. But there was evidence adduced showing the availability of units in Sim Lim

Tower fulfilling the requirements indicated by Azam Ali. In particular, there was produced

in evidence a list of sales of such units, and on the basis of this list, Azam Ali said

that if the defendant had advised the plaintiffs in or before October 1993 that the

Vendors had no title to the property they would have bought, for example, unit #03-15

having an area of 312.2 sq ft or #B1-47 having an area of 322.9 sq ft (depending of course

on their availability).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.    Given their need for

premises for their business and the approaching expiry of their existing tenancy of the

shop unit in Sim Lim Square, we find that it is very likely that the plaintiffs would in

fact have gone into the market to look for alternative premises for the purpose of their

business, if they had been advised by the defendant against the completion of the

property. On the basis of the evidence adduced, we find that they would have sought to

purchase a unit in Sim Lim Tower as an alternative. In our judgment, the plaintiffs had

indeed lost the opportunity of re-entering the market in or before October 1993 and buying

a unit in Sim Lim Tower, which would meet their requirements, and this loss was occasioned

by the defendant’s negligence or breach of duty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.    The next question is

whether this loss is too remote. In this case, as there is a concurrent liability in

contract and tort, it is necessary to bear in mind the respective tests for remoteness in

these causes of action. In the case of contractual liability, the test for recoverable

loss is that within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, based on their imputed

knowledge (in the ordinary course of things) or actual knowledge: see <i>Hadley v

Baxendale </i>(1854) 9 Ex 341<i>, The Heron II</i> [1969] 1 AC 350. As for tortious

liability, the loss is recoverable if it is reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances: <i>The

Wagon Mound</i> [1961] AC 388. However, there is authority for the view that the

difference between the two tests is semantic and not substantial, especially in situations

of concurrent liability: <i>Parsons v Uttley Ingam &amp; Co </i>[1978] QB 791 at 807; <i>Kienzle

v Stringer</i> (1981) 130 DLR (3d) 272<i> </i>at 276.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.    The crucial question

here is whether the loss falls within the defendant’s reasonable contemplation or is

reasonably foreseeable on the part of the defendant. Speaking generally, in the ordinary

course of things, a nondescript purchaser may be interested in a property because of its

potential or unique characteristics, or because it suits his personal or commercial

requirements. If the purchase becomes abortive, he may, depending on the circumstances,

immediately return to the market to purchase a similar alternative, or one that is

significantly different, or he may not even purchase a substitute at all. In such a case,

a purchaser’s claim for loss of opportunity consequent on the negligence of the kind

in question would be a claim for loss of investment opportunity. Depending on the

circumstances, such a claim may or may not be too remote.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.    Turning to the case

at hand, we should bear in mind the following. First, the plaintiffs were a commercial

concern carrying on the business of dealing in electronic goods and articles. They had

been carrying on business at the rented shop unit at Sim Lim Square which is in the

vicinity of the property in question. This must have been known to the defendant. Second,

the nature of the property. This was rent-controlled premises and it must have occurred to

the defendant that the plaintiffs were purchasing it purely for their business purposes

and not for investment. Soon after the conclusion of the contract, Azam Ali obtained the

names of the tenants of the property and this was known to the defendant. The defendant

was clearly aware that the plaintiffs would, after the completion of the purchase, proceed

to apply to the Tenant’s Compensation Board for recovery of vacant possession of the

property: see the plaintiffs’ letter to the defendant dated 14 October 1993. It is

true that there was no direct evidence that the defendant was subjectively aware of the

plaintiffs’ commercial plans and requirements in purchasing property in the Jalan

Besar area. Nevertheless, given these facts and the plaintiffs’ financial means to

buy the property without any borrowings, it was within the reasonable contemplation of the

defendant or would have been reasonably foreseen by the defendant that, if he had advised

the plaintiffs not to complete the purchase of the property on the ground that the Vendors

had no title to the Property, the plaintiffs would have rescinded the contract and

re-entered the market to purchase an alternative property which fulfilled their

requirements. In our judgment, on the facts of this case, the loss in question was not too

remote, either in contract or in tort, and is thus recoverable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.    Finally, we move to

the quantification of this loss. The characterisation of this loss is similar to the

previous head of loss which we have disallowed, the only difference being the subject

property in question. In respect of that loss, we are concerned with the loss of the

property which was purchased under the contract of sale. The measure applicable is the

difference between the value of the property at the material date and the contract price: <i>Stinchcombe

v Addison</i> (supra). In respect of this loss under consideration, we are concerned with

the hypothetical alternative shop unit in Sim Lim Tower which the plaintiffs could have

purchased had they been properly advised. According to Azam Ali, the unit which would meet

the plaintiffs’ requirements would be one having an area between 300 and 350 sq ft.

For our purpose, we would take a unit with an area of 325 sq ft. Accordingly, the

appropriate measure of this loss would be the difference between (a) the market value of a

shop a unit in Sim Lim Tower having an area of 325 sq ft at or around the date of

completion, i.e. 15 October 1993, and (b) the market value of such unit as at the date

(‘the material date’) on which they ought reasonably to have purchased this

substitute. In the court below, the plaintiffs’ arguments on this claim were run

along this line.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.    The question now is

what is the material date for the purpose of this exercise. First, we do not accept the

date of the judgment in O S 437 of 1995 as the material date. Next, the defendant

suggested the date of 31 January 1994 or in the alternative 12 November 1994. The first

was the date on which Mr Lim of SLB wrote to the defendant informing him that the Vendors

had ‘no power’ to deal with the property and that no interest in the property

had passed to the plaintiffs. We would reject this date, as Mr Lim was acting primarily

for the bank, and no copy of the letter was then given to the plaintiffs; in effect the

plaintiffs never received any definitive advice from Mr Lim on that issue. The second

date, being premised on the letter from the Vendors’ solicitors dated 12 November

1994 offering to refund to the plaintiffs ‘all monies paid without interest’,

was manifestly unacceptable. The offer would not really reimburse the plaintiffs for their

loss of the bargain and wasted expenditure. The plaintiffs could not be expected to act on

such an offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.    It seems to us that

the reasonable date should be 17 March 1995, being the date on which the plaintiffs

received Mr Dyne’s opinion on the property. By that date the plaintiffs had received:

(a) Mr Lim’s opinion that no title to the property had passed to them and the

bank’s rejection of the property as security for the loan; (b) P &amp; P’s

advice on their lack of a good title to the property; and (c) Mr Dyne’s opinion which

confirmed the earlier legal opinions that (i) no title to the property had passed to the

plaintiffs and (ii) the court order of 27 August 1993 was a nullity. It was patently clear

by that date that, in the absence of any settlement with the beneficiaries, the plaintiffs

ought to have sought alternative premises. Further, by 17 March 1995, they or their

solicitors should have also searched the probate registry and discovered that the grant de

bonis non had already been issued in favour of Alsagoff, precluding any remedy of the

title defect. Accordingly, in our judgment, the material date to assess the

plaintiffs’ loss of opportunity under this rubric was the 17 March 1995.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Recovery of the tenant compensation and

costs</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.    The question here is

whether it was reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiffs to have paid the tenants

of the property the compensations in June 1994, when prior to the dates of the payments

they had notice of a very serious defect in the title of the property. On this issue we

need to examine what precisely occurred between the time the plaintiffs completed the

purchase of the property and the time the payments were made.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.    The plaintiffs

completed the purchase on 15 October 1993, and immediately thereafter initiated an

application to the Tenants’ Compensation Board for the recovery of possession. They

instructed their solicitors, P &amp; P, to obtain an early date for the hearing, as the

tenancy of the premises they were then occupying was due to terminate on 31 July 1994. In

consequence, the hearing was fixed for 25 April 1994. In the meanwhile, Mr Lim of SLB, who

had been instructed to act for both the plaintiffs and the Bank in the proposed mortgage

of the property to secure a loan from the Bank, had made a search on the property and

found that there was a defect in the title. On 31 January 1994, he wrote to the defendant

pointing out that the Vendors had ‘no power’ to sell the property and that a

grant of letters of administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate was essential, and

that the deed of assignment of the property was ineffectual to transfer any interest in

the property to the plaintiffs. The defendant replied on 21 March 1994 setting out the

circumstances leading to the completion of the purchase of the property and concluding

that the sale had been sanctioned by the court order in O S 787 of 1993 and so long as the

order remained in effect the title was good. In response, Mr Lim wrote to the defendant

reiterating that the plaintiffs did not have a good title to the property. It does not

appear from the evidence that at or about that time Mr Lim sent copies of these letters to

the plaintiffs. Most probably, he did not. Before us counsel for the plaintiffs asserted

– and this was not challenged by counsel for the defendant – that copies of

these letters were not sent to the plaintiffs at that time. Sometime thereafter, Azam Ali

enquired with Mr Lim on the position with regard to the mortgage and the latter informed

him that there was a problem with regard to the title to the property. However, there was

no evidence to the effect that Mr Lim advised the plaintiffs specifically what the problem

was. Nor did he advise the plaintiffs to take any steps in relation to rectifying the

defect in the title or take any steps against the defendant. The reason for this is

obvious. As counsel for the plaintiffs points out, at that time, Mr Lim’s primary

duty was to act for the Bank and, if the parties had gone ahead with the mortgage, he

would represent the plaintiffs as well. It is significant that after the conversation with

Mr Lim, Azam Ali or his co-director, Chow, raised the matter with the defendant and was

assured that the title was good.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.    P &amp; P also

carried out searches on the property. On 30 June 1994, they wrote to Balan Nair stating

that the Vendors were not the administrators of the Basalamah estate and enquiring whether

they had taken any step to obtain the letters of administration de bonis non so that the

defect in the title could be rectified. Balan Nair very promptly replied on 4 July 1994

stating that they had closed the file and that they were no longer acting for the Vendors.

On 28 July 1994, P &amp; P wrote to the defendant concerning the same point. In this

instance, they set out the plaintiffs’ position more positively. They stated that the

title to the property had not passed to the plaintiffs and that the Vendors did not have

the power to sell the property to the plaintiffs, as they were not the administrators of

the Basalamah estate, and they demanded an explanation from the defendant. Here again, it

is unclear from the evidence precisely when P &amp; P carried out the searches on the

property and advised the plaintiffs on the question of their lack of title to the

property. We could only infer that they probably did the searches and advised the

plaintiffs at or near the end of June 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.    Prior to that date,

however, the plaintiffs through P &amp; P had been conducting negotiations with the

tenants of the property as regards payment of compensation. They reached agreement with

one of the tenants on or about 20 April 1994 and with the other tenant on or about 10 May

1994 as regards the amount to be paid to each of them. From the evidence adduced, it is

clear to us that these agreements were reached before they were fully advised by P &amp; P

as to the defect in their title to the property. By these agreements the plaintiffs were

committed to make the payments and they could not renege from the agreements with

impunity.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55.    The learned judge

below said at  85 of his judgment:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">85. The claim for the compensation paid to

  the tenants require greater examination. By the time the payments were made in June 1994

  the plaintiffs have already been told by Mr Lim of the defect in the title. They also had

  [P &amp; P] to act for them in the application to the Tenants Compensation Board. [P &amp;

  P] made title and probate searches and informed the vendors’ solicitors of the defect

  in the title. The plaintiffs should have sought advice on the state of their title before

  they paid the tenants. When they made payment, either they did not seek advice, or were

  not properly advised, or they disregarded the advice. In any case the defendant is not

  liable for the payment because the chain of causation was broken by the negligence of the

  plaintiffs or their advisors.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">On the basis of the facts we have

examined, this finding is plainly incorrect. It is true that the plaintiffs made the

payments in June 1994, but the commitments to make the payments were made earlier, when

they were not fully advised that they had no title to the property. On our analysis of the

facts, the chain of causation for this loss sustained by the plaintiffs had not been

broken and the defendant is liable to pay to the plaintiffs the compensations they had

paid to the tenants of the property. For the same reason, he is liable to pay the

plaintiffs the costs they had paid to their solicitors, P &amp; P, in respect of the

application to the Tenants Compensation Board.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Recovery of costs in O S 437 of 1995</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56.    The next issue is

whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendant their costs incurred in

contesting the claim instituted by Syed Alsagoff in O S 437 of 1995 as a

consequential loss occasioned by the defendant’s negligence. Central to this issue is

the question of whether the plaintiffs had acted reasonably in contesting the claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.    For this purpose,

the relevant starting point in time was the end of June 1994. By then, the

plaintiffs’ solicitors, P &amp; P, had carried out the necessary searches on the

property and must have advised them that they did not have good title to the property.

This is clearly borne out by the two letters dated 30 June and 28 July 1994 written by P

&amp; P to Balan Nair and the defendant respectively, and copies of these letters were

sent to the plaintiffs. For the next six months nothing of importance transpired. No

useful step or action appeared to have been taken by the plaintiffs to address the vital

issue of their lack of title to the property. In particular, they and those advising them

did not actively explore the possibility of the Vendors obtaining the grant of letters of

administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate. On 27 December 1994, Mr Lim

wrote to the plaintiffs informing them that the Bank would not accept the property as

security, unless the defect in their title to the property was rectified. On this

occasion, Mr Lim enclosed a copy of the letter dated 31 January 1994 which he wrote to the

defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.    After this, nothing

appeared to have been done by the plaintiffs in seeking to rectify the defect in the

title. Another two months elapsed, and only on 2 March 1995 or thereabouts, did they

instruct P &amp; P to consult Mr Dyne and obtain an opinion on the question of their title

to the property. On 17 March 1995, Mr Dyne gave a written opinion which, inter alia,

confirmed what P &amp; P had said, namely: that the plaintiffs had acquired no title to

the property as the Vendors did not have the letters of administration de bonis non to the

Basalamah estate. He specifically dealt with the question of whether a good title had

passed to the plaintiffs. He said at p 14:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A good legal title in the Property has not

  passed to the Purchaser [plaintiffs]. In fact no title has passed to the Purchaser.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, by the end of March 1995, the

plaintiffs definitely knew from three sources: Mr Lim, P &amp; P and Mr Dyne, that they

had no title to the property, and short of negotiating with the administrator, Syed

Alsagoff who had obtained the grant of letters of administration de bonis non on 16

September 1994, there was no real prospect at all of rectifying their lack of title to the

property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.    On 8 May 1995, Syed

Alsagoff commenced proceedings in O S 437 of 1995 against the Vendors and the plaintiffs

seeking an order to set aside the sale. With the opinions given by Mr Lim, P &amp; P and

Mr Dyne, it must have been clear to the plaintiffs that they had no real prospect of

success in contesting the claim of Syed Alsagoff. They must have realised that the

Vendors, not being the administrators of the Basalamah estate, had no capacity to convey

to them the property and consequently they had not obtained any title to the property. It

is true that in contesting the claim, the plaintiffs raised the defences of acquiescence

and laches, but, again, it must have been obvious to the plaintiffs and their advisers

that there was no factual basis for maintaining these defences and that there was no real

prospect of success in such defences. In our judgment, the plaintiffs were highly

unrealistic and did not act reasonably in contesting the claim of Syed Alsagoff in

O S 437 of 1995.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.    It is submitted by

counsel for the plaintiffs that they had to contest the claim, because only with a

judgment could they have persuaded the defendant to accept that the title to the property

was bad, given the respondent’s previous insistence that the title was in order. The

short answer to this is that, in such event, the plaintiffs could have apprised the

defendant of their stand that there was no defence to the claim, and if the defendant was

still insistent that the plaintiffs had a good title to the property, to offer to the

defendant that he should take over the defence in the name of the plaintiffs and indemnify

the plaintiffs against all the costs incurred.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.    We now make the

following orders in relation to these two appeals. We allow the plaintiffs’ appeal,

namely, Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, to the extent as follows. We allow the claim of the

plaintiffs for the amount of $54,500 being the total amount of the compensations paid by

them to the tenants of the property and the amount of $5,416.39 being their costs incurred

for applying to the Tenants Compensation Board. We allow the defendant’s appeal,

Civil Appeal No. 195, to this extent. We set aside the order made by learned judge for

assessment of damages and order that damages be assessed by the registrar on the basis of

what we have decided in  48-50 above.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Costs</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.    We now turn the

question of costs. The plaintiffs have succeeded partially in Civil Appeal No. 197 of

1999, and we award them 50% of the costs of this appeal. Turning to Civil Appeal No. 195

of 1999, we think that, though the defendant has succeeded in part, he has not really

succeeded on the point raised in his Case but on the point we raised and brought to

counsel’s attention. We are not disposed to award him any costs. Nor, on the other

hand, should the plaintiffs be allowed the entire costs of this appeal. We award the

plaintiffs 50% of the costs of this appeal. We so order. There will be usual orders for

(a) refund to the plaintiffs or their solicitors of the deposit in court as security costs

in Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, with interest, if any, and (b) payment to the plaintiffs

or their solicitors of the deposit in court as security for costs in Civil Appeal No. 195

of 1999, with interest, if any, to account of costs.</font></p>
