<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a summons filed by the Plaintiffs,
                    having obtained leave of the Honourable Justice Judith Prakash on
                    17 November 2009, for a committal of the first and second Defendants,
                    Ho Chin Nguang and Ng Sow Moi, for their contempt of the orders of
                    this Honourable Court dated 7 April 2009 and 31 July 2009 (the
                    “Order”), by failing to inform the Plaintiffs’ solicitors in
                    writing, within the requisite time limit or at all of:</p>

                        after the respective Orders had been served on the First and Second

                        ordinary living and legal expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The interim Mareva injunction was granted on
                    7 April 2009 against all three Defendants. It was replaced by a final
                    Mareva injunction granted on 31 July 2009 against only the first and second

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on Mareva injunctions and committal proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The relevant considerations in relation to this
                    application for committal are the first principles of Mareva injunctions and the
                    scope and purpose of the exceptions contained in such injunctions. In <em>Polly Peck International plc v Nadir</em> (<em>No 2</em>) [1992] 4 All ER 769 (“<em>Polly Peck</em> (<em>No 2</em>)”), Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR stated
                    (at 785):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So far as it lies in their power, the courts will not permit the course of
                        justice to be frustrated by a defendant taking action, the purpose of which
                        is to render nugatory or less effective any judgment or order which the
                        plaintiff may thereafter obtain. … It is not the purpose of a Mareva
                        injunction to prevent a defendant acting as he would have acted in the
                        absence of a claim against him. Whilst a defendant who is a natural person
                        can and should be enjoined from indulging in a spending spree undertaken
                        with the intention of dissipating or reducing his assets before the day of
                        judgment, he cannot be required to reduce his ordinary standard of living
                        with a view to putting by sums to satisfy a judgment which may or may not be
                        given in the future. Equally no defendant, whether a natural or juridical
                        person, can be enjoined in terms which will prevent him from carrying on his
                        business in the ordinary way or from meeting his debts or other obligations
                        as they come due prior to judgment being given in the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The relevant considerations relating to
                    committal proceedings bear restatement. J Pinsler, <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) states at para
                    52/1/2 and para 52/2/1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a general principle, the judgment creditor is expected to use
                        alternative enforcement methods before contemplating committal. Even if
                        those methods have been engaged without success, the court will not commit
                        the judgment debtor unless there is credible evidence that the
                        debtor’s non-compliance was wilful in the sense that he refused or
                        neglected to pay in spite of his ability to do so (<em>Khoo Wai Leong, Ronnie v Andrew J Hanam</em> [2003]
                        SGMC 41, para 35;) …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The other purpose of the order is to punish the offender for his contempt
                            (<em>Re Barrell Enterprises</em> [1973] 1 WLR
                        19). …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort. Other options
                        are available to the court, and often the exercise of its discretion will be
                        based on the attitude of the offender. If he is apologetic and promises to
                        comply with the court order (or if he has already complied with it since the
                        service on him of the notion of motion for committal), the court may merely
                        reprimand him in strong terms. If he has yet to comply with the order, the
                        court may warn him that unless he does so he will be imprisoned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Syarikat M Mohamed v Mahindapal Singh</em>
                        [1991] 2 MLJ 112 at 114, K C Vohrah J stated that:
                        ‘… since committal proceedings are quasi-criminal proceedings
                        and the liberty of the subject is involved, the procedural rules applicable
                        must be strictly enforced.’ The point is that the person against whom
                        the committal proceedings are brought, ‘needs to know with
                        particularity what charge or charges they are faced with, charges which can
                        land them in prison.’ The learned judge ruled that as it is the
                        specific purpose of the statement to include these grounds, any omission to
                        do so cannot be made good by setting them out in the affidavit, the purpose
                        of which is to merely verify the statement. … (See <em>Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee</em> [1993] 1 SLR
                        616.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In <em>P J Holdings Inc v
                        Ariel Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR 582 at [7], Choo Han
                    Teck J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Order 45 r 5 (1)(a) applies only when “a
                        person required by a judgment or order to do an act within a time specified
                        in the judgment or order <em>refuses or neglects</em>
                        to do it.” … In <em>Re Quintin Dick</em>
                        [1926] Ch 992, Romer J held that the term “refuse or
                        neglect” was not equivalent to “fail or omit”, and that
                        the former implied a conscious act of volition whereas the latter did not.
                        In <em>Ng Tai Tuan v Chng Gim Huat Pte Ltd</em>
                        [1990] SLR 903, Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) expressed the
                        view that the word “neglect” necessarily implies some element
                        of fault. He cited the case of <em>Re London &amp; Paris
                            Banking Corp</em> (1874) 19 Eq 444 where Jessel MR
                        said, at p 446:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… the word ‘neglected’ is not necessarily
                            equivalent to the word ‘omitted’. Negligence is a term which
                            is well known in law. Negligence in paying a debt on demand, as I
                            understand, is omitting to pay without reasonable excuse. Mere omission
                            by itself does not amount to negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The word “refuse” has also been similarly defined. In
                            <em>DP Vijandran v Majlis Peguam</em> [1995]
                        2 MLJ 391, the court noted that “[t]he ordinary meaning of the
                        word refuse is to decline to give”, and that “failure is not
                        synonymous with refusal.” Similar sentiments were also expressed by
                        the tribunal in <em>Lowson v Percy Main &amp; District Social
                            Club</em> [1979] ICR 568. I agree with the foregoing cases.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First alleged breach of this Mareva Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiffs claim in their application
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. The l<sup>st</sup> and
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants … by failing to
                        inform the Plaintiffs' solicitors in writing, within the requisite time
                        limit or at all:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(1) of the value and details of all their assets whether in or outside
                            Singapore by way of an affidavit which was to have been served on the
                            Plaintiffs' solicitors within seven (7) days after the respective
                            Orders had been served on the l<sup>st</sup> and
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants; …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The substance of the failure complained of relates to the
                    expenditure from undeclared source(s) of funds. The undeclared source(s) of
                    fund, it is claimed is evidenced by a number of events including the minimal
                    withdrawals from their disclosed bank accounts from 4 May to
                    9 September 2009, their solicitor’s requesting an increase in
                    combined limit of S$6,000 for ordinary living expenses and the subsequent
                    deposit of S$67,097 into their disclosed POSB bank account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The first Defendant admits in his affidavit that
                    between June and November 2009 he spent about S$16,115.27 to S$19,615.27 a
                    month. However, he also explained in his affidavit that he had subsequently
                    received IDR 134,819,900 by way of a monthly cash allowance from
                    PT Mega Fortune for his role as an advisor and Vice Chairman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As the Defendants’ disclosed assets are
                    insufficient to cover the Plaintiffs’ claim, the Plaintiffs counter-argued
                    that the Order extends to assets to be acquired in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Clause 2 of this Mareva injunction by its
                    own terms requires a one-off disclosure by an affidavit a list of assets and
                    this has been done. By its express terms it does not stand as a primary or a
                    continuing order to regularly update after acquired assets. In any event, the
                    subsequent receipt of monthly allowance in cash after the due submission of the
                    affidavit of assets as required by the Mareva injunction, does not by its very
                    nature constitute an undisclosed asset that was required to be disclosed by the
                    terms of this Mareva injunction, in particular Clause 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I am of the view that Clause 1(4) of this
                    Mareva injunction by its terms operates only to restrict the disposal or dealing
                    of disclosed assets. It contemplates a diminution of the disclosed assets. Even
                    if a liberal construction of this Mareva injunction were warranted, such that
                    there is construed to be a continuing obligation to update and disclose after
                    acquired assets, this monthly cash allowance does not by its nature constitute
                    an asset. I therefore find that there was no breach arising from such receipt of
                    a monthly allowance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second alleged breach of this Mareva Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Plaintiffs further claim that the first
                    and second Defendants had failed to provide the Plaintiffs’ solicitors
                    with the value and details of the assets comprising of their disclosed
                    shareholdings in a number of private companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was conceded that the Defendants had
                    provided the latest available financial statements relating to the Singapore,
                    BVI, Indonesian and Chinese private and unlisted companies in which they have an
                    interest and which were already disclosed in the affidavit of assets. The
                    Plaintiffs submit that this was not sufficient compliance as the Defendants are,
                    additionally, obliged to provide either their own estimate of the value or an
                    independent valuation of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Bearing in mind that the shares are of private
                    companies in multiple jurisdictions, no additional commercial purpose can be
                    served by requiring the Defendants to provide their estimate of the value when
                    the Plaintiffs have been given the relevant financial statements and were able
                    to arrive at their own conclusion as to the valuation of those assets. To
                    require the Defendants to take the further step of procuring independent
                    valuations of unlisted companies would be unduly onerous considering the
                    interlocutory nature and the purpose of granting a Mareva injunction. I
                    accordingly find no breach as claimed by the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Third alleged breach of this Mareva Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Plaintiffs’ application further
                    claims that the Defendants have failed to inform the Plaintiffs’
                    solicitors in writing, within the requisite time limit or at all of the source
                    of the money used before spending the same in the amount specifically limited by
                    this Honourable Court for their expenditure on ordinary living and legal
                    expenses <em>to wit</em> that they have breached the
                    spending limits by reason of their admitted monthly expenditure of S$16,115.27
                    to S$19,615.27.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the first Defendant had already explained
                    in his affidavit, these amounts were monthly cash allowances received
                    subsequently to the filing of his affidavit of assets due to his role as advisor
                    and Vice Chairman of PY Mega Fortune. Given that his interest in PY Mega
                    Fortune has been duly disclosed in his affidavit of assets, and also he has not
                    drawn on or dissipated the bank accounts and assets disclosed in his affidavit
                    of assets, it would be a stretch to conclude that he is to be subject to
                    committal proceedings by virtue of receiving subsequent advances or gifts which,
                    I have already determined, do not constitute assets for the purposes of this
                    Mareva injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As I do not find there to have been a
                    contumelious breach of the Orders in the circumstances, the application is
                    denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     No order as to costs.</p>
