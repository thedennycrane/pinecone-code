As I will mention below (at [118]), I do not deal with this sum due from Feima to Kyen as this would not affect the amount claimed by Feima in its Proof of Debt. I should note that the sum of USD 32,079,540.97 is a different figure from what was quoted in the plaintiff’s letter dated 6 October 2022 (which was USD 32,537,845.48). This is despite the fact that the same figures were being added up from [2(a)]–[2(c)], excluding the sum of HDK 12,957.94, which would not be significant relative to the remaining sum. It appears to me that the plaintiff has added the figures wrongly in its above-mentioned letter.

More specifically, if I am of the view that the Kyen Liquidators should have pursued legal proceedings against Feima in respect of these counterclaims, then it will not be appropriate for me to express any view on the merits of these claims. As we shall see below, I did in fact conclude that the Kyen Liquidators are<span class="font-italic"> not</span> justified in accounting for the counterclaims in the adjudication of the Proof of Debt as there were complex issues involved which cannot be easily resolved by simple arithmetic.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The general approach in relation to an application under rule 93</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>The general approach in relation to the present application is not really in dispute.

The duty to pay the company’s debts resides with the liquidator, who may exercise powers given to a liquidator in a winding up by the court as provided under s 305 Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). In a winding up, a creditor bears the burden of proving the debt on a balance of probabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Westpac Banking Corporation v </span><span class="font-italic">Totterdell</span> [1997] 142 FLR 137 and <span class="font-italic">The Trustee in Bankruptcy of Lo Siu Fai Louis v Toohey</span> [2005] 4 HKC 51). The liquidator must assess every proof of debt lodged and may call for further evidence in support of the claim. In considering a proof, the liquidator is not bound by the audited accounts or audit confirmations entered into by the company, and is entitled to go behind them to determine the veracity of the debt claimed …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 With this general approach in mind, I turn to consider the validity of the Kyen Liquidators’ grounds for rejecting the Proof of Debt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Kyen Liquidators’ “primary ground” for rejection should be affirmed</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In relation to the Kyen Liquidators’ “primary ground” for rejection of the Proof of Debt founded on the counterclaims of dishonest assistance and knowing receipt, the threshold issue is whether the Kyen Liquidators are justified in accounting for the counterclaims in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt in the adjudication of Feima’s proof, rather than by way of formal legal proceedings. For convenience, I shall term this as the “Threshold Issue”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my view, the Kyen Liquidators’ “primary ground” for rejecting the Proof of Debt turns on this very point. For reasons that I will develop, I do not think that the Kyen Liquidators are entitled in accounting for the counterclaims in the adjudication of Feima’s proof. In my view, in the light of the substantive disputes of facts, the Kyen Liquidators should have properly commenced legal proceedings against Feima. As such, because of the conclusion I have reached, I will not address the parties’ arguments on the merits of the counterclaims, especially if the Kyen Liquidators do decide to pursue both counterclaims by way of legal proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Kyen Liquidators are justified in accounting for the counterclaims in adjudication of the Proof of Debt</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ original submissions on the Threshold Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I begin by canvassing the parties’ original submissions on the Threshold Issue. In their original submissions, the defendants attempted to justify the Kyen Liquidators’ decision to account for the counterclaims by rejecting the Proof of Debt. The defendants say that, in the exercise of their quasi-judicial function, the Kyen Liquidators are obliged to admit only “true liabilities” of Kyen. More specifically, the defendants submit that a liquidator is entitled to reject a liability which, though enforceable against the company, is not a “true liability of the company”. In support of this proposition, they cite the High Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">Tanning Research Laboratories v O’Brien </span>[1990] 91 ALR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Tanning</span>”), where Brennan and Dawson JJ held (at 184):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principles which determine enforceability of the liability to which a proof of debt relates are, in the main, the same as the principles which would be applied in an action brought directly against the company to enforce that liability. Those principles include the law relating to the barring of actions by time: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Motor Terms Co. Pty. Ltd. v. Liberty Insurance Ltd.</span> (1967) 116 CLR 177. But this general rule is qualified. As the parties whose interests are affected by admission of a proof of debt are the general body of creditors and the contributories rather than the company in liquidation, there are some liabilities which would be enforceable against the company but which a liquidator is not bound to admit to proof of debt lest the interests of creditors and contributories may be unjustly affected. <span class="font-italic">A liquidator may properly reject a proof of debt if the liability, though enforceable against the company, is not a true liability of the company but is founded merely on some act or omission on the part of the company which unjustly prejudices the interests of the creditors or contributories in the assets available for distribution</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span>In this respect, there is no reason to distinguish between the position of a liquidator and that of a trustee in bankruptcy: see <span class="font-italic">Ayerst v. C</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; K. (Construction) Ltd. </span>(1976) AC 167.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 According to the defendants, Brennan and Dawson JJ explained that a claim is not a “true liability of the company” if there are (at 185):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Circumstances tending to show fraud or collusion or miscarriage of justice or that a compromise was not a fair and reasonable one, in the sense that even if not fraudulent it was foolish, absurd and improper, or resulted from an unequal position of the parties</span> (see <span class="font-italic">In re Hawkins; Ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Troup</span> ((1895) 1 QB 404, at p 409)) offer occasions for the exercise by the Court of Bankruptcy of its power to inquire into the consideration for the judgment.” It is not necessary in this case to determine the scope of this qualification. It suffices to note that <span class="font-italic">it qualifies the principles governing the admission or rejection of a proof of debt by arming the liquidator with grounds for rejecting a proof of debt additional to any grounds available under the general law</span>. For present purposes, the relevant consideration is that no liability which is unenforceable against the company by the general law can found a debt admissible to proof in a winding up.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I should note that the defendants have not accurately quoted this passage. This is because the first sentence in quotation is actually <span class="font-italic">not</span> from <span class="font-italic">Tanning</span> but from the earlier case of the High Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">Wren v Mahony </span>(1972) 126 CLR 212 (“<span class="font-italic">Wren</span>”) at 223. In <span class="font-italic">Wren</span>, Barwick CJ had explained the grounds on which a court of bankruptcy will inquire into the validity of a judgment debt in the adjudication of a bankruptcy application, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to “go behind” any judgment on which the creditor relies on to ascertain whether the judgment was founded on a real debt. Had the defendants referred to this underlying case, it might have been clear that these passages in <span class="font-italic">Tanning </span>are not relevant in the present application, which is not concerned with whether I should question the validity of an existing judgment debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Be that as it may, the defendants advance two justifications why the Kyen Liquidators are entitled to account for the counterclaims by rejecting the Proof of Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 First, the defendants emphasise that the Kyen Liquidators are entitled to account for the counterclaims as they are exercising their <span class="font-italic">quasi-judicial</span> function to determine the “true liabilities” of Kyen.

</div> In my view, this does not take the defendants very far. This amounts to nothing more than an assertion that the defendants are entitled to so account without providing any reason why, apart from the fact that they are the liquidators of Kyen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Further, if the Kyen Liquidators are suggesting that I should give deference to their decision because it was made in a quasi-judicial capacity, then that is a proposition I cannot accept. Indeed, it would not be legally accurate to assert that the role of the liquidator<span class="font-italic"> remains</span> that of a quasi-judicial function, even on an <span class="font-italic">appeal</span> of the liquidator’s own decision. In this regard, I refer to the relevant portion of a seminal Australian textbook which elaborates on this point (see Michael Murray and Jason Harris, <span class="font-italic">Keay’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Insolvency: Personal and Corporate Law and Practice</span> (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2018) at pp 602–603):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Appeal against liquidator’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a creditor’s proof of debt is rejected by the liquidator the creditor may appeal by seeking court orders under IPSCA s 90-15 and, other than in exceptional circumstances, should not institute legal proceedings against the company. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On any appeal hearing, the courts apply the same rules to liquidators who are examining proofs of debt as those applied to trustees of bankrupt estates. In such a proceeding, a <span class="font-italic">liquidator who defends</span> their decision to reject a proof of debt <span class="font-italic">is no longer acting in a quasi-judicial capacity</span>, rather the liquidator takes the role of an<span class="font-italic"> adversary in the litigation</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The key takeaway is that there should no longer be any emphasis placed on the <span class="font-italic">quasi-judicial </span>function of the liquidator once an appeal has been brought. This is because the liquidator no longer acts in that capacity when defending his own decision, and instead, he will take on “the role of an adversary in the litigation”. On an appeal, the views formed by the liquidator when he was acting quasi-judicially<span class="font-italic"> </span>is not legally enforceable and no deference has to be given (see Andrew R Keay, <span class="font-italic">McPherson &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Keay’s Law of Company Liquidation</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2021) at para 12-067, citing the Australian decision of <span class="font-italic">Tanning</span>). Given this shift in perspective on an appeal, even if the liquidator was of the view that it was entitled to adjudge and conclude the company’s <span class="font-italic">own </span>claim or counterclaim against the creditor’s proof of debt, that can always be overridden by the supervising court as those views are non-binding. Thus, the repeated emphasis of the liquidator’s quasi-judicial role does not assist the defendants’ arguments. There is no special threshold to overcome when the court overrides the decision of the liquidator, even if the liquidator can be described as exercising a quasi-judicial function (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">MWA</span><span class="font-italic"> Capital Pte Ltd v Ivy Lee Realty Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2017] SGHC 216 at [44]–[45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, the defendants say that Kyen’s counterclaims clearly arise from “[c]ircumstances tending to show fraud or collusion or miscarriage of justice”.

</div>
</div> This is because, according to the defendants, the evidence shows that Feima had dishonestly assisted Kyen’s directors in procuring the Third Party Transactions, and that Feima was in knowing receipt of monies traceable to the DCL Copper Payments. Further, the defendants say that Feima’s involvement in the Third Party Transactions was suspicious because it also entered into a transactions with Kyen and IFL where the same amount of nickel cathodes were sold by Kyen to various entities and then sold back to Kyen. In other words, no commercial transaction took place. Finally, the defendants say that their concerns about these Third Party Transactions were not adequately addressed by Feima’s Liquidators. Accordingly, it is in Kyen’s and its creditors’ interests that the Kyen Liquidators account for these counterclaims in the adjudication of the Proof of Debt, rather than by any formal legal proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, the defendants’ second justification likewise does not take them very far. In the first place, <span class="font-italic">Tanning </span>does not assist them as the cited passage from Brennan JJ and Dawson JJ does not relate at all to whether and how the Kyen Liquidators are entitled to rely on the counterclaims founded on dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. The defendants’ argument that the liquidator’s duty to admit only “true liabilities” of the company therefore does not assist them in the situation when the Kyen Liquidators are adjudicating on Kyen’s own counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Furthermore, even if I were to accept that <span class="font-italic">Tanning </span>is relevant, then, as Feima points out, where the liquidator seeks to set-off a creditor’s debt by way of a counterclaim, the burden is on the liquidator to prove on a balance of probabilities its counterclaim (including the quantum of the counterclaim) (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Castleplex</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd (in liq), Re; Labaj v Hambleton </span>[2010] QCA 59 (“<span class="font-italic">Labaj</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29] and <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> JPF Clarke (Construction) Ltd (in a company voluntary arrangement) Maze Inns Ltd and others v Hunt and others </span>[2019] Lexis Citation 379 at [70]–[73], [110], [128]). Thus, the defendants cannot attempt to circumvent their burden of proving dishonest assistance and knowing receipt by saying that their claims of dishonest assistance and knowing receipt are “[c]ircumstances tending to show fraud or collusion or miscarriage of justice” and that the Kyen Liquidators are therefore justified in simply accounting for these counterclaims against the Proof of Debt, without commencing legal proceedings. This, in my view, cannot be the case.

</div> In that case, Sembawang Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd (“Sembawang”) commenced suit against Metax Eco Solutions Pte Ltd (“Metax”). Before judgment was given in the suit, Sembawang went into insolvent liquidation.

</div> First, the defendants have never raised a <span class="font-italic">set-off</span> but have only tried to argue for <span class="font-italic">cross-claims</span> for dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. Second, Insolvency Set-off does not apply to claims arising from the Third Party Transactions. This is because, on the defendants’ characterisation, those transactions are payments of cash out of Kyen for no consideration and would constitute a misappropriation of company assets that do not constitute a “mutual dealing” within the meaning of s 88(1) of the BA. Third, Insolvency Set-off does not apply to claims which give rise to insolvency clawback. Again, if the Third Party Transactions are payments of cash out of Kyen with no consideration, they would constitute undervalue transactions and/or unfair preferences, for which no insolvency set-off should be available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Feima further submitted that it is incumbent on the Kyen Liquidators to show that they had tried to pursue the counterclaims.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in adjudication, the liquidator’s duty is to admit only “true liabilities of the company” and to “ensure that assets of the insolvent company are distributed amongst those who are justly, legally and properly creditors”. Pursuant to this duty, the Kyen Liquidators are entitled to go behind a judgment or estoppel “in circumstances tending to show fraud or collusion” (citing <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA </span>at [13]–[14]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Kyen Liquidator’s power to go behind a judgment or estoppel in these circumstances is analogous to asserting Kyen’s cross-claim(s) in respect of the putative creditor’s fraud or collusion.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Kyen’s cross-claims arise from circumstances tending to show fraud or collusion or miscarriage of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Furthermore, the defendants submit that the Kyen Liquidators are not going beyond their role in adjudicating the Proof of Debt by accounting for its cross-claims. The defendants submit that the Kyen Liquidators’ quasi-judicial role includes the discretion to account for Kyen’s claims in adjudication, including by way of set-off. In this regard, the defendants cite the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> National Wholemeal Bread and Biscuit Co </span>[1892] 2 Ch 457 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> National Wholemeal Bread</span>”), in which the creditor submitted that the liquidator did not have the power to assert the company’s own claim by way of set-off, but Vaughan Williams J rejected this argument and held that the liquidator can consider any set-off asserted (at 460). Accordingly, the defendants submit that the Kyen Liquidators must be in a position to assert, during their adjudication of the proofs, Kyen’s counterclaims.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Indeed, Mr David Chan (“Mr Chan”), who appeared on behalf of the defendants, further submitted before me that since <span class="font-italic">Tanning </span>allowed the liquidators to go behind a judgment debt on the basis of fraud and collusion, that must surely mean that the Kyen Liquidations are equally justified in determining that there was either dishonest assistance, knowing receipt, or both, and assert this by way of a counterclaim against Feima. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 More broadly, the defendants suggest that a strict requirement that a liquidator must prosecute a counterclaim by way of formal legal proceedings is artificial and not supported by the authorities. Indeed, they say that this cannot be in the best interests of the general body of creditors of an insolvent company, as in the present case. Further, they argue that <span class="font-italic">Labaj</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>does not impose a requirement that the Kyen Liquidators must have tried to pursue the counterclaims in order to account for the same in adjudication. For convenience, I set out the relevant paragraph of <span class="font-italic">Labaj</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [29]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Some reference was made to the pleadings in the District Court action referred to above. In its defence in that action, the company had claimed a set off. That set off was based on the same facts as were relied upon to support a counterclaim. The liquidators have made no attempt to pursue the counterclaim and there was no evidence at first instance in the present proceedings to support it. The onus of proving a set off is on the party alleging it. Those allegations therefore cannot assist the liquidators in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, the defendants argue that the circumstances of the present case point towards the Kyen Liquidators rightly deciding not to pursue legal proceedings against Feima. First of all, Feima was already in compulsory liquidation when the Proof of Debt was filed. The Kyen Liquidators therefore decided that it was not commercially viable to commence proceedings against Feima given the prohibitive costs involved and the dim prospects of recovery. Second, given the wholesale denial by Feima Liquidators of Kyen’s counterclaim in this case, it is apparent that any legal proceedings between the parties would have been complex and costly. As such, the defendants say that it is in the best interests of Kyen’s general body of creditors not to formally prosecute the counterclaims (and presumably, assert the counterclaims by way of accounting for the counterclaims in the adjudication of the Proof of Debt). Moreover, in light of Feima Liquidators’ wholesale denial of Kyen’s counterclaims, filing a proof of debt in Feima’s liquidation for the same counterclaims would be an exercise in futility. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision: the Kyen Liquidators are not entitled to account for the counterclaims in their adjudication of the Proof of Debt</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The relevant issues </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I am of the view that the parties’ additional submissions raise the following relevant issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether the Kyen Liquidators’ quasi-judicial role entitle them to account for the counterclaims in adjudication.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and relatedly, whether the Cross-claim Rule applies in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, whether Insolvency Set-off applies in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether the Kyen Liquidators’ quasi-judicial role entitle them to account for the counterclaims in adjudication </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I turn then to the first issue. It is trite law that when the liquidator ascertains and discharges the liabilities of the insolvent company, he or she acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA </span>examined the duties of a liquidator in assessing a proof of debt extensively. Most pertinently, the court held (at [13]) that “[t]he liquidator must assess every proof of debt lodged and may call for further evidence in support of the claim”. And in doing so, as Etherton J explained in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Menastar Finance Ltd (in liq), Menastar Ltd v Simon </span>[2003] BCLC 338 at [44] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[t]he power of a liquidator is, in this respect no different from that of the court itself, since the liquidator, in deciding whether to accept or reject a creditor’s proof in whole or in part, is acting in a quasi judicial capacity… His statutory duty is to ensure that the company’s property is collected in and applied in satisfaction of its liabilities <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>among its proper creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Likewise, as Lai Kew Chai J put it in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">ERPIMA</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Chee Yoh Chuang and another </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 923 (“<span class="font-italic">ERPIMA</span><span class="font-italic"> SA</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4], the liquidator’s quasi-judicial role is “as if he is sitting in judgment like a judicial officer. As his role is quasi-judicial, he cannot act unjudicially, capriciously or arbitrarily”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The rationale for the liquidator’s quasi-judicial role is founded on the efficiency of the liquidation process. Necessarily, if the liquidator was made to resolve every point of dispute in court, this may not be economical and proportionate considering the costs and time involved – especially for an already insolvent company. The liquidator’s quasi-judicial role can thus be said to entitle them to oversee simple disputes of facts in order to ensure a practical and efficient conclusion of the liquidation process. However, this is always subject to the court’s overarching supervision to oversee the process and reject what the liquidator has done if it was inappropriate. For example, albeit in a different context, under s 218(4) of the IRDA, the liquidator has the wide discretion to decide on the estimated value of a debt which “does not bear a certain value” (by reason of it being subject to any contingency or for other reasons), but s 218(5) then goes on to provide that any person aggrieved by the estimate made by the liquidator may then appeal this value to the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Having regard to the above elucidation of the quasi-judicial role, I disagree with the defendants’ argument that the Kyen Liquidators’ quasi-judicial role entitles them to account for the counterclaims in the adjudication of the Proof of Debt where there are <span class="font-italic">complex</span> disputes of facts involved (such as those involving dishonest assistance and knowing receipt). In my judgment, the defendants’ argument is wrong for the following reasons founded on precedent, principle, and policy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Precedent</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, in terms of precedent, there is nothing in the case law that entitles a liquidator to account for the company’s counterclaim against a creditor in the adjudication of a proof of debt where there are <span class="font-italic">complex</span> disputes of facts involved (as opposed to simple ones involving mutual debts which automatically cancel each other out as a matter of arithmetic). Whilst it is true that the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> National Wholemeal Bread</span> suggests that a liquidator can consider counterclaims or cross-claims to be set-off and accounted for, these are <span class="font-italic">only</span> in relation to relatively simple cases where there was little dispute as to the existence and amount of the counterclaims and cross-claims involved. I refer to the relevant portion of the holding in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> National Wholemeal Bread</span> which elaborates on this principle (at 460):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am against you on the question of fraudulent preference being a matter of set-off. The position of the liquidator is very like that of a trustee in bankruptcy. He <span class="font-italic">may allow anything as a set-off which is a matter of account</span>; but he <span class="font-italic">must not avoid or rescind an agreement</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I hold that for the purposes of today the set-off is admissible upon the examination of the proof by the liquidator <span class="font-italic">for the purposes of the account which he has to take in order to arrive at the amount, </span>if any, for which the proof is to be admitted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Importantly, Vaughan Williams J opined that a liquidator “may allow anything as a set-off which is a matter of account” and that the set-off was permitted “for the purposes of the account which he has to take in order to arrive at the amount”. These phrases suggest that the court was identifying the net balance of the claims due by taking <span class="font-italic">an account</span> of what was owing from each party in respect of the mutual debts or dealings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was a matter of simple arithmetic. Indeed, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> National Wholemeal Bread</span> involved the relatively straightforward issue of whether an employee of the company in liquidation was overpaid his salary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There is also the English case of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 6); Mahfouz v Morris and others</span> [1994] 1 BCLC 450 (“<span class="font-italic">BCCI</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 6)</span>”), where the issue arose as to whether cross-examination and discovery should be ordered in the hearing of appeal against the liquidator’s rejection of the proof of debt. The liquidators had rejected the proof on the ground that the company had claims for fraudulent and wrongful trading and misfeasance against the individual creditor, which the liquidators regarded they were entitled to set-off and account against the amounts due. In determining the issue of whether cross-examination was required, the court held that cross-examination would be ordered where it was “necessary for fairly disposing of the particular issue”. Whether it was necessary depended on the circumstances of the particular case (at 453). For example, where there was “no documentary evidence of any description [that] has been put forward to support” a bare assertion (at 454), then cross-examination would be required. This suggests that liquidators cannot simply account for a counterclaim without a more detailed examination of the underlying facts, especially in a case which involved complex facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Looking to the local jurisprudence, we have the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">ERPIMA</span><span class="font-italic"> SA</span> where the plaintiff company had sought orders from the court to reverse the defendant judicial managers’ decision to reject their proof of debt. In the end, due to conflicting affidavit evidence, the court concluded that the resolution of the issues in dispute (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the company could set-off and counterclaim) required trial in the usual way (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">In the light of the conflicting affidavit evidence</span>, which in some issues certainly were not backed up by documentary evidence, <span class="font-italic">the conclusion was irresistible that the resolution of the issues required the trials in the usual way of both suits instituted by the plaintiffs</span>. Evidence by affidavits were inappropriate to resolve the issues. … This would require an investigation of the “factual matrix” leading to the agreement. <span class="font-italic">The third question was whether the company could set off and counterclaim, </span>even if there was liability under the agreement,<span class="font-italic"> for the sums mentioned earlier in this judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Thus, the court dismissed the application but ordered that the outcome of the proof of debt should abide by the final determination of the two suits in which all issues in controversy amongst the parties can be dealt with comprehensively (at [2] and [26]). What can be gleaned is that the court recognised that if there are contentious counterclaims which involve untangling a complex web of issues arising from various dealings between the parties, then those disputes will first need to be resolved by trial before the arithmetic resumes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Principle</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Pulling together the threads from the various authorities, it appears to me that these are the applicable principles:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, while a liquidator is entitled to account from the proof of debt any counterclaim/cross-claim, this can only be allowed where the factual matrix is <span class="font-italic">not complex</span> such that it remains a matter of simple arithmetic, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is a straightforward matter of identifying the net balance of claims.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, if there are substantial disputes as to the existence and amounts of the counterclaim/cross-claim which do require a <span class="font-italic">complex</span> web of facts and issues to be untangled, then these must usually be resolved by way of a full trial (or other mode of trial necessary for fairly disposing of the issues) <span class="font-italic">before </span>the arithmetic can resume.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Nevertheless, a liquidator can take the risk and make his own assessment that the accounting exercise did not require a trial. This would then put the burden on the creditor to make an appeal to court to correct any errors, and the court may then subsequently find that a trial or limited cross-examination was necessary to resolve the issues. This would be consonant with the policy rationale underlying the efficient proof of debt process (see <span class="font-italic">ERPIMA</span><span class="font-italic"> SA</span> at [5], albeit in the context of judicial managers):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The entire process of proof, admission or rejection is ordinarily completed before the judicial manager puts up his proposals on the best way to deal with the company under judicial management. It is therefore quite fast and certainly not as formal as a court trial. He does not have to deliver a reasoned judgment. One exception is where a proof of debt involves controversial disputes of facts, where the company under the judicial management on the facts known has to oppose the admission of a claim and where interpretation of agreements is involved. A judicial manager in those cases is not expected to adjudicate upon the matter. He is perfectly entitled to reject the proof of debt and the creditor is not without remedy. Such a creditor may appeal under reg 80.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, I would caveat that in so doing, the fact that the liquidator had made no attempt to pursue the counterclaim would likely mean that a court is less likely to conclude that the liquidator’s decision to account from the proof of debt any counterclaim was correct. This is especially if what the liquidator had were mere allegations and the evidence was lacking (see <span class="font-italic">Labaj</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]) unless some proper explanation can be given as to why the counterclaims were not pursued further by way of initiating proceedings or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Further, it would often be the case that where the allegations made against a creditor are rather grave in nature (such as those of misfeasance and fraud), then the allegation must ordinarily be tested by cross-examination (see <span class="font-italic">BCCI</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 6)</span> at 454). In the present case, one of the bases of the Kyen Liquidators’ counterclaims in the adjudication of the Proof of Debt encompasses that of dishonest assistance. In order to prove dishonest assistance, one must necessarily satisfy the court (amongst other elements of the test) that the assistance given was indeed <span class="font-italic">dishonest</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the party has “such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them” (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 (“<span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage</span>”) at [22]). Such claims necessarily require the process of trial to uncover the truth of the matter and whether the standards of honest conduct were breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 More broadly, the defendants’ argument fundamentally misunderstands the judicial function. In the first place, as Lai J had so eloquently put it in <span class="font-italic">ERIPIMA</span><span class="font-italic"> SA </span>(at [4]), “[a]s [the liquidator’s] role is quasi-judicial, he cannot act unjudicially, capriciously or arbitrarily”. A moment’s reflection will reveal that a judge cannot act in his or her own cause. In my view, it would certainly be “unjudicial” for a liquidator of an insolvent company to assert a counterclaim based on <span class="font-italic">her </span>own assessment of the facts in <span class="font-italic">her </span>adjudication of a creditor’s proof of debt. In saying this, I accept that the liquidator is not representing the insolvent company and stands as an objective (and independent) officer of the court to see to the proper end of the company. I also accept that the adjudication of the proof of debt process necessarily entails the liquidator acting in the insolvent company’s interest <span class="font-italic">to</span><span class="font-italic"> some extent</span> – because, in adjudicating a creditor’s proof of debt, she is necessarily making an adjudication not from a position of pure neutrality but from the perspective of the insolvent company’s creditors’ best interests. But I think it crosses the line for a liquidator to essentially advance, adjudge, and summarily conclude the company’s <span class="font-italic">own </span>claim or counterclaim where it involved complex and highly-fact dependent issues (which likely required a trial to be resolved), against the creditor’s proof of debt, save for a formal appeal to the court under the Rules. This, in my view, cannot be the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Indeed, the defendants’ argument misunderstands the distinction between adjudicating on a claim <span class="font-italic">by </span>the creditor and a claim <span class="font-italic">against </span>the creditor. This distinction is so trite that Coomaraswamy J<span class="font-italic"> </span>cited no authority in <span class="font-italic">Lim Siew Soo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>when he concluded that (at [11]) “[t]he adjudication procedure operates only to resolve claims <span class="font-italic">against </span>the Company. It has no application to claims <span class="font-italic">by </span>the Company” [emphasis in original]. Thus, when the cases refer to the liquidator being duty-bound to admit only the “true liabilities” of the company, that is in relation to claims <span class="font-italic">against </span>the insolvent company, not claims <span class="font-italic">by </span>the company. This is clear from a plain reading of a passage that the defendants rely on repeatedly (see <span class="font-italic">Tanning </span>at 184):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A liquidator may properly reject a proof of debt if the liability, though enforceable <span class="font-italic">against</span> the company, is not a true liability of the company but is found merely on some act or omission on the part of the company which unjustly prejudices the interests of the creditors or contributories in the assets available for distribution… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage clearly refers to claims against the insolvent company and has nothing to do with claims asserted <span class="font-italic">by </span>the insolvent company itself. Perhaps an appropriate analogy may be found in the use of promissory estoppel (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Combe v Combe</span> [1951] 2 KB 215), whereas the adjudication procedure can be used as a <span class="font-italic">shield </span>in relation to claims against the insolvent company, it cannot be used as a <span class="font-italic">sword </span>against creditors in asserting the insolvent company’s own counterclaims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Policy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Finally, my conclusion that the Kyen Liquidators are not entitled to account for the counterclaims (where a complex factual matrix is involved) does not detract from the policy reason behind the adjudication procedure, which is to ensure efficiency in the liquidation process. The quest for efficiency in the liquidation process cannot be pursued at all costs. While the <span class="font-italic">overall</span> interests of the insolvent company’s creditors are important, that cannot be allowed to trump the <span class="font-italic">individual </span>interest of a creditor who may be aggrieved by the adjudication of an unadjudicated (by way of legal proceedings) counterclaim against it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Application to the present case</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the present case, Kyen’s counterclaims in knowing receipt and dishonest assistance are necessarily issues which are highly-fact dependant and may require a full trial to decide. There are thorny issues which have to be resolved before one can proceed further: (a) in respect of dishonest assistance, whether the assistance was indeed <span class="font-italic">dishonest </span>(as I have canvassed above at [58]), and (b) with respect to knowing receipt, whether there was knowledge on the part of the recipient that the assets received are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty, and in this regard, the recipient’s state of knowledge had to be such as to make it <span class="font-italic">u</span><span class="font-italic">nconscionable</span> for the recipient to retain the benefit of the receipt (see <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage</span> at [23]). These issues (as opposed to a simple restitution claim) may be so complex that it might mandate that those disputes to be resolved first by formal legal proceedings before the arithmetic resumes by setting off. Accordingly, for reasons founded on precedent, principle, and policy, I do not find that this was a case that was so simple that the Kyen Liquidators’ quasi-judicial role entitled them to account for the counterclaims in adjudication without resolving the disputed facts and issues by way of trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 More specifically, I agree with Mr Alexander Yeo (“Mr Yeo”), who appeared for Feima, that the Kyen Liquidators’ rejection of the Proof of Debt based on these alleged counterclaims was really founded on a list of questions that the Kyen Liquidators had tendered to Feima.

</div>
</div> Essentially, the matter was left hanging in the air and no proper conclusion was reached. Given this ambiguous state of affairs, the Kyen Liquidators cannot then go on to draw the inference that there was absolutely <span class="font-italic">no basis </span>for the DCL Payments to be made, such that Kyen could found a claim against Feima in dishonest assistance or knowing receipt arising from this allegedly suspicious third party transaction. All that the Kyen Liquidators have from the list of questions is their own suspicions, but they must go further to crystalise this counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my view, given the lack of evidence and complexity of the issues involved, the appropriate course of action would have been to bring these issues to trial to fairly investigate them before the Kyen Liquidators are entitled to account for the counterclaims. It cannot be that two potentially complex counterclaims (dishonest assistance and knowing receipt) can be made out on the basis of a series of questions. I simply do not have sufficient material before me to confidently decide either way on these issues as these matters would require a fuller investigation. In any event, as I have alluded to above at [20], I say no more about the merits of the dishonest assistance and knowing receipt counterclaims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether the Insolvency Set-off applies in the present case</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I turn now to the point highlighted by Feima (see above at [39]) concerning whether the defendants were entitled in certain circumstances to raise the defence of Insolvency Set-off. In my judgment, Insolvency Set-off cannot be invoked in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, the defendants have never run their case on the basis that there was a set-off. Indeed, as Feima points out, the defendants have repeatedly stated that they can raise <span class="font-italic">counterclaims</span> for dishonest and/or knowing receipt. Indeed, this is the basis for the Kyen Liquidators’ rejection of the Proof of Debt. They cannot be allowed to recharacterise that reason as a set-off at this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Second, Insolvency Set-off under s 88(1) of the BA (read with s 327(2) of the CA) does not apply to claims arising from the Third Party Transactions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the large and suspicious transactions made to third parties). The main thrust of the defendants’ complaint is that these transactions were wrongfully made as Kyen had paid out cash to these third parties but for no consideration at all. But if that was the case being run, then this would constitute a <span class="font-italic">misappropriation</span> of company assets which would not satisfy the requirement that there be a “mutual dealing” within meaning of s 88(1) of the BA (see above at [39] for the provision). I develop this point further below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The law on Insolvency Set-off is well-established: (a) it is <span class="font-italic">mandatory </span>and parties are not permitted contractually to exclude its effect, and (b) it is an automatic <span class="font-italic">self-executing</span> procedural directive which takes effect without the need for further intervention and arises by operation of law (irrespective of the parties’ wishes) (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">CIMB</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank Bhd v Italmatic Tyre &amp; Retreading Equipment (Asia) Pte Ltd</span> [2021] 4 SLR 883 at [134]). Mutuality is important to the operation of Insolvency Set-off, and this is evident from the text of s 88(1) of the BA: “[w]here there have been any mutual credits, mutual debts or other <span class="font-italic">mutual dealings</span> …” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In relation to the requirement of <span class="font-italic">mutual dealings</span>, it is also well-settled that liability arising from misfeasance proceedings, such as those involving a misappropriation of funds belonging to an insolvent company or conversion of the company’s property, is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a claim arising from <span class="font-italic">mutual dealings</span> and Insolvency Set-off would not be applicable. The simple explanation is that the misfeasance cannot constitute a “dealing” for the purposes of set-off (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Manson v Smith (liquidator of Thomas Christy Ltd)</span> [1997] 2 BCLC 161 at 164):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, r 4.90 and its predecessors require there to be <span class="font-italic">mutual debts or mutual dealings</span>. When Mr Manson <span class="font-italic">improperly withdrew money from the company this did not constitute a dealing between him and the company</span>. <span class="font-italic">A misappropriation of assets is not a dealing</span>. Mr Manson will object to the following analogy, but I hope he will forgive me for it is only an analogy: <span class="font-italic">the thief who steals my watch does not deal with me</span>. Similarly, <span class="font-italic">the man who steals money from a company does not obtain the money by a dealing within</span> r 4.90. Accordingly, his liability to repay money he has misappropriated cannot be set off against any debt owing to him by the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 A misappropriation of the insolvent company’s funds is not a “dealing” as the funds were improperly taken from the company without consent. Similarly, a conversion of property also cannot constitute a “dealing” (see the House of Lords decision in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Smith (Administrator of Cosslett</span> <span class="font-italic">(Contractors) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic">) v Bridgend County Borough Council </span>[2002] 1 AC 336 at [35]–[36]). Thus, as the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 271 observed at [67]: “as a general rule, statutory set-off is not available when the debt owed by the counterparty to the debtor is based on the misfeasance or other wrongdoing by the counterparty”. To permit a set-off in these circumstances would be unfair as it would favour the person who misappropriated the company assets and the wrongdoer could evade the consequences of his by recovery through set-off instead of having to prove in the winding up in competition with other creditors. This principle of law has also been applied to deny Insolvency Set-off in the context of dishonest assistance claims as well, as the court would be loath to “allow a dishonest assistor in effect to obtain pound for pound reimbursement” (see <span class="font-italic">Goldtrail</span><span class="font-italic"> Travel Ltd (in liquidation) v Aydin and others </span>[2015] 1 BCLC 89 at [167]; though the judgment decision overturned on appeal on a separate factual point in <span class="font-italic">Goldtrail</span><span class="font-italic"> Travel Ltd (in liquidation) v Aydin and others </span>[2016] 1 BCLC 635). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Therefore, I find that Insolvency Set-off under s 88(1) of the BA (read with s 327(2) of the CA) does not apply to claims arising from the Third Party Transactions as the misappropriation of assets do not constitute <span class="font-italic">mutual dealings</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 However, there is an <span class="font-italic">add</span><span class="font-italic">ed </span>complication to be dealt with here. The orthodox factual matrix where this issue arises is where the creditor who had misapplied company funds was ordered to restore the amount lost, and the creditor then asserts Insolvency Set-off as a <span class="font-italic">defence</span> against those claims. However, on the present facts, the rather unusual feature of the case is that the Kyen Liquidators are the ones seeking to assert the Insolvency Set-off, rather than the creditor (Feima). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Ultimately, it does not matter materially which party seeks to assert Insolvency Set-off (and the Kyen Liquidators cannot waive such a set-off even if they wished to) because Insolvency Set-off is mandatory and self-executing by operation of law <span class="font-italic">irrespective</span> of the parties’ wishes (as I have set out above at [68]). Thus, regardless of which party is attempting to invoke the Insolvency Set-off, this cannot be permitted <span class="font-italic">in both scenarios </span>(whether it is the liquidator invoking it or the creditor) as the misappropriation of assets simply do not constitute mutual dealings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Kyen Liquidators have successfully proved their counterclaims founded on dishonest assistance and knowing receipt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As I have said above, given that I have found that the Kyen Liquidators are not justified in accounting for the counterclaims in the adjudication of the Proof of Debt given the complex factual matrix and issues underlying these (without resolving these intricate issues at trial), I should not go further to consider the validity of its counterclaims in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to express any view on the merits of these claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Kyen Liquidators’ “primary ground” for rejection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For the reasons given above, I reject the Kyen Liquidators’ “primary ground” for rejection of the Proof of Debt. I turn now to consider their “alternative grounds” for rejection.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Kyen Liquidators’ “alternative grounds” for rejection should be affirmed</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Having concluded that the Kyen Liquidators’ “primary ground” for rejecting the Proof of Debt founded on the counterclaims must fail, I turn to their “alternative grounds”. In summary, the defendants argue generally that the Proof of Debt must be subject to “strict proof” because Feima is not only Kyen’s parent company with common directors between them, but there were also extensive contractual and personnel arrangements that allowed Feima to influence Kyen’s affairs and to effect intercompany transfers with great ease.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision: a heightened scrutiny of the Proof of Debt is not necessary in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The applicable law</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) No general need for heightened scrutiny for cases involving related companies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In my view, a so-called “heightened scrutiny” is not generally necessary for cases involving related companies because it adds nothing to the usual principle that the burden is on Feima to prove its debt on a balance of probabilities. Indeed, it does not add anything to this principle to say that the creditor is to be put to “strict proof”. All that might be meaningfully said is that the <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> required to discharge the burden placed on the creditor might differ in every case depending on the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Ice-Mack </span>was quite a different case from the present facts. In <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Ice-Mack</span>, an issue arose as to whether the pages from the applicant company’s ledger books were sufficient proof of debt against a company that was being wound up. The creditor and debtor companies were “related” in that the same person, Mr Valibhoy, managed both companies. Yong Pung How J (as he then was) stated (at [11]) that in an arms-length situation, an audit confirmation would be strong evidence of the correctness of the credit or debit balance. However, as that confirmation was signed on behalf of the company by the same person managing the associated companies (Mr Valibhoy), it could not be accepted as evidence of the debt unless it was corroborated by more independent evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I therefore do not read <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Ice-Mack </span>as standing for a <span class="font-italic">general</span> proposition that a heightened scrutiny is necessary once there is a close relationship and/or common controllers with the company in liquidation. Indeed, what the cases reveal is that <span class="font-italic">more evidence</span> is needed only if there are circumstances warranting suspicion. Thus, in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Capital Realty Pte Ltd v Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Thye Enterprises (Pte) Ltd </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 419 (“<span class="font-italic">Capital Realty</span>”) at [24], Chao Hick Tin JA held that an audit confirmation was strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence of debt. Chao JA distinguished the case of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Ice-Mack </span>as being inapplicable (at [31]) since there were no circumstances warranting suspicion on the signing of the audit confirmation despite the close friendship of the debtor and creditor. Indeed, the mere close friendship between the debtor and creditor does not, without more, raise any suspicion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) “Triggers” that will raise a court’s suspicion to require more evidence in cases involving related companies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 However, there will be certain “triggers” that will raise a court’s suspicion to require more evidence in a given case. Coming back to the case of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Ice-Mack</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>while the creditor’s own audited financial statements were provided, the statements did not attest to any debt owed by the company at all. The only thing shown was that Mr Valibhoy owed a debt to the creditor, but the applicant had failed to produce proper evidence of the various loans and payments it had allegedly made for and on behalf of the insolvent company. The court rejected Mr Valibhoy’s explanation that he had agreed to bear the debt that was originally incurred by the company personally so that the creditor would not be put to loss as a result of the company’s winding up. The explanation was rejected because the debt was incurred before the company was wound up and the company’s own audited accounts did not lend any support to the existence of the alleged debt. Those circumstances led the court to reject the only documentary evidence in support of the proof of debt – which was a solitary audit confirmation by the debtor company signed by Mr Valibhoy himself. It should be noted that the court’s suspicion was only triggered in that case because Mr Valibhoy’s explanation did not square with the facts, rather than based <span class="font-italic">purely </span>on the mere presence of the connection between Mr Valibhoy and the insolvent company <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Similarly, the Hong Kong High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Adam Holdings Ltd </span>[1985] 2 HKC 608 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Adam Holdings</span>”) stands as an example of when a court’s suspicion was triggered. In that case, a creditor who was the subsidiary of a company that was also compulsorily wound up submitted a proof of debt to the Official Receiver. This proof was supported by ledger entries of the group of companies, and a draft account sent to the creditor by the debtor company, prepared by accountants, to confirm the balance due. However, no audited statements were produced. The primary documents were also lost. The ledger entries were also filled with discrepancies. Given these discrepancies and the overall state of the evidence tendered in support of the proof of debt, Jones J rejected the proof of debt. Once again, the court’s suspicion was triggered, not by the mere fact that the credit was related to the insolvent company, but by the discrepancies in the accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In all these cases, there was something specific, whether it be a material discrepancy in the factual account provided by the creditor or inconsistencies within the documentary record, that triggered the court’s suspicion. This then led to the court needing more evidence such as the production of the primary documents. Once again, it is not just the mere presence of a close relationship between the insolvent company and the creditor that, by itself, led to the court requiring more than the production of audited financial statements. Indeed, given the prevalence of related companies, a rule to this effect would be impractical and run counter to the need for efficiency in the liquidation process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Facts that will negate need for more evidence in cases involving related companies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 On the contrary, there are facts that will <span class="font-italic">negate </span>the need for more evidence in cases involving related companies. In this regard, the Hong Kong High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Grand Gain Investment Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Cosimo Borrelli and another </span>[2006] HKCU 872 (at [18]) that weight should be given to the fact that the accounts concerned have been audited. This is since the audit process requires the auditor to be satisfied that the accounts provide a true and fair of the company’s financial position. However, if there is a “trigger” fact, such as evidence that shows that the accounts are or may be inaccurate, or doubt is cast on the manner in which the auditor carried out his duties, that will certainly be a factor the court will consider. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 This was also alluded to in <span class="font-italic">Capital Realty</span>, where the Court of Appeal held that audit confirmation constituted strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of a debt (at [24]). Unlike the case of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Adam Holdings</span>, it appeared that there were no discrepancies in the record of debts in any of the audited statements in <span class="font-italic">Capital Realty</span> such that any suspicions were raised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Summary of the overall position involving the need for more evidence for cases involving related companies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>A summary of the overall position as to the approach to be taken on the evidence required to support a proof (even those given by a <span class="font-italic">connected</span><span class="font-italic">/related party</span>), as well as the application of these principles, can be gleaned from the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>(at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It seems to us that the overriding concern of the courts in all the above cases was to ensure that that legitimate creditors and contributories of a company should not be prejudiced by spurious claims made by related parties under the guise of being creditors. What is spurious would depend on the facts of each case. The principle that can also be gleaned from this brief overview is that the duty of the liquidator in assessing a proof of debt is to ensure that while genuine debts are admitted and false claims are rejected, he must act <span class="font-italic">fairly </span>in discharging his duties. He must, at all times, be independent and hold an even hand in dealing with the often competing interests of creditors, contributories and his appointers. <span class="font-italic">A liquidator must never favour the interests of his appointers over that of the other legitimate claimants to the company’s assets</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As such, the Court of Appeal laid down key principles and frameworks to be applied when assessing the judgment made by the liquidator. First, although a liquidator had extensive powers to go behind documents, a liquidator must have a reasonable basis on which to query a debt that appeared to be genuine (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [20]). A proof of debt should not be lightly rejected if the debt had been consistently acknowledged in audited accounts or through audit confirmation statements (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 A liquidator is thus only bound to take extraordinary steps to scrutinise a proof of debt on the basis that it could be a false claim in cases where he has reason to be suspicious about its genuineness or legal validity. The factors to be considered include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [20]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the origins of the debt, </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the length of time the debt has been due, </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) how the company has treated the debt in its financial statements, </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the business of the debtor company; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the relationships between the claimants and the controlling shareholders of the company. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In assessing these factors, the liquidator must rely on: (a) knowledge of the general principles of company accounting, (b) the auditing practice of companies by independent auditors, (c) the effect and implication of directors’ and shareholders’ approvals annually of company accounts made in compliance with the law, (d) the customary insolvency practice in verifying debts, and (e) some degree of common sense in understanding human relationships (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 By way of application, in <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>, the liquidator rejected the creditor’s proof of debt because, among others, the creditor company was a related party and there was no independent confirmation of the underlying transactions through primary supporting documents or witnesses. The court disagreed and found the debt to be genuine for the following reasons (at [27]–[30]): (a) the insolvent company had consistently acknowledged the debt in question, the accounts were complete and did not contain discrepancies, (b) the figures in the audited financial statements, the audit confirmations, the ledger entries and the creditor’s audited financial statements all corroborated each other, and (c) the fact that the auditors relied on a common director (behind the creditor and insolvent company) for information did not <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> suggest that the accounts stated were wrong.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I come now to apply these principles to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Application to the present case</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) No need for a wholesale insistence of more evidence </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 To begin with, I do not agree with the Kyen Liquidators’ insistence that it is necessary for <span class="font-italic">each </span><span class="font-italic">and every</span> debt claimed by Feima to be independently verified with reference to the relevant supporting documents before they can be admitted. Indeed, this <span class="font-italic">wholesale</span> insistence on the primary documents for every debt reveals a pre-existing reluctance to consider each debt on its own merits and to only require for the supporting documents where necessary. Indeed, this was something which the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> was careful to guard against (at [21]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… while we accept that the burden of proof ordinarily rests on the creditor to substantiate a proof of debt <span class="font-italic">this does not mean that the only means</span> by which a creditor can prove a proof of debt must be through the <span class="font-italic">production of primary documents</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) No “triggers” that require more evidence in respect of specific claims</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 More specifically, unlike the cases of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Ice-Mack </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Adam Holdings</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>I do not think that there are “triggers” in the present case that warrant the court requiring more evidence than is usual in respect of Feima’s claims. This is because, on a general level, Feima’s claim is supported by different financial documents which corroborate each other. These documents include (a) the detailed ledger of Feima, together with the underlying <span class="font-italic">supporting documents </span>for many of the entries listed within, (b) the <span class="font-italic">audited </span>financial statements of both Kyen and Feima, and (c) a Kyen statement of affairs filed by one of its directors with the Kyen Liquidators.

We therefore agreed the Company’s full impairment for the amount due from Kyen Resources Pte.

Instead, it only stated that the auditors agreed to a full impairment of Kyen’s debt to Feima because the auditors assessed that the debt’s recoverability was low given Kyen’s liquidation, and that the debt remained unsettled and long outstanding. The auditor’s letter is prefaced by the words “[a]ccording to the Company’s records” (which could mean that the auditors took the information given to them at face value) before stating that the value of the debts due from Kyen, and the auditors do not actually confirm that they had specifically audited and assessed the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">legitimacy</span> of the debt in question by reviewing all the relevant supporting documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Nevertheless, as against this, there are the audited statements from 2017 which showed that there was a debt of HKD 505,727,215 that was payable by Kyen to Feima as at 31 December 2017 (see [8(b)] above), and the 2017 statements corroborated the Proof of Debt. What is pertinent to note is that within the 2017 statements, the auditors gave the opinion that except for other matters (which do not concern the debt owing by Kyen to Feima), the “financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of [Feima] as at 31 December 2017”.

Notably, there was a similar circumstance which occurred in <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA</span>) where the earlier audited financial statements were unqualified by auditors, but then the later financial statements became qualified (at [28]). Despite this, the Court of Appeal did not necessarily find this fatal to admitting the proof of debt as there were other corroborating information. Coming back to the present facts, the fact that the 2018 statements had qualifications does not necessarily mean that the earlier set of accounts must be discarded entirely (especially given that the 2017 statements covered the larger sum of HKD 505,727,215). Further, the fact that the Proof of Debt was a debt that Kyen had <span class="font-italic">itself</span> consistently acknowledged as being owed and unpaid within its <span class="font-italic">own</span> audited financial statements in 2017 (without qualification) and in its statement of affairs, meant that Feima’s Proof of Debt should not be lightly rejected, because “[s]uch acknowledgements amount to an admission of the debt” (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Kyen’s audited financial statements can be relied on</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 For completeness, the defendants also argue that Kyen’s audited financial statements in 2017 and Kyen’s statement of affairs cannot be relied upon. I turn to these arguments now.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As for Kyen’s audited financial statements in 2017, the defendants’ objection is that these statements are unreliable because they were prepared under the control and supervision of Feima. Further, while having such control and supervision, Feima was involved in the Third Party Transactions. As such, the defendants say that there is a legitimate concern over the probative value of these accounts and the Kyen Liquidators are hence justified in going beyond Kyen’s accounts.

</div> I do not agree with this submission. In the first place, I do not think that the Kyen Liquidators have successfully raised any suspicion that is needed to trigger a heightened scrutiny of the documents. Their assertions of the alleged Third Party Transactions, which are connected to their counterclaims in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt, cannot be resolved simply on the Kyen Liquidators’ own adjudication. Second, Kyen’s financial statements are audited without qualification of the debt in question (as I have mentioned at [109] above). Kyen’s auditors have in their independent audit report stated that the financial statements for FY2017 have been properly drawn up in accordance with the statutory requirements. These statements are assessed to give a true and fair view of Kyen’s financial position as at 31 December 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>, a similar complaint was raised as the controlling common director of both the creditor and insolvent companies was the source from which the auditors had gleaned their financial information.

Second, the statement of affairs serves a merely corroborative function and Feima does not need to depend on it for the Proof of Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Having concluded that there is nothing on the facts to cause me to generally doubt the reliability of (a) Feima’s audited financial statements, (b) Kyen’s audited financial statements, and (c) Kyen’s director’s statement of affairs, I now consider if Feima has successfully made out its claims based on these financial statements, as well as its general ledger and other supporting documents.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether Feima has made out its claims</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Overview of Feima’s claims </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I turn first to Feima’s detailed ledger to meet the defendants’ argument that Feima had not produced the underlying agreements or bank payment advices for its claims. In my judgment, the detailed ledger has set out more than 200 transactions that Feima had with Kyen from 2016 onwards. It shows clearly that the USD 49,355,996.30 claimed in the Proof of Debt as comprising, amongst other things, the following balances:

The defendants’ general objection is that Feima’s bank payment advices do not identify any underlying basis or justification for the transactions that had taken place. I do not accept this objection as being capable of rejecting the Proof of Debt in relation to the USD 25,824,511.08 outright. As I said above, there is no particular “trigger” that would justify me taking a heightened scrutiny of the claims in the Proof of Debt. I therefore do not accept that I should go behind each and every of the claims, including the bank payment advices, to ascertain the underlying basis or justification for the transaction. This would go beyond the pale and I do not think this is necessary for the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Going then into the specifics, in the first place, out of the USD 25,824,511.08 due from Kyen to Feima as a result of the sale of goods, the Kyen Liquidators have not raised any challenge to USD 3,348,040.47. Thus, leaving aside the Kyen Liquidators’ objections to the other claims, this sum of USD 3,348,040.47 claimed in the Proof of Debt should be admitted. Indeed, Mr Chan confirmed before me that if I were not with him on the “primary” ground of rejection, then this sum of USD 3,348,040.47, being unchallenged by the Kyen Liquidators, should be admitted. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum of USD 3,348,040.47 is derived from the balance of USD 25,824,511.08 stated in the general ledger, <span class="font-italic">less </span>USD 5,067,813.82 and USD 590,505.97 arising from the allegedly non-genuine transactions (which I will consider below), and <span class="font-italic">less </span>USD 16,818,150.82 being the amounts assigned to SPDB and for which Feima no longer claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I turn then to the remaining claim of USD 5,067,813.82 and USD 590,505.97 under this head. This claim arises out of Purchase Contract P-CU-F192 entered into between Kyen and Feima for the sale of copper cathodes by Feima to Kyen (“the Purchase Contract”). The Kyen Liquidators’ objection is premised on the fact (a) that they are unable to locate any documentary evidence of the goods being delivered to Kyen pursuant to the Purchase Contract, and (b) that, in the ordinary course of Kyen’s business, Kyen would purchase the copper cathodes first and then sell them to a third party. In this respect, the Kyen Liquidators were unable to find any evidence to suggest that the copper cathodes were ever sold to a third party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I reject the Kyen Liquidators’ reasons for objection for the following reasons. First, I reject the Kyen Liquidators’ reason that they are unable to locate any documentary evidence of the goods being delivered to Kyen. In this regard, the Purchase Contract states that the copper cathodes are to be delivered to Shanghai, China. The relevant bills of lading do show the delivery of the copper cathodes to Shanghai.

</div> In addition, there are contemporaneous documents showing that the transaction had taken place. For instance, Feima had issued a final invoice reflecting the figures concerned, a debit note for the sum of USD 590,505.97 was issued on 18 July 2018, and the Purchase Contract was formally entered into between Feima and Kyen on 4 July 2018. Finally, the general ledger and audited financial statements of both Feima and Kyen support and confirm the contemporaneous documents that this balance is being owed. I do not think that the Kyen Liquidators, when faced with these documents, can simply reject the claim on the basis that they were unable to locate any documentary evidence of the goods being delivered to Kyen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 More broadly, I do not think that there is any fact which might trigger suspicion that the transaction is fictitious. Indeed, as Feima points out, the general ledger shows numerous transactions between Feima and Kyen for the sale of goods by Kyen to Feima since 2016. The fact is that there has been a consistent pattern of such business dealings since 2016, which have all been documented in a consistent manner. The Kyen Liquidators cannot pick a single transaction and dispute it on the basis that they cannot find the relevant documents, when they have not challenged the other transactions which have been documented in a similar manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Accordingly, in relation to the USD 25,824,511.08 due from Kyen to Feima as a result of goods sold by Feima to Kyen, I reject the Kyen Liquidators’ decision to reject:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) USD 3,348,040.47, which has not been challenged;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) USD 5,067,813.82 and USD 590,505.97, for which I reject the reasons for rejection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I, however, affirm the Kyen Liquidators’ decision to reject the USD 16,818,150.82, being the amount assigned to SPDB and for which Feima no longer claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) RMB 124,145,239.85 due from Kyen to Feima as a result of payments made by Feima to or on behalf of Kyen</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In respect of the RMB 124,145,239.85 due from Kyen to Feima as a result of payments made by Feima to or on behalf of Kyen, the Kyen Liquidators’ objection is that “there is insufficient evidence that these were genuine transactions made by [Feima] on [Kyen’s] behalf”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I reject the Kyen Liquidators’ rejection of this claim. In my judgment, the claim of RMB 124,145,239.85 is supported by evidence found in the ledger, the bank transaction confirmations that support the entries in the ledger, and which are corroborated by Kyen and Feima’s audited financial statements and by the Kyen’s director’s statement of affairs. I agree with Feima that the bank transfer confirmations show <span class="font-italic">real transfers</span>. The ledger, audited financial statements and statement of affairs then <span class="font-italic">confirm </span>that these transfers give rise to a debt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) USD 5,182,755.32 due from Kyen to Feima as a result of payments made by Feima to Kyen or on Kyen’s behalf</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In relation to the USD 5,182,755.32 due from Kyen to Feima as a result of payments made by Feima to Kyen or on Kyen’s behalf, the Feima Liquidators have provided a ledger showing that this sum was arrived at after a series of 90 USD transactions which took place from 17 February 2016 to 31 July 2019. These 90 transactions reflected in the general ledger comprise of transactions showing:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) USD payments made from Kyen (either by Kyen itself or on Kyen’s behalf) to Feima.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) USD payments made by Feima either directly to Kyen or on Kyen’s behalf. This included legal fees paid on behalf of Kyen of USD 100,000 on 10 December 2018 and of USD 50,000 on 2 April 2019 (“the Legal Fees”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Management fees of USD 2,000,000 due from Kyen to Feima for 2017 (this being the basis of the Management Fees Claim, see [15(b)(ii)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The Kyen Liquidators have made specific objections to the Legal Fees and the Management Fees Claim, which I will deal with. But apart from these specific objections, the Kyen Liquidators’ objection to the remainder of the USD 5,182,755.32 is premised on similar objections as above that centre on the lack of evidence. I reject these objections for the same reasons as above. Indeed, in respect of this sum of USD 5,182,755.32, I note that for each payment that has been made, at least a copy of the bank confirmation statement or advice has been provided. These documents show the date of the transfer, the parties to the transfer, and the bank account involved in the transfer, and in some instances, documents showing exactly what the payment was for. I therefore do not accept the Kyen Liquidators’ objection founded on lack of documentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I turn to the Legal Fees. The Kyen Liquidators’ rejection is based on there being no evidence of the relevant legal services being provided. More importantly, Feima was not even the party which made the relevant payments. In this regard, the Kyen Liquidators reject Feima’s explanation that a third party, Uni-Tops International (Hong Kong) Ltd (“Uni-Tops”) had made payment of the amount on Feima’s behalf, as there is no evidence that Kyen agreed to be liable to Feima for the payments made by Uni-Tops. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">130 </span>I disagree with the Kyen Liquidators’ rejection. Instead, I accept the Feima Liquidator’s explanation, which is based on the provision of (a<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> the Special Legal Service Contract governing the provision of legal services from the law firm to Kyen, (b) email correspondence showing that the USD 150,000 was expressly noted by Kyen’s staff as expenses of Kyen, and (c) Feima’s journal vouchers showing that the payment to Kyen’s law firm by Uni-Tops resulted in an amount due by Feima to Uni-Tops. I agree that it is likely that the journal vouchers were recorded in this manner is that Uni-Tops was paying on behalf of Feima and this was the conclusion of the investigations.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I turn then to the Management Fees Claim. This claim is based on a signed Management and Administrative Services Agreement between Feima and Kyen that expressly provides at Clause 5.2 that Kyen shall pay Feima a management fee of USD 2,000,000 for such calendar year or other mutually agreed amount. The Kyen Liquidators’ rejection is based on Feima’s alleged knowing receipt of and dishonest assistance in relation to the Third Party Transactions. As a result, the Kyen Liquidators say that Feima has breached Clause 4.1 of the Management and Administrative Services Agreement, which require the Manager to serve Kyen in good faith. By breach of this clause, the Kyen Liquidators say that Feima is not entitled to the fees under the Management and Administrative Services Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I reject this rejection on the ground that the Kyen Liquidators have not made out their counterclaims in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. As I have said above, the proper avenue for adjudicating on these heavily fact-dependent claims is not the adjudication procedure. Accordingly, the very premise of the Kyen Liquidators’ rejection, namely, the breach of Clause 4.1 has not been established. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Kyen Liquidators’ “secondary ground” for rejection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In summary, I disagree with the Kyen Liquidators’ rejection of the following claims in the Proof of Debt.
