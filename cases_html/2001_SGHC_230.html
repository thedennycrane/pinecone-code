<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.In this case, the plaintiff, Madam Koh Kim Eng, sought a

declaration that a half share of No 63 Jalan Bangsawan is held by her sister-in-law, the

defendant, Madam Lim Geok Yian, on trust for her, and an order that Madam Lim transfer the

said half share to her. 

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Background</p></i>
</u><font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>2.Madam Koh married Mr Chua Chi Moo, whose younger brother, Mr

Chua Ki Seng, married Madam Lim. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>3.At the material time, the two brothers, Mr Chua Chi Moo and Mr

Chua Ki Seng, were partners of a firm, Federal Electronics &amp; Trading Co (hereinafter

referred to as "FETC"). 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>4.It is not disputed that FETC paid for two properties. The

first, No 63 Jalan Bangsawan (hereinafter referred to as the "Bangsawan

property"), was purchased for $175,000 in April 1980. A loan of $105,000 was provided

by Malayan Banking Berhad for the purchase of the said property. As the Bangsawan property

was originally intended to be the matrimonial home for both the brothers, it was

registered in the names of the two brothers’ wives, both being tenants-in-common with

equal shares. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>5.Upon completion of the purchase of the said property, only

Madam Koh and her family moved into the Bangsawan property. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>6.On or about January 1981, FETC’s funds were used to

purchase a second property, No 19B Sam Leong Mansion (hereinafter referred to as the

"Sam Leong property"), an apartment, for $170,000. A loan of $90,000 was

obtained from Chung Khiaw Bank to finance the purchase of this property. Although the

funds required for the purchase of the Sam Leong property were provided by both brothers,

it was registered in the sole name of Madam Lim. After the completion of the sale and

purchase, she and her family moved into the apartment. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>7.Madam Koh alleged that the Sam Leong property was registered

in the sole name of Madam Lim on the clear understanding that she would in return give up

her half share of the Bangsawan property. She asserted that it was agreed that upon the

completion of the sale and purchase of the Sam Leong property, Madam Lim’s registered

half share of the Bangsawan property would be held on trust for her. This was denied by

Madam Lim.

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>8.The Bangsawan and Sam Leong properties were subsequently

re-mortgaged to Chung Khiaw Bank for the purpose of obtaining funds for the family

business, which was subsequently converted to a limited company, known as Federal

Electronics Pte Ltd. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>9.By the 1990s, Madam Lim and her husband had marital problems

and he moved out of the matrimonial home. On 5 December 2000, Madam Lim’s solicitors,

Choo &amp; Joethy, wrote to Chung Khiaw Bank to serve notice that she wanted the mortgage

of the Bangsawan and Sam Leong properties discharged. The letter stated as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We act under the instructions of Ms Lim Geok Yian, the legal owner of:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol xmlns="">
<li>No 19 Sam Leong Road, Sam Leong Mansion, in her sole name; and</li>
<li>No 63 Jalan Bangsawan as tenant-in-common in equal shares with her sister-in-law, Ms Koh

    Kim Eng.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We are instructed by our client that the two pieces of property above

  captioned were and are mortgaged to your good office sometime in September 1983 in order

  to secure a loan and overdraft facilities for Messrs Federal Electronics Pte Ltd

  ("the Company") of which she was/is a director.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon her instructions, we are giving you Notice that she would like to

  have the existing mortgage discharged.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>10.In response, Madam Koh’s solicitors, Lee Bon Leong &amp;

Co, wrote to Choo &amp; Joethy on 9 February 2001 to request Madam Lim to transfer her

half share in the Bangsawan property to Madam Koh. The letter was in the following terms:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We are instructed by our client that by letter of 5.12.2000 under the

  instructions of your client Ms Lim Geok Yian, you wrote to the Manager of Chung Khiaw Bank

  Limited ("CKBL") claiming that your client is the legal owner as

  tenant-in-common in equal shares with our client and also giving notice that she would

  like to have the existing mortgage discharged.</p>
<p align="justify">We are instructed that your client is fully aware that although she is

  registered as a tenant-in-common in equal shares with our client, she is not the legal

  owner or beneficial owner but merely holding the same in trust for our client.</p>
<p align="justify">This property was bought in 1980 as a matrimonial property of our

  client and her husband, Mr Chua Chi Moo, and they have lived there since together with

  their children. This property is also mortgaged to CKBL for facilities for Federal

  Electronics Pte Ltd, our client’s husband’s business. Our client has no

  intention of discharging the mortgage.</p>
<p align="justify">We are now instructed to and hereby give your client Notice to take

  steps to transfer the half share registered under her name to our client forthwith.</p>
<p align="justify">Please let us hear from you within seven (7) days from the date hereof

  as to whether your client is prepared to do so, failing which our client shall commence

  action against your client without any further reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>11.Choo &amp; Joethy replied on 26 February 2001 and denied that

Madam Lim held her half share of the Bangsawan property on trust for Madam Koh. In view of

the stand adopted by Madam Lim, Madam Koh instituted the present action.

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p>Section 7 of the Civil Law Act</p></i></u><font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>12.It ought to be noted that there was no written evidence of

the existence of the alleged trust. Section 7(1) of the Civil Law Act provides as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A declaration of trust respecting any immovable property or any

  interest in such property must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some

  person who is able to declare such trust or by his will. </p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>13.However, section 7(3) of the said Act provides that the

requirement of written evidence does not affect the creation or operation of resulting,

implied or constructive trusts. As such, if Madam Koh can establish that Madam Lim is a

constructive trustee of her half share of the Bangsawan property, this case is unaffected

by section 7(1) of the Civil Law Act.

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p>Evidence of Madam Koh and the two brothers</p></i></u><font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>14.Madam Koh’s case is that it is improbable, and even

incredible, that she and the two brothers would combine their financial resources to

benefit Madam Lim in such a disproportionate manner when they purchased the two

properties. After all, the family business which provided the funds for the purchase of

the said properties was started by the two brothers. Furthermore, the price paid for both

properties was approximately the same, one being $175,000 while the other was $170,000 and

the family business had utilised both properties to obtain credit facilities.

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>15.Madam Koh contended that Madam Lim’s refusal to honour

the agreed arrangements on the ownership of the Bangsawan and Sam Leong properties is

inequitable and vindictive. She pointed out that Madam Lim should not be allowed to

benefit unjustly from the trust placed on her by the family.

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>16.Madam Koh’s husband, Mr Chua Chi Moo, testified that his

wife’s version of the arrangements relating to the division of the Bangsawan and Sam

Leong properties is correct. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>17.Madam Lim’s husband, Mr Chua Ki Seng, also supported his

sister-in-law’s claim. In para 4 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he said as

follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I confirm that my only matrimonial property is 19B Sam Leong Mansion

  Singapore. No 63 Jalan Bangsawan Singapore is the matrimonial home of my brother and the

  Plaintiff, and the Defendant and myself have no interest in the property.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>18.When cross-examined, Mr Chua Ki Seng reiterated that it had

been agreed that the Bangsawan property would belong to Madam Koh after the purchase of

the Sam Leong property. He said as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">After the property at 63 Jalan Bangsawan was bought, my elder brother

  and I had several discussions and we mentioned that should we purchase another property,

  the second property would go to my family while my brother would keep the first property

  at Jalan Bangsawan. We viewed quite a number of properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>19.Mr Chua Ki Seng, who was clearly disappointed that his wife

had not stood by the agreed arrangements on the ownership of the two properties, also

explained why the Sam Leong property was not put in the names of the two wives as the

first property at Jalan Bangsawan had been in the following terms:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There is a Chinese saying that had we known that this would have

  happened, we would not have done what we did. The first property was in the names of both

  our wives because it was our intention to have both families move into that property.

  However, as the second property was intended to be my home, it was put in my wife’s

  name.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>20.When asked why the question of ownership was not settled at

the lawyer’s office when they were there to sign the documents for the purchase of

the Sam Leong property, Mr Chua Ki Seng said as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Jalan Bangsawan was mortgaged to the bank and all of us were aware of

  that. We knew that one property was for my brother and one for us. Prices for the

  properties were the same. I am a traditional Chinese man and as far as my brother and I

  are concerned, we act on what we say. Once we have given our word, it’s good enough.

  We never renege on our promise. Money was made by my brother and I.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>21.A relevant question which arises is why it took Madam Koh

more than 20 years to assert her claim against Madam Lim. When cross-examined, Madam Koh

explained as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Why did you take 20 years to claim the trust property?</p>
<p align="justify">A. We were living in harmony and it was only when we received a letter

  from her lawyer informing us that she wanted to collect the title deed to the Bangsawan

  property that I approached my lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Q. The defendant merely wanted to redeem the mortgage?</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A. When I said that she wanted to collect the title deed, I meant that

  she wanted to claim her half share.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>22.I believe Madam Koh. Although she should have had the

property transferred to her much earlier, the two brothers had utilised the Bangsawan

property as security for loans to their business. As the family was then living in harmony

and the question of ownership of the Bangsawan property appeared to have been amicably

settled, she did not think it necessary to take steps to have the property registered

solely in her name. I believe that had Madam Lim not fallen out with her husband and not

written to the bank to stake her claim after 20 years to a half share in the Bangsawan

property, these proceedings would not have been initiated by Madam Koh.

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p>Madam Lim’s evidence</p></i></u><font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>23.Madam Lim denied the existence of the trust. According to

her, she and her family did not move into the said property because she wanted to

accommodate Madam Koh, who had a large family and was then living in dilapidated rented

premises at Kelantan Lane. She added that she allowed Madam Koh to have exclusive use of

the property out of sympathy and compassion. She asserted that the first time she was

informed by Madam Koh that the Bangsawan property was being held in trust for her was when

Madam Koh’s solicitors wrote to her on 9 February 2001. She also pointed out that

when the Sam Leong property was bought, no one requested her to transfer the Bangsawan

property to Madam Koh and her husband did not ask her to see a solicitor to sign a Deed of

Trust declaring that she held 50% of the said property on trust for Madam Koh.

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>24.Madam Lim’s evidence does not support her claim to half

of the Bangsawan property. To begin with, she knew the source of the funds for the

purchase of the Bangsawan property. When cross-examined, she said as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q. Did the funds to purchase the Bangsawan property come from Federal Electronics &amp;

  Trading Co?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>25..Madam Lim also knew where the money for the purchase of her

apartment at Sam Leong Mansion came from. When cross-examined, she said as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q. When the property at Sam Leong Mansion was bought, did you know where the funds came

  from?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>A. Yes, the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>Q. The company belongs to your husband and his brother?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>26.Madam Lim could not explain why her brother-in-law would

agree to let her have sole ownership of the Sam Leong property without requiring her to

give up her interest in the Bangsawan property to his wife. When cross-examined, her

explanation was confusing and unconvincing. She said as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. The Sam Leong property was registered in your name although your

  brother-in-law contributed to the funds to purchase it?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Are you saying this was something your brother-in-law gave to you? </p>
<p align="justify">A. My husband gave it to me. Since the decision was made by the

  brothers, it was in my name. I don’t know whether my brother-in-law gave it to me. I

  am not claiming it as mine. It could have been deducted from my husband’s account. </p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>27. When pressed, Madam Lim admitted that she did not know

whether the sum paid for Sam Leong Mansion had been deducted from her husband’s

account. When cross-examined, she said:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. You don’t know that as a fact?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. By the same token, your brother-in-law could have paid for the Sam

  Leong Mansion apartment entirely.</p>
<p align="justify">A. I don’t know. </p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>28. Madam Lim subsequently conceded that her brother-in-law

could not, by putting his money into the Sam Leong property, have intended it as a gift to

her. When cross-examined, she said:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. I put it to you that if the Sam Leong property was bought with

  company funds and put in your name, it could not have been a gift from the

  plaintiff’s husband to you.</p>
<p align="justify">A. <i>Definitely not a gift from my brother-in-law.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>29.It is also important to note that Madam Lim conceded that she

had no say in the purchase of the two properties and that all decisions regarding the

purchase of property were made by her husband and his brother. When cross-examined, she

said as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q. Was it after you decided not to move into the Jalan Bangsawan

  property that you looked for another property?</p>
<p align="justify">A. That was not a decision for me to make. Whatever decisions were made

  where property is concerned, they were made by the two brothers.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>30.Subsequently, in reply to a question about company matters,

she reiterated that she had no say in the purchase of the properties when she said as

follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This is the typical Chinese family business. Even for the buying of

  properties, the ladies have no say. <u><i>Only the men make the decisions</i></u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>31.In view of Madam Lim’s evidence that decisions regarding

the purchase of properties were made by the two brothers, the fact that both brothers had

given clear evidence that all the parties concerned had agreed that the Bangsawan property

belonged to Madam Koh and the Sam Leong Mansion belonged to Madam Lim cannot be ignored.

As such, a question arises as to whether Madam Lim is a constructive trustee of her half

share of the Bangsawan property. 

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p>Whether there was a constructive trust</p></i></u><font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>32.The nature of a constructive trust has been elucidated in

innumerable cases. Relevant to the present case is the following passage from <i xmlns="">Halsbury’s

Laws of England, </i>4<sup xmlns="">th</sup> ed, Vol 48, para 586<i xmlns="">:

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[I]f a person attempts to assert full beneficial ownership of property

  by relying unconscionably on the absence of the statutory formalities requisite for

  another person’s interest, he will be treated as holding the property on constructive

  trust for that other person. </p>
</blockquote></i>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>33.In a recent case, <i xmlns="">Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp;

Co </i>[1999] 1 All ER 400, 409, Millett LJ said:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A constructive trust arises by operation of law whenever the

  circumstance are such that it would be unconscionable for the owner of property (usually

  but not necessarily the legal estate) to assert his own beneficial interest in the

  property and deny the beneficial interest of another. In the first class of case, …

  the constructive trustee really is a trustee. He does not receive the trust property in

  his own right but by a transaction by which both parties intend to create a trust from the

  outset and which is not impugned by the plaintiff. His possession of the property is

  coloured from the first by the trust and confidence by means of which he obtained it, and

  his subsequent appropriation of the property to his own use is a breach of that trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>34. I believe that Madam Koh, her husband and Madam Lim’s

husband are telling the truth regarding the arrangements with respect to the purchase of

the Bangsawan and Sam Leong properties. I do not believe that Madam Lim was unaware of the

arrangements regarding her relinquishing of her half share of the Bangsawan property in

return for the Sam Leong apartment being purchased in her name. 

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>35. There being a clear understanding between all the parties in

the present case that Madam Lim would give up her half share in the Bangsawan property in

return for having the Sam Leong property registered solely in her name, it would be

unconscionable for her to claim an interest in the Bangsawan property. To borrow

Millett’s LJ’s words in <i xmlns="">Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; Co </i>[1999] 1 All ER 400, 409, which apply,<i xmlns=""> mutatis mutandis</i>,<i xmlns=""> </i>to the present case, Madam

Lim’s possession of the Sam Leong property is coloured from the first by the trust

and confidence by means of which she obtained it.

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>36. Madam Koh has certainly altered her position as a result of

the common understanding regarding the ownership of the Bangsawan property. Had Madam Lim

not agreed that she would give up her share in the Bangsawan property after the purchase

of the Sam Leong property, Madam Koh and her husband could have made other arrangements to

ensure a more equitable distribution of the two properties. For more than 20 years, Madam

Koh relied on the agreed arrangements. Madam Lim cannot be allowed to upset these

arrangements.

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>37. Madam Koh thus succeeds in her application to have Madam

Lim’s half share in the Bangsawan property transferred to her. Madam Koh is entitled

to costs.
