</p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p><b>The Parties</b></p>
<p align="justify">1.    The plaintiff (‘Arul’) is a practising

advocate and solicitor in Singapore and a member of the Tanglin Club (‘Club’).

The defendant, an architect, is another member of the Club and a Justice of the Peace in

Singapore. This defamation action is brought by the plaintiff as a result of several

letters published by the defendant to the members of the General Committee

(‘GC’) of the Club.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><b>Brief Facts</b></p>
<p align="justify">2.    Some time before the Annual General Meeting

(‘AGM’) on 25 May 1998, the defendant was canvassing for several candidates who

were standing for election to the GC. One of those candidates was his son, Mr Chew Kei

Jin. The plaintiff, a member of the outgoing GC, was offering himself for the post of

vice-president.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    As part of his campaigning, the defendant wrote

and circulated ‘A Layman’s Guide to the AGM’ (‘Layman’s

Guide’), where he expressed his feelings towards the then GC members in no uncertain

terms. It reads as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><b>A LAYMAN’S GUIDE TO THE AGM</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Fellow Members,</p>
<p align="justify">I am not a candidate for Office, nor do I belong to any

  ‘clique’ who have ganged up to get something special for themselves (or for

  their wonderful children).</p>
<p align="justify">I joined the Tanglin Club knowing full well what it was and what I

  liked most about it was that it was not like ‘other’ clubs. However we now have

  Rasmussen and his gang, who must have joined the club for much the same reasons as I did,

  suddenly turning around hell bent on making the Club like ‘other’ clubs –

  the very same clubs which we have now seen run to the ground – and the ‘down

  with the Tanglin club as we know it’ battle cry is still going on ….. but worse,

  it has now acquired a tint of racism.</p>
<p align="justify">Rasmussen and his gang have consistently made Singaporeans laughing

  stock by their churlish rabble raising "The Tanglin Club is for Singaporeans (which

  he claims to be one) because it is in Singapore and anybody who disagrees must be

  anti-Singapore". </p>
<p align="justify">Does the Chinese People’s Republic Club in Copenhagen have a

  majority of Danes? And are Danish parents clamouring for their children to have priority

  of membership?</p>
<p align="justify">Nationality has nothing to do with it, it is he and his

  Committee’s style of riding rough shod over us members that was the beginning of our

  troubles. Barely six weeks in office, the Committee tried to bulldoze a ridiculous twenty

  million dollar ($20,000,000) underground car park for 350 cars across the road. How

  irresponsible can you be? Imagine if it had gone through we would not only be broke now,

  as we are, we would be in serious financial straits … don’t forget that!</p>
<p align="justify">Following this on the same agenda was a proposal to change the

  membership rules to take in 800 Singaporean 21 year-olds immediately …… to

  ‘deliver’ to the Singaporean members to whom he had made the promise in return

  for their support of him.</p>
<p align="justify">It was not that the membership was unwilling to consider this proposal

  but the very stunt of trying to push it through right under the noses of the members whom

  they knew would be away on their traditional holidays, especially when they had been told

  beforehand not to do so by a member in writing, was enough to bring on the angry scenes

  and shouts of ‘Resign Resign!’ at the SGM that followed.</p>
<p align="justify">Anyone with one iota of self-respect would have done so, but not these

  people. Thus 98 members followed up with a petition to have the Vice-President removed

  from office failing which there would be a requisition for a SGM to censure the Committee.</p>
<p align="justify">When the petition was brought to the attention of the Committee member

  concerned for his instructions as to what to do about it, he was heard to have replied

  "Ignore it, we don’t have to do anything about it" …… very much

  the same thing expressed by another member of the Committee. "We are the committee,

  we have the power to expel those members …..we don’t have to do what we

  don’t wish to do".</p>
<p align="justify">We members had no alternative but to turn to the Courts for the right

  to be heard. At the appeal, the final stage of the long legal battle for the right of

  members to be heard, the Honourable Chief Justice said "So the Committee have

  sovereign immunity? …… Does this mean that if the Committee run the Club to the

  ground, the general Meeting can do nothing? …….. This cannot be".</p>
<p align="justify">This therefore is the first motion for discussion before the AGM

  proper.</p>
<p align="justify">Next, let’s look at our finances. In 1996 under the old

  ‘incompetent’ management we had an operating PROFIT of $1,047,000. How, after

  all the bragging big talk at the beginning of their term they report a LOSS of $1,055,000

  – this is a difference of $2,103,000 – and, if we throw in taxes and

  depreciation as well we are in fact poorer by $1,300,000. Now, how the Committee chooses

  to explain this is purely academic because it isn’t difficult for us to see how this

  has come about.</p>
<p align="justify">$400,000 is the cost of the man engaged as the General Manager to run

  our Club but who has turned out to be no more than a grossly overpaid Flunkey of the

  Committee. Add to this the $200,000 paid to ‘Consultants’ to advise us on how to

  ‘improve’ what has been described by Chefs as the ‘best equipped

  kitchen’ in Singapore. The cost of the new logo, which no one asked for nor approved

  by the members, $30,000 for the design and (say) $20,000 for the reprinting of

  letterheads, menus, etc. Then there are the Legal Fees in their futile attempts to save

  their faces (at our expense) including costs awarded to the "handful of trouble

  makers in the Tavern" (estimated) $250,000. Finally, the cost of the cigars consumed

  by the Committee at the dinner following the Appeal to help heal the wounds inflicted by

  the Honourable Chief Justice (if he only knew about this extravagance!) $465.35.</p>
<p align="justify">To this total of $900,465.35, we now add the loss of revenue from the

  Jackpot machines which some members say is due to the diminishing payouts to increase the

  profit margins (never thought of by the incompetent previous Committees) which have put

  them off.</p>
<p align="justify">Is this the Club you want? It this the Committee you want? …..

  Think carefully! ….</p>
<p align="justify">If you want them to stay on to lead the Club to further disrepute the

  following have offered their services to continue the ruin of the Club – John

  Rasmussen, C. Arul, Kenneth Chew, K.T. Chan, Patrick Garez, Vince Khoo, and Mok Yew Fun.</p>
<p align="justify">Otherwise, there are Graeme McGuire, K.P. Swee, Sidney Rolt, Andre

  Bouvron, Chew Kei Jin, Chim Hou Yan, Donald Grant, Bill Gartshore and Colin Taylor, level

  headed sensible people who are going to put things right and return us the Club we knew

  before all this acrimonious mud-slinging and racial bickering descended upon us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="right">C 642</p>
<p align="justify">4.    To identify himself as the author, the defendant

merely typed ‘C 642’, his membership number, at the left bottom of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

page of the Layman’s Guide. He did not disclose his name nor pen his signature.</p>
<p align="justify">5.    Despite what the defendant had said about the then

GC in his Layman’s Guide, five of the previous GC members were re-elected. They

included Mr Rasmussen who was re-elected the president, and the plaintiff who was elected

the new vice-president. Only six new members were voted in. On the next day after the AGM,

a member handed a copy of the Layman’s Guide to the plaintiff. The plaintiff checked

the Club’s records and found that ‘C642’ was the membership number of the

defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    The plaintiff then wrote to the defendant two

letters dated 27 May 1998 and 2 June 1998, which ignited the acrimonious matters leading

to the chain of publications allegedly defamatory of the plaintiff. As the defendant

complained that both letters were rude, I will reproduce them here:</p>
<blockquote>
<i><b><p align="justify">Letter of 27 May 1998</p></b></i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Chew,</p>
<p align="justify">Many copies of a letter written to "Fellow Members" was

    circulated at the AGM of the Tanglin Club on Monday, 25<sup>th</sup> May 1998. The title

    is "A Layman’s Guide to the AGM".</p>
<p align="justify">The letter shows the number "C 642" which is your Tanglin

    Club number. I enclose a copy of the letter, which I myself did not see at or even after

    the AGM on 25<sup>th</sup> May 1998, but which was sent to me on 26th May 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">I write to ask if you wrote that letter.</p>
<p align="justify">Kindly let me have a reply by return.</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely,<br/>

    (Signed) <br/>

    C Arul </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Letter of 2 June 1998</b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Chew,</p>
<p align="justify">You have still not replied to my simple and straightforward request in

    my letter of 27<sup>th</sup> May 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">Can you please let me have a reply without any further delay?</p>
<p align="justify">I await your reply.</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely,<br/>

    (Signed)<br/>

    C Arul</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7.    The defendant concluded that both letters were not

well-intentioned. He knew that the plaintiff was the vice-president and also the convenor

of the Membership and Rules Sub-Committee (‘M &amp; R’). He was aware of an

incident where a member who had demanded answers to awkward questions during a debate was

hauled up the next day and made to appear before the M &amp; R to answer for what was

described as ‘behaviour unbecoming of a member of the Club’.</p>
<p align="justify">8.    The defendant suspected that the plaintiff was on

a witch-hunt for members who were critical of the GC including those who had taken the

previous GC members to Court. He said that the plaintiff bore a paranoid grudge against

him and was witch-hunting him for having written the Layman’s Guide.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    When the plaintiff persisted in finding out the

authorship of the Layman’s Guide by writing the second letter, which was described by

the defendant as curt and sarcastic, it began to annoy the defendant. The defendant became

convinced that the plaintiff was out to cause him harm of some sort, the least of which

would be to suspend his membership for personal revenge. He and the plaintiff were clearly

on a collision course. He had the choice of either throwing himself at his mercy or

prepare himself for a conflict with him. The defendant admitted in his evidence that if

persons living in glass houses were to throw stones at him, he will throw stones back at

them.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    The defendant conceded having the above frame of

mind. This will be important when determining the defendant’s dominant motive

actuating his chain of publications.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    At paragraphs 37 to 38 of his affidavit of

evidence-in-chief, the defendant said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">37. It was at this point that I recalled having seen copies of the

  newspaper cutting concerning the Plaintiff which had been circulated in the Club in early

  1998 and which I had also received in the mail. …</p>
<p align="justify">38. <u>Up to then there was <b>little reason</b> for me to go into the

  newspaper report but with the Plaintiff seeking excuses to have me before him i.e. the

  Membership and Rules Sub-Committee, this put a different complexion on the matter and

  awakened me to take the matter seriously.</u> </p>
<p align="justify">39. I thought that if the Plaintiff had any intention to embark on a <u>"<b>witch-hunt</b>"

  against me, it might <b>discourage him</b> if he was reminded that he had to first make

  sure that his own hands were clean before he made any plans to mete out his brand of

  "Club justice".</u> I therefore wrote a letter dated 5<sup>th</sup> June 1998

  reproducing therein the newspaper cutting relating to the Plaintiff’s involvement in

  a Johore housewife case. … (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">12.    The plaintiff said that the defendant was being

"cheeky" when he wrote the letter of 5<sup>th</sup> June 1998, which is

reproduced below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Letter of 5 June 1998</b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Arul,</p>
<p align="justify">There are two ARUL CHANDRANS in the Telephone Book – one with his

    address at 23 Balmoral Rd, #14-23, and the other at Block 121 Yuan Chuan Rd. #10-405.</p>
<p align="justify">Are you the Arul referred to in the newspaper cutting reproduced below

    as the Singapore lawyer who was sentenced to two years jail for fraud and breach of trust

    against an housewife in Johore?</p>
<p align="justify">I ask this because if you are the other Arul, I do not intend to reply

    to his letter as I do not know him.</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p align="justify">________________________________________________________</p>
<p align="justify">CAV CHEW JP 11 Stamford Road #03-07 Capitol Building Singapore 178884</p>
</blockquote>
<b><p align="center">Newspaper Cutting Attached</p></b>:

  <p align="center"><b>Singapore lawyer among three jailed</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Johore Bahru, Sat. –</p>
<p align="justify">The High Court here today sentenced three lawyers, including a

    Singaporean, to two years jail each for contempt after passing judgment against them in a

    civil suit.</p>
<p align="justify">Mr Justice Abdul Razak bin Datuk Abu Samah allowed Datuk Joginder

    Singh, Datuk P. Suppiah and Singapore lawyer Arul Chandran to give security of $100,000

    each in two sureties pending execution of sentence after the disposal of the case.</p>
<p align="justify">The lawyers were found to have committed fraud and breach of trust

    against Madam Tara Rajaratnam over a two-hectare plot of land in Kulai, Johore, in 1975.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Unbecoming</b></p>
<p align="justify">Mr Justice Abdul Razak, who took five hours to read the 138-page

    judgment, committed the lawyers to jail for misleading and deceiving the court as well as

    trying to obstruct Madam Tara from seeking justice.</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment on damages to be awarded to Madam Tara was postponed to

    Sept 30.</p>
<p align="justify">The judge, in passing judgment, described the behaviour of the three

    men as unbecoming of lawyers in taking advantage of a defenceless housewife who had to

    raise their misdeeds from court to court and then to the Bar Council.</p>
<p align="justify">Mr Justice Abdul Razak said, of the three, Datuk Suppiah especially had

    misled the court on many important points from the Lower Court to the Federal Court and

    that the three must be punished for tarnishing the profession and the court of law.</p>
<p align="justify">Datuk Joginder Singh was present when Datuk Suppiah went to Madam

    Tara’s house to ask her to sign some papers, without informing her they were for the

    transfer of her land to them instead of as a security for her brother-in-law.</p>
<p align="justify">He said Datuk Suppiah and the two men had also misled the bank to

    release to them bank statements relating to Madam Tara’s land by stating they were

    acting for her.</p>
<p align="justify">As for Arul, the judge said he had also misled the court into believing

    he was the bona fide buyer of the land throughout the proceedings from the Lower Court to

    the Federal Court until he was challenged.</p>
<p align="justify">The judge said Arul could not now come to court to claim he was not

    involved, saying he had left the matter to Datuk Suppiah and Datuk Joginder Singh.

    –NST.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">13.    The plaintiff replied on 12 June 1998 saying that

he was ‘the very same Arul Chandran referred to in the newspaper cutting

enclosed,’ and he asked the defendant to ‘please give [him] a straight reply to

[his] question.’</p>
<p align="justify">14.    Instead of simply admitting to the authorship,

the defendant replied on 24 June 1998 in the following terms as he felt that (a) the

plaintiff had not disputed what was in the newspaper article, and (b) the contents of the

newspaper article were all the more important because the plaintiff was the vice-president

of the Club and the M &amp; R chairman, which the defendant said was the Club’s

‘in-house judge, custodian and keeper of our Club’s morality, discipline,

conduct and conscience’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Letter of 24 June 1998 </b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr C Arul</p>
<p align="justify">I was merely being meticulously careful on establishing the right

    identity to avoid offending the wrong person and I fail to understand why you took such

    exception to an address in Yuan Ching Road. I will have you know that there are many

    respectable, law abiding, honest citizens residing there – unless you now fancy

    yourself a class above these people.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, by the vexatious tone of your letter, it would seem that you

    expect the answer to my enquiry to be common knowledge. <u>Am I supposed to believe then

    that the Members who voted for you in the last elections knew of the report of your

    conviction for fraud and breach of trust against the housewife in Johore?</u></p>
<p align="justify">A reply in due course will be much appreciated.</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely,<br/>

    (Signature of defendant)<br/>

    (<b>Alleged</b> <b>defamatory words are underlined.</b>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15.    The plaintiff again wrote to ask the defendant if

he would please be kind enough to answer the simple question he had asked earlier. The

plaintiff pressed for a ‘reply by return’ and requested the defendant to stop

avoiding the question.</p>
<p align="justify">16.    The defendant, on receiving the plaintiff’s

letter dated 26 June 1998, felt that the plaintiff was out to intimidate him because the

letter was on the letterhead of his firm M/s Arul &amp; Partners. He surmised that the

plaintiff and his firm could not possibly be making persistent enquiry for an idle

purpose. It confirmed to the defendant that the plaintiff intended to do him harm.</p>
<p align="justify">17.    To prepare for battle, the defendant thought at

this point that it was important for him to know more about Arul. Basically it was to dig

up whatever he could discover about Arul’s past and throw it at him. The defendant

began to find out more about the Johore housewife’s case reported in the newspaper

cutting which he remembered seeing some 6 months earlier in January 1998. As his wife is a

lawyer, he sought his wife’s assistance and obtained the judgment of Justice Abdul

Razak, reported in the Malayan Law Journal: <i>Tara Rajaratnam v. Datuk Jagindar Singh

&amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1983] 2 MLJ 127</nobr>. His wife, Mdm Lim Leong Teen, is a senior partner in M/s

Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah. His son, Mr Chew Kei Jin, is also a lawyer and a partner in the

same firm.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    According to the defendant, what the judge had to

say about the plaintiff’s conduct weighed down heavily on him. Having read the whole

judgment including the editorial note, matters took a different complexion for him. The

defendant then wrote another letter dated 10 July 1998. The alleged defamatory words are

underlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Letter of 10 July 1998</b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr C Arul</p>
<p align="justify">According to a newspaper report, "<u>three lawyers, including a

    Singaporean, were sentenced to two year’s jail each for contempt…The lawyers

    were found to have committed fraud and breach of trust against .. a defenseless

    housewife.."</u></p>
<p align="justify">In your letter dated 12 June 1998 you said "I am the very same

    Arul Chandran referred to in the newspaper cutting…as you no doubt already

    know".</p>
<p align="justify">I then asked whether the Members who voted for you in the last

    elections were aware of this, to which your solicitors, C. Arul &amp; Partners, answered

    that it was irrelevant to the issue.</p>
<u><p align="justify">Are you saying that someone who has been called "a most vicious

    and dangerous fraud" by a High Court Judge** is now the Vice-President of the Club is

    something of no relevance to the Members? I wonder how you had the nerve to offer yourself

    for office in the first place.</p>

<p align="justify">19.    Although the defendant knew that the

plaintiff’s appeal against his summary conviction and sentence for contempt was

allowed, nevertheless he understood all this to be irrelevant to what he was going to tell

the GC. It must be noted that a number of the descriptions given to the plaintiff by Abdul

Razak J formed part of the basis for his summary conviction and sentence of imprisonment

of 2 years for contempt, which was already to the knowledge of the defendant set aside by

the Federal Court of Criminal Appeal. The defendant ignored all of that because he felt

that it was completely irrelevant to what he had to say.</p>
<p align="justify">20.    The defendant was disturbed by the

plaintiff’s dismissive attitude to his query, which he said went to the heart of the

Club’s integrity. He also felt that the plaintiff’s persistent personal query on

the authorship of the Layman’s Guide made no sense to him. In his affidavit, the

defendant affirmed in no uncertain terms that he had only two reasons for writing to the

GC. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">48. Consequently, I felt that I should find out for sure from the

  General Committee whether the Plaintiff’s pursuit of "A Layman’s Guide To

  The AGC" was under their instructions. There were <u>two reasons</u> for this.

  Firstly, I wanted to be assured that I had not contravened any Club Rules and secondly, I

  had hoped that if the Committee was not involved in the matter, <u><b>they would at least

  restrain him from doing something foolish which might have repercussions on the Club</b></u>.

  Accordingly, I wrote a letter dated 10<sup>th</sup> July 1998 to the President and General

  Committee of the Club enclosing the correspondence the Plaintiff and I had exchanged so

  far. (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">21.    The covering letter addressed to the president

and the GC, enclosing all the previous correspondence between himself and the plaintiff,

also stated very clearly the purpose of his letter to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">What I seek from the Committee is a confirmation as to whether C. Arul

  is acting in his own private capacity or is he now under instructions from you to pursue

  the matter with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">22.    It is significant that the defendant was not

asking the GC to consider whether the plaintiff was still fit to serve as the

vice-president of the GC and the chairman of the M &amp; R in view of what the learned

judge had said.</p>
<p align="justify">23.    Since the query to the GC was simply to ascertain

if Arul was acting under instructions, I ask myself the question whether it is necessary

to enclose all the other correspondence to his covering letter? I find it difficult to

comprehend why the defendant took the trouble to enclose the entire set of correspondence

when he was merely seeking to ascertain a simple fact. The covering letter itself could

simply have asked if the GC had instructed the plaintiff to write to him to find out

whether he had written the Layman’s Guide. At the most, the Layman’s Guide may

be enclosed. But I cannot see any good reason to enclose all the previous correspondence

unless it was done with some other improper motive or malice.</p>
<p align="justify">24.    Where the desired purpose has been stated in the

covering letter, I find it difficult to infer that by enclosing the 10 July 1998 letter

(addressed to the plaintiff where he asked the plaintiff personally how he had the nerve

to offer himself for office), the defendant intended to raise the issue of the

plaintiff’s suitability for office with the GC <b>at the same time</b>. If that was

in fact his intention and motivation, I would have regarded it as a proper motive coming

within a privileged occasion.</p>
<p align="justify">25.    Since the defendant had clearly expressed in the

covering letter his true intention and objective for writing to the GC members, I am not

prepared to accept his oral testimony that he had some other proper dominant motive or

purpose, which was somehow not expressed in the letter. </p>
<p align="justify">26.    Furthermore his own affidavit of

evidence-in-chief categorically stated that there were two reasons why he wrote to the GC.

First, he wanted an assurance that he had not contravened any Club Rules. Second, he hoped

that if the GC was not involved in the matter, they would at least restrain the plaintiff

from doing something foolish which might have repercussions on the Club. Thus his letter

to the GC, with all the attached enclosures, was not motivated by any legal, social or

moral duty, or legitimate interest as a Club member to inform the GC that Arul was not a

suitable person to hold office in the Club in the light of his past misdeeds. By his own

mouth, he wanted the GC members to restrain the plaintiff from pursuing the matter on the

authorship of the Layman’s Guide if the plaintiff was not acting under their

instructions. To my mind, this is the very antithesis of the kind of legitimate interest

that will give rise to an occasion of qualified privilege for publication. In fact, the

defendant’s motivation and hope was for the GC to take sides in the personal and

private dispute between him and the plaintiff, and to intervene in his favour by

restraining the plaintiff (a) from witch-hunting him, and (b) from laying a complaint to

the Club for having written the Layman’s Guide. </p>
<p align="justify">27.    If Arul was writing to the defendant in his

personal capacity, which plainly he was, to gather sufficient evidence (a) to bring an

action for civil or criminal defamation against the defendant, or (b) to lay a complaint

with the GC or the M &amp; R as an ordinary member, he will clearly be entitled to do so

if he genuinely and reasonably believed that he had been libelled in the Layman’s

Guide. It does not mean that Arul loses all his rights simply because he happens to be the

Club’s vice-president and the M &amp; R chairman. He still retains all his civil

rights as an ordinary citizen including his rights as an ordinary Club member. </p>
<p align="justify">28.    The defendant on being queried is of course

entitled not to answer the plaintiff’s queries if he was not minded to. The plaintiff

cannot compel him to answer either. But those queries do not provide a legal justification

to unleash a flood of libellous pre-emptive attacks on the plaintiff’s character and

reputation.</p>
<p align="justify">29.    Neither does it seem quite proper in my judgment

for the defendant to ask the GC to restrain or stop a member from complaining to the GC or

the M &amp; R, or from exercising his civil rights to sue for defamation, take out a

private summons or to report to the police on what he reasonably believes to be an offence

of criminal defamation committed against him. Whether the defamation action, police report

or complaint to the Club’s GC or M &amp; R is justifiable on the merits is an

entirely different issue. It is for the relevant body, tribunal or committee to determine

that at the appropriate stage after it is referred to their attention.</p>
<p align="justify">30.    What seems clear to me is that prodding the GC to

interfere in a private dispute strictly between two Club members cannot conceivably create

an occasion of qualified privilege. What is worse is that the defendant is apparently

hoping that the GC will be afraid of the embarrassment and thus restrain the defendant. If

the GC were not to do so, the defendant is threatening to wash the plaintiff’s

‘dirty linen’ in public, never mind the embarrassment it will bring to the

plaintiff and to the Club. The defendant was apparently suggesting this in his affidavit

when he said that ‘if the GC was not involved in the matter, they would at least

restrain the defendant from doing something foolish which might have repercussions on the

Club.’</p>
<p align="justify">31.    On 20 July 1998, the Club’s president wrote

to inform the defendant that the plaintiff was acting in his own private capacity and

confirmed that the GC was not involved in the matter between them. </p>
<p align="justify">32.    After receiving a copy of the letter dated 10

July 1998 addressed to the president and the GC together with all the enclosures, the

plaintiff wrote to the defendant on 23 July 1998 to tell him that what he was obviously

trying to do was to embarrass him. In this letter, the plaintiff confirmed that he was

acting in his own private capacity. The plaintiff said that the defendant’s several

letters were irrelevant to his question on the authorship of the Layman’s Guide. The

plaintiff told the defendant to reply without any further delay, and later followed up

with a reminder on 3 August 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">33.    The defendant replied to the plaintiff on the

next day stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Letter of 4 August 1998</b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr C Arul</p>
<p align="justify">You are sadly misguided if you choose to think that I am motivated by a

    desire to "embarrass" you – you know very well that there is no benefit in

    that for me. My only concern is for our Club, and what you are doing to it.</p>
<p align="justify">If the Club means as much to you as it does to the rest of us, you will

    know that, in the circumstances, there is but only one honourable thing to do – and

    that is for you to step down from the Committee of the Club.</p>
<p align="justify">If you have any sense of dignity you will not wait until you no longer

    have the choice; resign gracefully now and let the matter end here.</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely,<br/>

    (Signed by the defendant.)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">34.    I considered the above letter carefully to see if

indeed by this time, the defendant’s dominant motive had changed and was no longer to

prevent the plaintiff from witch-hunting him for the Layman’s Guide but that his only

concern was the welfare of the Club as he had purportedly stated in his letter. After

scrutinizing the evidence, I do not think that his dominant motive had changed.</p>
<p align="justify">35.    The defendant had previously seen the newspaper

cutting on Arul in early 1998. According to the defendant, this newspaper cutting had

surfaced in the Club in January 1998. He would certainly have realised its obvious

implications as the plaintiff was already holding office in the Club as a GC member. Yet,

he did not find it necessary out of a sense of duty or legitimate concern for the well

being of the Club to bring the matter up at that time. He only chose to take the matter up

after he convinced himself that the plaintiff was witch-hunting him. As can be seen, this

was at least 6 months after the newspaper cutting had surfaced in the Club. The defendant

admitted that he only decided to find out more about the newspaper cutting after he

received the plaintiff’s letters and after realizing that the plaintiff was out to do

him harm. I therefore doubt his true bona fides when he said that he was not motivated by

any desire to embarrass the plaintiff because there was <b>no benefit</b> whatsoever in

that for him. On the contrary, he himself admitted in his affidavit at paragraph 48 that

he had written to the GC with the hope that they would restrain the plaintiff from

pursuing him. Surely that was a ‘benefit’ he was hoping to get. </p>
<p align="justify">36.    In my determination of the defendant’s true

motives, I am keenly aware that a person’s dominant motive can change with time. Due

to the changing circumstances, what is otherwise a lesser motive may eventually assume

more importance and later become dominant. What was earlier the dominant motive may become

less important subsequently. Situations can be very fluid. It is wrong in my view to

conclude that once a certain motive is dominant, it always remains as that person’s

dominant motive throughout the remainder of his conduct and actions. A different state of

mind may exist at a different point of time. What is the true dominant motive at any

particular point of time is very much a question of fact. </p>
<p align="justify">37.    On the same day, 4 August 1998, the defendant

also wrote to the president of the Club questioning whether he had enquired from the

plaintiff what his motives were. He said that what the plaintiff was doing would only lead

him finally to seek the Court’s protection of his rights. </p>
<p align="justify">38.    This evidence revealed that what was still

uppermost on the defendant’s mind was the plaintiff’s pursuit of him, which he

obviously wanted to stop.</p>
<p align="justify">39.    The defendant went on in the next paragraph of

his letter to question the president if he still considered the plaintiff the best choice

over the other nine GC members to serve as the chairman and convenor of the M &amp; R, now

that he knew of the plaintiff’s ‘Curriculum Vitae’. As the plaintiff had

complained that this letter, copied to all the other GC members, was defamatory of him, I

will set out the letter in full with the alleged offending words underlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Letter of 4 August 1998 </i></b></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Rasmussen</p>
<p align="justify">Thank you for your letter of 20<sup>th</sup> July 1998 in response to

    my enquiry as to whether C Arul is harassing me on the instructions of the Committee or in

    his own private capacity.</p>
<p align="justify">Now that we know he is not on Club business has it occurred to you to

    enquire from him what his personal motives are? What Arul is doing will only lead me

    finally to seek the Courts for the protection of my rights and that will take us back to

    where we were four months ago – just when we were led to believe that all that was

    now behind us.</p>
<u><p align="justify">You can be given the benefit of the doubt that at the time when you

    appointed him Chairman &amp; Convenor of the Rules and Membership Committee you were

    unaware of his Curriculum Vitae but then, now with the knowledge that you have, do you

    still consider him the best choice over the nine other members of the Committee to serve

    in that position?</p>
<p align="justify">Would you say that leaving us 5,000 members at the mercy of who a High

    Court Judge described as "a most vicious and dangerous fraud" to administer Club

    Justice is your way of keeping faith with the Membership who elected you President?</p></u>

<p align="justify">CAV CHEW "Stamford Road #03-07, Capitol Building Singapore

    178884"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">40.    Given the background events leading to this

letter, I have no doubt that the predominant motive of the defendant was still to throw as

much mud at the plaintiff as he could lay his hands on, because he believed that the

plaintiff was harassing him and was lining him up to be disciplined by the Club’s

disciplinary committee. The defendant said that if the plaintiff intended to lay his hands

on him, then he ought to make sure that his own hands were clean in the first place. So

the main motive was more of a revengeful mudslinging to show up the unsavoury past of

Arul. The end result the defendant hoped for was the termination of the plaintiff’s

harassment of him. He clearly admitted that his letter of 4 August 1998 was to ask the GC

to restrain the plaintiff. That was his objective.</p>
<p align="justify">41.    The issue of the fitness of the plaintiff to hold

office was thus a convenient cover from which to throw mud continuously at the plaintiff

to achieve his own personal objectives. If the predominant motive at this time was truly

and simply to highlight the unsuitability of the plaintiff to hold office as a result of

what the learned judge had said, then I cannot understand why it is that the barrage of

mud throwing had continued relentlessly as can be seen by the later conduct of the

defendant. It is all too obvious that it had turned into a personal crusade by the

defendant, who was now persecuting and attacking the plaintiff with a vengeance, far

exceeding what I would expect of a person who has no spite or ill-will against Arul but

who simply has the interest and welfare of the Club at heart i.e. simply to highlight for

the fair consideration by the GC Arul’s suitability or lack thereof to hold office in

view of the findings of the Malaysian High Court Judge. </p>
<p align="justify">42.    The language of this letter and those that

followed, and the sheer determination with which the defendant was acting throughout the

dispute, demonstrated convincingly to me that he was personally bent on seeing the

plaintiff removed from the Club totally and not merely removed as an office holder on

account of what the Malaysian High Court Judge had said of him. I do not infer this

lightly but after much due consideration. I have to pierce through the camouflage of

reasons offered by the defendant in his own defence to uncover the real underlying

reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">43.    On the next day, 5 August 1998, the plaintiff

promptly replied to the defendant’s personal letter to him dated 4 August 1998,

stating that he was hurt by his letter, but he would keep his cool and ‘ask for the 7<sup>th</sup>

time since 27 May 1998, the same, simple question: Did you Mr Chew write the circular

letter titled "A Layman’s Guide to the AGC" which was circulated at the

Tanglin Club AGM on the 25 May 1998.’ The plaintiff kept up the pressure on the

defendant with his request (emphasised by underlining and in bold) and put in this manner:

‘The question is as simple as it is straightforward, and requires a direct answer,

"yes" or "no". Will you <u><b>please</b></u> answer that question

now?’ </p>
<p align="justify">44.    I think that this 7<sup>th</sup>

‘request’ in this form not only annoyed the defendant further, it must have made

an angry man even angrier. </p>
<p align="justify">45.    The plaintiff wrote another letter dated the 6

August 1998. This time it was in reply to the letter of 4 August 1998, which the defendant

had written to the president and copied to all the GC members. The plaintiff in turn

copied his reply to the president and the GC members. Clearly, the plaintiff was writing

in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the president or the GC. It cannot be

reasonably construed otherwise. </p>
<p align="justify">46.    To my mind, it is a fair and measured response

from the plaintiff. I note that the plaintiff said that he was hurt by the reference to

him as a ‘most vicious and dangerous fraud’. That he was indeed hurt cannot be

doubted. For completeness, I shall set out the plaintiff’s letter of 6 August 1998 in

full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Chew,</p>
<p>LETTER TO PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON 4.8.98</p>
<p align="justify">You have sent me a copy of your letter to Mr J. Rasmussen dated 4

  August, the President of the Tanglin Club.</p>
<p align="justify">Firstly you say that I am "harassing" you because I have

  asked you one simple and straightforward question, to which you are yet to give me a

  reply.</p>
<p align="justify">I cannot agree that the posing of such a question can amount to

  "harassment", if one understands the meaning of that word. The test, I believe

  is objective and not subjective.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, you say that what I am doing "will only lead you finally

  to seek the courts for the protection of your rights". I contend that the posing of

  my question, in the light of your initials and club number appearing on the document in

  question, cannot in any way be said to be in breach of any of your rights, either as a

  member of the Tanglin Club, or as a citizen of Singapore. In my view a reasonable person

  may be entitled to conclude that it was written by you and those circumstances I thought

  it only fair that you ought to be given the opportunity of confirming or denying it. So

  far, you have not done so. If you feel that I have in fact violated your rights, then I

  invite you to do what you have just threatened, to seek the protection of the Courts, and

  without any delay.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, you wrote to the President of the Club that I ought not to

  have been appointed the Chairman of the Membership and Rules sub committee because of my

  "curriculum vitae". I invite you to set out what you allege is my

  "curriculum vitae" that makes me less of a fit person to chair the M&amp;R sub

  committee. Will you let me have that by return?</p>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, you have made a reference to a High Court Judge (you do not

  say in which country) who has described me as a "most vicious and dangerous

  fraud", a reference which is hurtful, considering the circumstances of that case.</p>
<p align="justify">I have taken note of what you have written, will you now reply to the

  third point in this letter, by return?</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely,<br/>

  (Signed)<br/>

  C Arul</p>
<p align="justify">c.c. President &amp; GC members</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">47.    Because the plaintiff stated that the defendant

had not made clear which country the High Court Judge was from, the defendant concluded

that the plaintiff was implying that he did not know who the judge was. He believed that

this was frivolous and calculated to vex him. I am fairly certain that the defendant was

indeed vexed. An overly sensitive person can create conditions in his own mind, read more

things into matters than one less sensitive would, and then get himself worked up

unnecessarily. Thereafter, he may retaliate out of some self-generated outrage, which

might well be uncalled for.</p>
<p align="justify">48.    Continuing with the acrimonious correspondence, I

believe that the defendant was waiting for some response from the president of the Club to

his letter. When there was no response, the clearly infuriated defendant reminded the

president that he personally owed him an answer. He wrote to the president a letter dated

18 August 1998, which was copied to all the GC members. One can sense the simmering anger

in the defendant (which now extended to the president) from the tone and manner of the

letter, which I will now set out in full, again with alleged the offending words

underlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Letter of 18 August 1998</b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Rasmussen,</p>
<p align="justify">There is a letter I wrote to you dated 4<sup>th</sup> August which

    remains unanswered and unacknowledged.</p>
<p align="justify">The letter refers to the appointment of C Arul as the Chairman and

    Convenor of the Rules and Membership Committee and questioning why is he still there in

    spite of what we now know of him.</p>
<p align="justify">The question I put to you was <u>whether leaving us 5000 Members at the

    mercy of a man who has been called by a High Court Judge "a Liar"…"a

    wolf in lambs clothing"…"a Chameleon", ….in short…."a

    most vicious and dangerous fraud" to administer Club Justice</u>, your way of keeping

    faith with the Members who elected you President?</p>
<p align="justify">Please do not hand it down to Arul to answer; we are not interested in

    what he has to say for himself. Let us hear it from you this one time.</p>
<p align="justify">Yours sincerely<br/>

<p align="justify">c.c. The Committee</p>
<p align="justify">CAV CHEW 11 Stamford Road #03-07 Capitol Building Singapore 178884</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">49.    I am not able to see how the defendant concluded

that the president was not replying because he had in fact handed the correspondence to

the plaintiff to reply in his personal capacity. Perhaps, rationality is suppressed when a

person is angry. The defendant said that he was disturbed that the important issue he

placed before the Club through the president was being handed to the plaintiff to answer,

with the result that the plaintiff was becoming the scribe of the Club, and a judge in his

own cause. He felt that there was ‘collusion’ between the president and the

plaintiff, and therefore, he had to point out in his ‘strongly worded letter’

that the president ‘had broken faith with the membership to entrust the discipline of

5000 members at the mercy of the plaintiff who was of such character as the Malaysian High

Court had described him to be.’ He even said that the GC was bent on protecting the

plaintiff and they did not even have the courtesy to reply to him. I am puzzled how he

could conclude that the entire GC was bent on protecting the plaintiff when this GC had 6

new members, some of whom were members that the defendant himself had canvassed to be

elected.</p>
<p align="justify">50.    The defendant separately wrote to the plaintiff

on the same day, 18 August 1998, quoting more of Justice Abdul Razak’s findings

against the plaintiff. As this letter was attached to the 18 August 1998 letter addressed

to and circulated to the GC members, the plaintiff complained that this letter was also

defamatory of him. I will now set it out, with the words complained of underlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Letter of 18 August 1998</b></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Mr Arul,</p>
<p align="justify">I can hardly believe after all the correspondence that has been

    exchanged between us you now ask me to "<u>set out what I allege is (your)

    ‘curriculum vitae’ that makes (you) less of a fit person to chair the M &amp; R

    sub committee</u>".</p>
<p align="justify">Where do you want me to begin – shall I go back to square one and

    ask "<u>are you the Arul referred to in the newspaper cutting ..the Singapore Lawyer

    who was sentenced to two years jail.. for contempt…together with two other lawyers

    found to have committed fraud and breach of trust against … a defenseless

    housewife"</u>?</p>
<p align="justify">And shall I go on to quote the Judge ** "<u>is he really now

    saying he is at last a lamb and not a wolf under the lamb’s wool. To me that he is

    not a lamb but a fraud. He is a most vicious and dangerous fraud…" </u></p>
<p align="justify">And to be described by the same High Court Judge ** who heard the

    Appeal as "<u>an imposter", "plainly dishonest", "a liar"

    and "a chameleon changing his colour as suits him"…what else do you want me

    to add to your curriculum vitae? I could go on for another three pages…</u></p>
<p align="justify">And you say that it is only my subjective opinion that <u>you are

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">51.    The defendant attached extracts of the written

judgment of Abdul Razak J not because he wanted to disclose what was stated in the short

editorial note to the judgment: that the plaintiff’s appeal against conviction and

sentence for contempt of court was allowed and that the plaintiff had obtained leave to

appeal to the Privy Council on the main findings of the trial judge. I am inclined to

think that the extracts were attached to prove to the other GC members that he had

accurately quoted what the learned judge had said of the plaintiff. As for the plaintiff,

the defendant intended to ‘refresh [his] frail memory’ of what the judge had

said of him. Clearly, it was not done out of benevolence to allow the plaintiff the

convenience of checking if what he quoted was correct, but to inflict painful reminders of

the long buried past on the plaintiff. </p>
<p align="justify">52.    On 21 August 1998, the plaintiff’s

solicitors wrote to the defendant demanding a withdrawal and an apology for the alleged

defamatory remarks, including a suitable sum as damages and costs. From the

defendant’s reply dated 27 August 1998, one can further gather what was his state of

mind at that time and whether his view of matters had changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">….Obviously your client ….is pursuing <u>an old grudge</u> in

  a <u>new spree of Witch-hunting</u> in wanting me to admit to a letter criticising the

  previous Committee which was distributed during the past elections.</p>
<p align="justify">His manner has caused me a <u>great deal of annoyance</u> both in his

  tone of enquiry and persistence to the point of <u>harassmen</u>t. In quoting what was

  said of him by the Bench I hoped <u>to remind him of what he desperately wants to forget</u>

  – that if he has any ideas of <u>revenge</u> by administering his brand of justice, <u>he

  had better not forget that his hands are not snow white clean</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">….. I cannot allow him to bait me for his own amusement. He

  started all this and<u> it is for him to put an end to it</u>. Otherwise, <u>if he wants a

  long struggle through the Courts</u> and end up where we did the last time, <u>so be it</u>.

  The Chief Justice will be pleased to see him. (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">53.    So it appears that if the plaintiff were to

pursue the matter of the authorship of the Layman’s Guide, the defendant would be

steadfast in continuing with his mudslinging. If the plaintiff stopped it, he would stop

but not otherwise. An eye for an eye it would seem and the defendant was preparing himself

for a long battle to the bitter end. The issue of suitability for office did not feature

much. It was more a mere facade. </p>
<p align="justify">54.    Whilst waiting to see what the plaintiff was

going to do next and whether the GC would act basically to stop the plaintiff, the

defendant realized that the original finding of fraud by Justice Abdul Razak as well as

the sentence of 2 years jail for contempt of Court brought the plaintiff within the

operation of Rule 24 of the Club’s Rules. Rule 24 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If any Member shall be convicted of any grave or heinous offence or

  adjudged bankrupt or make any composition or arrangement with his creditors he shall <i>ipso

  facto</i> cease to be a Member, provided always that notwithstanding anything contained in

  these Rules the Committee may in its absolute discretion re-admit such former Member to

  the class of membership to which he previously belonged upon such terms and conditions as

  it thinks proper, without entrance fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">55.    The defendant therefore wrote a letter dated 18

September 1998 to the president and the GC explaining his contention that the plaintiff

had ceased automatically to be a member of the club with effect from 1982 by the very fact

of the findings of fraud and sentence for contempt, and he remains so until he is

re-admitted although the plaintiff had succeeded in his appeals. He said that an

interpretation of Rule 24 should be sought from the courts by the GC. </p>
<p align="justify">56.    On 13 October 1998, the general manager of the

Club, Mr Mark Kissner, replied that his letter was tabled at the GC meeting on 12 October

1998 and the meeting did not agree with its contents. At this time, the GC had not

obtained legal advice yet.</p>
<p align="justify">57.    The defendant was dissatisfied with the reply. It

is my finding that the defendant fervently wanted the plaintiff to be kicked out of the

membership. The dispute between them had by this time no doubt become very bitter and

personal, bearing in mind that a letter of demand from the plaintiff’s solicitors had

already been issued to the defendant. He felt that the GC was protecting one of their own

at the expense of the Club’s interest. He said he was left with no choice but to seek

his fellow members’ stand on whether they wanted the GC to seek a definitive

interpretation of Rule 24 from the courts. This he did by preparing and circulating a

"A Member’s Message" on 10 November 1998 to the Club members.</p>
<p align="justify">58.    In the message, he highlighted, <i>inter alia</i>,

the newspaper clipping with the headlines "S’pore lawyer among three

jailed", who was none other than the plaintiff. He stated that the plaintiff was

found guilty of fraud and sentenced to two years’ jail for contempt of court. Thus,

the plaintiff <i>ipso facto</i> ceased to be a member according to Rule 24. He repeated

and emphasized in bold lettering what Abdul Razak J had called the plaintiff. He accused

the president of moving in tandem with ‘this most vicious and dangerous fraud’.

In the body of the member’s message, the defendant never mentioned that the

plaintiff’s appeal against the summary conviction and sentence for contempt of court

was allowed. Neither was it stated that his appeal to the Privy Council had been allowed

albeit by consent ‘upon terms that all allegations of fraud against [Arul] were

withdrawn, and also any claim against him as allegedly a constructive trustee’. The

outcomes of these appeals were material facts known to the defendant at that time, but he

chose not to fully disclose them in the body of the Member’s Message sent out to the

‘general membership.’ </p>
<p align="justify">59.    He attached the newspaper cutting and selected

extracts of the judgment of Abdul Razak J. I observe that the defendant had taken the

trouble to box up and underline many passages in the extracts of that judgment. He

deliberately focused the reader on the words ‘fraud’, ‘most vicious and

dangerous fraud’ and ‘imprisonment’, which words were double underlined.

For greater emphasis, he added two vertical lines against the underlined words ‘the

whole of Singapore, let alone the legal fraternity, would descend upon him with accusing

fingers pointing at his integrity and honesty’. A substantial part of the passages

underlined were areas where the learned judge, in finding that the plaintiff committed

contempt, had severely criticized the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">60.    But it must be noted that the Federal Court of

Criminal Appeal had already allowed the appeal by Singh, Suppiah and Arul, and set aside

the order of contempt on the grounds (a) of the learned judge’s failure to make plain

to them the specific nature of the charges and to give them the opportunity of a fair

hearing to answer them, and (b) that the learned judge had wrongly applied the principle

enunciated in <i>Coward v Stapleton </i>(1953) 90 C.L.R. 573 when he held that the

appellants were guilty of contempt and hence his conclusion was not justified. </p>
<p align="justify">61.    Defence counsel submitted strenuously that there

is a right vertical line running down the editorial note at p 128 of the judgment, which

mentions in small print that the respondents’ appeal against the conviction and

sentence was allowed and that leave to appeal to the Privy Council on the main findings of

Abdul Razak J was obtained. Was this intended by the defendant to draw the reader’s

attention to (a) the successful outcome of the plaintiff’s appeal, and (b) the leave

given to appeal to the Privy Council? I do not think so because the vertical line also ran

across parts of the headnotes which are clearly irrelevant and immaterial e.g. the list of

authorities cited in the judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">62.    If indeed the defendant wanted to similarly

highlight the quashing of the 2 years jail sentence, he could have easily boxed up the

editorial note in the same manner as he had done with headnotes (4) and (6) which states

(a) that ‘<i>the defendants were guilty of fraud</i>’, (b) that they had ‘<i>committed

a grave and abominable act of contempt against the courts as they had made the courts the

subject of their deception and mischief and they should be punished for it</i>,’ and

(c) that they ‘<i>must be committed to prison for a period of 2 years</i>.’ Why

box up this part of the headnote which dealt with the ‘grave and abominable act of

contempt’, their ‘deception and mischief’ and the sentence of 2 years,

since these are no longer relevant upon the setting aside of the order of contempt by the

appellate court? Why had he also underlined parts of the judgment containing scathing

remarks of the plaintiff, which were specific to the learned judge’s findings of

contempt, but which had been overturned by the Federal Court of Criminal Appeal? </p>
<p align="justify">63.    His failure to mention the favourable outcomes

(already known to him) of the plaintiff’s appeals in the main text of the

member’s message, and the manner in which the defendant highlighted the various

passages that were highly critical of the plaintiff in the judgment in complete disregard

of the outcomes of the appeals, corroborated the other evidence that I have set out

earlier of the defendant’s malicious motives and intentions. </p>
<p align="justify">64.    The explanation given by the defendant for not

bringing the readers’ attention to the two appeals was that those outcomes were

irrelevant to the operation of the <i>ipso facto</i> rule. If indeed the defendant was so

economical with emphasizing only what was relevant, then I cannot understand the necessity

for the substantial emphasis given to all the learned judge’s severe criticisms of

the plaintiff when the issue is merely one of interpreting the <i>ipso facto</i> rule.</p>
<p align="justify">65.    In my mind, the member’s message was

deliberately written in a fashion to further embarrass the plaintiff. The circulation is

widened considerably beyond the 10 GC members. It was calculated to spread the defamatory

material to more people so that even greater damage to the plaintiff’s reputation and

character could be achieved. These acts supported the inference of malice.</p>
<p align="justify">66.    I can also discern the defendant’s

relentless pursuit of his goal to kick the plaintiff out of the club if he could, in

revenge for the plaintiff’s ‘witch-hunt’. Moreover with the selective

emphasis to achieve the effect he wanted, he would have misled the ordinary reader to

think that the plaintiff had indeed been finally convicted of fraud and sentenced to 2

years imprisonment for contempt. An ordinary reader would obviously pay much more

attention to the main body of the members’ message and the parts of the judgment

given emphasis, than on other parts not emphasized or not given the same degree of

emphasis.</p>
<p align="justify">67.    The defendant further enclosed in his

member’s message, a self-addressed stamped envelop, and a response slip for members

to sign as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I share the Member’s view that in the light of what we now know of Arul Chandran

  the Committee must act as they are required to under the Rules of the Club and appraise

  Members of what course of action they choose to follow.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, Arul Chandran must not continue as the Chairman and Convenor of the

  Rules and Membership Sub-Committee and his position as Vice-President is no longer valid

  as he is not even a Member of the Club.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the President and the Committee will be called to answer for all of

  Arul Chandran’s actions - including his continued trespass and enjoyment of the

  privileges of the Club.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>________________<br/>

              Signed</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">68.    Initially, the defendant gave the impression that

he sent the ‘survey’ to the entire Club membership or at least a substantial

number of the members. His letter to the president and the GC dated 16 November 1998

stated that his member’s message had gone out to the ‘General Membership.’

Later it transpired that he did not circulate to all the Club members but only to about

100 members, comprising his children, his friends, acquaintances or references from his

friends. He even went on to say that one cannot expect him to go to his ‘enemies for

these things’. The defendant received 51 signed returns. Does this mean that the

other half disagreed or were simply not interested? Besides restricting the

‘survey’ to the limited circle of his friends and their friends, the

‘survey’ was drafted in a way which did not give the opportunity for persons to

register their disagreement. It was rather one-sided. Since the outcomes of the two

appeals have not been disclosed, the member’s message is likely to mislead those

ordinary Club members, who have no background information. </p>
<p align="justify">69.    In the circumstances, I conclude that the

exercise was not to get an independent and impartial response based on material facts

fairly disclosed from a substantial and broad cross-section of the membership but it was

to further embarrass and ridicule the plaintiff, and to obtain more ammunition to pressure

the GC to remove the plaintiff from the Club’s membership, which was what he

personally wanted because of his intense spite and ill-will towards the plaintiff. This

‘survey’ was also in part to retaliate against the GC for not agreeing with his

own views on Rule 24 and for taking no action on his letter. He admitted being frustrated

when the GC ‘slammed the door in [his] face.’</p>
<p align="justify">70.    From the totality of the evidence, I do not

believe that the defendant’s predominant motive in sending out the member’s

message with all the attachments and the kind of emphasis given, was not to further

embarrass the plaintiff. </p>
<p align="justify">71.    Subsequently, the defendant received a letter

dated 10 November 1998 from the general manager informing him that their lawyers, M/s Drew

&amp; Napier, had given an unequivocal opinion that his contention was incorrect and not

supported in law. Hence, the Club would not be taking any further action on his letter.

The defendant’s replied and reiterated that the GC should seek an authoritative

interpretation from the courts.</p>
<p align="justify">72.    Sometime after 16 November 1998, the defendant

followed up with another circular ‘A STEP BY STEP RATIONALE OF RULE 24 FOR THOSE WHO

ONLY HEARD OF IT FOR THE FIRST TIME…. ’. This is the first time that the

plaintiff made clear to the Club members that the plaintiff’s appeal against the

sentence for contempt was allowed, and his appeal to the Privy Council was allowed

‘by consent and on terms agreed.’ Nevertheless, the embarrassment and hurt that

he intended to inflict on the plaintiff had already been inflicted. </p>
<p align="justify">73.    The defendant cited two events in 1999 to show

that the plaintiff was unfit for office in the Club. They were the sacking of the

plaintiff from the GC on 31 March 1999 for having conducted himself in a matter unbecoming

of a member of the GC or the Club, and the ruling by the District Court on 30 September

1999 that the M &amp; R (of which the plaintiff was the chairman) had breached the rules

of natural justice when they suspended Mr Petrie. As the outcome of these later events

could not possibly have influenced the earlier actions of the defendant in publishing the

offending publications in 1998, I have to disregard them when determining if the defendant

was predominantly motivated at the time of publication by malice, or by his genuine

interest in welfare and well being of the club and his sense of duty, which is the stand

taken by the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">74.    If the evidence is merely to show that the

plaintiff is <i>per se</i> unfit to hold office in the Club, then the plaintiff’s

evidence in rebuttal is that he had in fact been vindicated in his High Court suit against

the 6 GC members who voted to sack him from the GC. Arul also testified on the past

practice adopted by the M &amp; R and how he had improved its disciplinary procedures

after he became its chairman. I believe that he did try to improve the disciplinary

procedures the way he thought best by introducing some note taking of the evidence given

at disciplinary committee proceedings and by allowing lawyers to accompany members

appearing before the disciplinary committee, which was prohibited previously. If the

plaintiff had abided by the long established disciplinary procedures in place even before

he became the M &amp; R chairman, it does not follow that he is dishonest even if those

procedures could be said to be less than fair.</p>
<p align="justify">75.    In any event, I do not think that there is

evidence that Arul had conducted himself as the M &amp; R chairman in a manner which shows

up a serious flaw in his character, leaving aside the allegation that he is a dishonest

man or a most vicious and dangerous fraud. Breaching the rules of natural justice, perhaps

inadvertently, during Mr Petrie’s hearing by allowing different members to sit on the

panel on different occasions due to expediency or convenience (as some of the panel

members were unavailable on various dates) is insufficient in my view to prove that Arul

had deliberately and intentionally done that to penalize or prejudice Mr Petrie such that

it amounts to a serious character defect on Arul’s part.</p>
<p align="justify">76.    In the course of the trial, it was discovered

that a legal opinion (P5) dated 7 January 1998 from M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill addressed to

the plaintiff was not circulated to the GC for them to consider whether the 3 resolutions

proposed by some members must be tabled at a forthcoming SGM. The 1<sup>st</sup>

resolution was a motion to censure Mr David Gabriel for ventilating certain issues of the

club in his two letters to the press. The 2<sup>nd</sup> resolution was to remove him from

the GC and all sub-committees. The 3<sup>rd</sup> resolution was to censure the GC. M/s

Allen &amp; Gledhill advised that the SGM has no power to remove a GC member and hence,

the 2<sup>nd</sup> resolution need not be tabled. But the members have the right to

requisition an SGM and the GC is bound to table the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

resolutions. </p>
<p align="justify">77.    It was also put to the plaintiff that another

earlier legal opinion (P4) from M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill dated 3 October 1997 addressed to

the Club’s president, advising that all resolutions requisitioned by the necessary

number of members must be tabled, was concealed by him and the president. The plaintiff

denied it. He agreed that he did not give a copy of it to the general manager for

circulation to the rest of the GC but he would not know if the president himself did. In

any case, he believed that the GC had discussed it although he could not explain why there

was no mention of P4 in any of the minutes of the GC meetings. Mr Vince Khoo, a GC member

called by the plaintiff to testify on his behalf, recalled seeing replies from lawyers and

one of which was from Mr Michael Hwang. This supports the plaintiff’s belief that P4

was discussed by the GC. On the other hand, the defendant called no evidence to prove his

bare assertion that the president and the plaintiff had colluded to keep that legal

opinion away from the rest of the GC. </p>
<p align="justify">78.    In trying to justify with more recent evidence

that the plaintiff is a fraud and hence, he is unfit for office (in contradistinction to

merely justifying that he is unfit for office <i>per se</i>), defendant’s counsel

submitted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) the plaintiff dishonestly concealed from the GC, a legal opinion (P5) which he

  obtained from M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill advising that they were obliged to table the 3

  resolutions;</p>
<p>(b) that the committee had not followed the advice of 3 law firms that they were

  obliged to table the 3 resolutions;</p>
<p>(c) that some of the opinions were not disclosed in subsequent court proceedings;</p>
<p>(d) that the plaintiff misrepresented the effect of M/s Chor Pee’s opinion to the

  GC, where he played a crucial role during the deliberations because the GC deferred to his

  opinions on matters relating to the law; and</p>
<p>(e) that the plaintiff misrepresented the reason for not proceeding with the 3

  resolutions in the notice sent out to the membership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">79.    The plaintiff testified that the special GC

meeting of 22 December 1997 had considered the legal opinion from M/s Chor Pee &amp;

Partners dated 17 December 1997 stating that the requisitionists were entitled to put the

3 resolutions on the agenda of the SGM but the SGM was not entitled to pass any of the 3

resolutions. After much discussion, all 7 GC members present unanimously resolved that the

3 resolutions would not be tabled at the SGM on 11 January 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">80.    From the minutes recorded, I cannot find any

evidence that the plaintiff had steered the discussion to a view that he did not honestly

hold. The plaintiff gave a reasonable explanation why he held a different view from Chor

Pee’s. Just as any other GC member, he is entitled to state his own views before the

GC so long as they are his honest views, even though those views do not accord with the

legal opinions given. I observe that the 3 resolutions have nothing to do with the

plaintiff personally. I do not see any benefit for him to conduct himself dishonestly or

to conceal P4 for that matter when the opinion given in P4 is in any case not much

different from Chor Pee’s opinion, which the GC had already discussed. In any event,

I am inclined to believe that P4 was disclosed based on the evidence of Mr Vince Khoo. </p>
<p align="justify">81.    A supplementary notice was sent out by the

general manager after the plaintiff had vetted it. It stated that the GC unanimously

decided that the 3 proposed resolutions relating to the removal of a committee member

would be ultra vires the Rules and accordingly, the 3 items would be deleted from the

agenda. I am not able to conclude that this notice had misrepresented the substance of the

decision of the GC or the reasons for it.</p>
<p align="justify">82.    As the plaintiff was going to face the SGM on 11

January 1998 to explain the GC’s views and answer questions on why those 3

resolutions were not tabled, Arul decided to seek another legal opinion on an urgent

basis. On his own initiative, he consulted Mr Michael Hwang of M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill.

Mr Hwang replied to him on 7 January 1998 stating that the 2<sup>nd</sup> resolution

should not be put to the meeting but the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> resolutions

must be put. After considering the advice, the plaintiff’s opinion did not change. So

the plaintiff proceeded to face the SGM. He did not circulate Mr Hwang’s advice to

the GC members for them to re-consider their decision. Given the short time left, I will

not fault the plaintiff for not calling another GC meeting just to discuss this latest

opinion before the SGM, which was again not much different from Chor Pee’s opinion

considered by the GC previously. Under the circumstances, I am not able to infer any

dishonest intent from the mere failure of the plaintiff to disclose this legal advice.

Even if one were to consider that the plaintiff made an error of judgment for not

circulating Mr Hwang’s advice to the GC for re-consideration, that error of judgment

does not amount to dishonesty without more.</p>
<p align="justify">83.    In any case, I note that these recent events are

not found in any of the particulars of pleading justifying why the plaintiff is unfit to

hold office. Strictly then, the defendant cannot now rely on them for this purpose. As I

understand it, the particulars on Arul’s unsuitability for office are premised

exclusively on his conduct in relation to the Tara matter, and his concealment of it from

the Club members.</p>
<p align="justify">84.    Nevertheless, I do give the defendant some leeway

in respect of P5, a document not provided in discovery to the defendant, and which came to

light only at the trial. However, if the defendant intends to use other more recent events

to justify that the plaintiff to this day must still be regarded as a ‘most vicious

and dangerous fraud’, then particulars must be clearly given in the pleadings if

those events are already known to him. Otherwise, he must be precluded from relying on

them in his justification defence as he is bound by his pleadings. I might add that in the

course of the trial, I confirmed with defendant’s counsel whether they were going to

rely on any more recent conduct to establish that the plaintiff is dishonest and a most

vicious and dangerous fraud, and hence unfit to hold office in the Club. Counsel informed

me that they were relying solely on the plaintiff’s past conduct in the Johore matter

to establish that. Basically, the defendant decided to stand by his pleadings.</p>

<p>Statement of Claim<i></i></p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> publication of 10 July 1998</p>
<p align="justify">85.    The plaintiff averred in his statement of claim

that the defendant had, by way of a covering letter dated 10 July 1998 enclosing <i>inter

alia</i> two letters (dated 24 June 1998 and 10 July 1998), falsely and maliciously

published to the president and the GC members certain words (underlined in the two letters

in italics as set out above), which were defamatory of his character, and gravely injured

his credit, character, reputation and feelings. For convenience, this is referred to as

the 1<sup>st</sup> publication.</p>
<p align="justify">86.    The plaintiff averred in paragraph 6 of his

statement of claim that the defamatory words in the context in which they were published

ordinarily meant and were understood to mean that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6a) the plaintiff had been convicted and remains convicted for fraud and criminal

  breach of trust;</p>
<p>b) the plaintiff has been found to have committed fraud and criminal breach of trust

  against a housewife in Johore;</p>
<p align="justify">c) the plaintiff is a vicious and dangerous fraud who is not fit to

  hold the position of vice-president of the Club;</p>
<p align="justify">d) the plaintiff ought not to have stood for election for the post of

  vice-president (or committee member) of the Club as he is a vicious and dangerous fraud;</p>
<p align="justify">e) the plaintiff was keeping members of the Club in the dark about his

  conviction by not informing them of the same which is unsavoury; and the plaintiff is not

  fit to sit with other committee members in the Club’s GC.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> publication of 4 August 1998</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">87.    The letter dated 4 August 1998 addressed to Mr J

Rasmussen (‘Rasmussen’), the president of the Club, and circulated to the

members of the GC, comprises the 2<sup>nd</sup> publication. The plaintiff averred in

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">93.    Extensive particulars were given under each

defence and it will be useful to set them out.</p>
<i><b>
<p>Justification</p></b></i>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Particulars were:</p>
<p align="justify">In 1974 Tara Rajaratnam (‘Rajaratnam’), a Johore housewife,

  entered into an agreement with Data P. Suppiah (‘Suppiah’), a Malaysian advocate

  and solicitor, whereby she agreed to transfer land owned by her at Kulai in Malaysia as

  security for an advance of M$220,000. Suppiah and Datuk Jagindar Singh

  (‘Singh’), who were both advocates and solicitors and partners in the firm of <i>Suppiah

  &amp; Singh,</i> acted for Rajaratnam in preparing the necessary documents. On 30 March

  1974 the Transfer and Memorandum in favour of Suppiah were signed.</p>
<p align="justify">Suppiah and Singh fraudulently induced Rajaratnam to enter into the

  said agreement by falsely and unknowingly representing to her that the transaction

  concluded on 30 March 1974 was of the nature of a security that would enable her to redeem

  the property by repaying the sum of M$220,000 at any time, when the truth was that Suppiah

  and Singh treated the transaction as an outright sale coupled with an option to

  re-purchase the property for that sum within one year of the agreement. Furthermore,

  Suppiah and Singh falsely and knowingly represented to Rajaratnam that it was their

  intention to treat the transaction as a secured loan, when in fact they had no intention

  of allowing Rajaratnam to redeem the property at any time. By making the said

  representations Suppiah and Singh induced Rajaratnam into entering into the transaction.</p>
<p align="justify">On 22 July 1975 the transfer of the land to Suppiah was registered.

  Nine days later, on 31 July, Singh executed a transfer of the land to the Plaintiff,

  purported for a sum of M$220,000. In fact, the Plaintiff never paid and never intended to

  pay this amount or any amount as consideration for the transfer.</p>
<p align="justify">On 28 January 1976 the Plaintiff applied to the relevant authorities in

  Malaysia for sub-division of the land with a view to development. On 4 March 1976, <i>Suppiah

  &amp; Singh, </i>acting on the Plaintiff’s behalf, gave Rajaratnam notice to quit the

  land. This was followed by an action for possession in which judgment was given in the

  Plaintiff’s favour on 9 August 1976. In January 1977 the Plaintiff’s application

  for sub-division was approved. In May 1978 he transferred the land to Jet Age Construction

  Co., a company which he knew to be controlled by Singh. The transaction falsely purported

  to be for a price of M$361,114. This amount was never paid, nor did the Plaintiff, Singh

  or Jet Age ever intend that this amount or any amount should ever be paid as consideration

  for the transfer. The Plaintiff, together with Suppiah and Singh, fraudulently, entered

  the said transfer in order to make it appear that the Plaintiff was a <i>bona fide</i>

  purchaser for value of the land without notice, in which event his title could not be

  attacked. The making of the said transfer was fraudulent in that the Plaintiff, Suppiah

  and Singh all knew that although the Plaintiff purported to be the registered owner of the

  land, he was in fact merely holding it as nominee or trustee for Singh. By entering into

  the said transaction the Plaintiff fraudulently conspired with Suppiah and Singh to ensure

  that Rajaratnam was deprived of title to her land and could not recover the same from the

  Plaintiff, who claimed to be (but as he and his fellow conspirators well knew) was not the

  bona fide purchaser of the land for value without notice of Rajaratnam’s claim.</p>
<p align="justify">On 17 April 1978 the Plaintiff brought an action against Rajaratnam in

  the High Court of Malaysia to remove a caveat registered against the land at Kulai by her.

  It was presided over by Mr Justice Syed Othman. The Plaintiff proceeded on the basis that

  he had bought the land as a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice. The Court

  accepted the Plaintiff’s claim and found in his favour, rejecting Rajaratnam’s

  contention that the transfer to the Plaintiff was bogus. In fact, the Plaintiff had not

  been a bona fide purchaser for value but had been a nominee or trustee for Singh. The

  Plaintiff was aware of this at the time of the hearing. By fraudulently concealing the

  true position from the Court the Plaintiff misled Mr Justice Syed Othman into erroneously

  presuming that he was a bona fide purchaser for value and finding in the Plaintiff’s

  favour.</p>
<p align="justify">In support of the defendant’s contention that the Plaintiff’s

  execution of the transfer of 31 July 1975 was fraudulent and that his conduct misled Mr

  Justice Syed Othman, the Defendant relies upon the fact that on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of

  the hearing of Rajaratnam’s action ("the Rajaratnam Action") against

  Suppiah, Singh and the Plaintiff before Mr Justice Abdul Razak the Plaintiff withdrew his

  pleaded case that he was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the land at

  Kulai and conceded that he had always been a mere nominee or trustee for his fellow

  conspirator, Singh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">94.    The additional particulars relied on were that

the M &amp; R has specific responsibility for ensuring the proper conduct of its members.

The plaintiff, appointed as the chairman in 1998, had an important role to play in

ensuring that the members of the Club behaved in a proper manner and as such would be

called upon to take appropriate action against those who did not do so.</p>
<i><b>
<p>Qualified privilege</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">95.    Further or alternatively, the defendant averred

that he had a civic, moral or social duty to publish the words complained of to the

president of the Club and its GC members. It was alleged that those persons had a

corresponding duty or interest to receive the publication complained of. Hence, the

defence of qualified privilege applied.</p>
<p align="justify">96.    The particulars given were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Defendant is a member of the Tanglin Club and thus its affairs are

  of legitimate and personal concern to him.</p>
<p align="justify">The General Committee of the Tanglin Club is responsible for the

  management of the Club’s affairs including the conduct of the Club’s finances

  and the conduct of its members. The rules and Membership Sub-Committee particularly is

  responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of its members and for determining whether

  applicants for membership should be permitted to join the Club.</p>
<p align="justify">In 1997 the Plaintiff was elected to the General Committee. In 1998 he

  was elected as its Vice-President. He thus had an influential role to play in not only the

  conduct of the Club’s affairs in general but also in the management of its finances.

  Furthermore, due to his appointment as Chairman of the Rules and Membership Sub-Committee

  in 1998, he had a prominent role to play in ensuring that the members of the Club behaved

  in a proper manner and as such would be called upon to take appropriate action against

  those who did not do so. In this role he also played an important part in determining who

  would be suitable to join the Club. These roles were of paramount importance to the Club.

  Thus the Plaintiff’s suitability to serve in such positions was a matter of proper

  and legitimate interest to the Defendant and to the President and committee members of the

  Club.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>
<p>Fair Comment</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">97.    Further or alternatively, it was pleaded that the

said words were fair comment on a matter of public interest, viz the suitability of the

plaintiff to be the vice-president of the GC and chairman of the M &amp; R of the Club,

which the defendant described as one of the most prominent and influential private

members’ clubs in Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">98.    The following comment was said to be fair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) that the members of the Club should be informed by the plaintiff of

  his conduct pertaining to a Johore housewife’s land; </p>
<p align="justify">(b) that the plaintiff’s behaviour in respect of the Johore

  housewife’s land showed him to be a vicious and dangerous fraud; </p>
<p align="justify">(c) that the plaintiff would not properly and fairly administer Club

  justice as chairman and convenor of the M &amp; R; and</p>
<p align="justify">(d) given that the plaintiff is a most vicious and dangerous fraud he

  is not suitable to sit as chairman and convenor of the M &amp; R. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">99.    The particulars relied on were the same

particulars given under the justification defence. Further or alternatively, the words

complained of comprised a fair and accurate report of the judgment of Abdul Razak J in the

case of Mdm Tara Rajaratnam (‘Tara’) concerning Arul’s conduct.

Accordingly, the said words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege.</p>
<i><b>
<p>Estoppel</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">100.    The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff was

estopped from alleging that the words complained of in the letters set out above were

false by virtue of the following judgments:</p>
<ol type="a">
<i>
<li>Tara Rajaratnam v. Datuk Jagindar Singh &amp; Ors</li></i> <nobr>[1983] 2 MLJ 127</nobr> – Civil Suit

    No. 284 of 1979

  <i>
<li>Datuk Jagindar Singh &amp; Ors v. Tara Rajaranam</li></i> <nobr>[1983] 2 MLJ 196</nobr> – Federal

    Civil Appeal Nos. 215,216. 291 and 292 of 1982

  <i>
<li>Datuk Jagindar Singh &amp; Ors v. Tara Rajaratnam</li></i> <nobr>[1986] 1 MLJ 105</nobr> – Privy

    Council Appeal No. 39 of 1983.

</ol>
<p> </p>
<b>
<p>Submissions of Defendant's Counsel</p></b>
<p align="justify">101.    The defendant’s starting point is that the

substantive alleged offending words are statements of fact from or direct quotes of the

judgment of Abdul Razak J in Tara’s case. In summary, counsel put forward the

following 5 defences:<i><b></b></i></p>
<p align="justify">(a) <i><b>Justification</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">102.    The underlined words complained of in their

natural and ordinary meaning were true in substance and in fact in the meanings as pleaded

in the defence.</p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">(b) Qualified Privilege</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">103.    The defendant had a civic, moral or social duty

to publish those words to the Club’s GC members and these persons had a corresponding

duty or interest to receive the publications complained of. Accordingly, the words were

published on an occasion of qualified privilege. Furthermore, the publication by the

defendant was without any malice.</p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">(c) Fair Comment</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">104.    The words complained of were fair comment on a

matter of public interest, namely the suitability of the plaintiff to be the

vice-president of the GC and chairman of the M &amp; R.</p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">(d) Qualified Privilege</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">105.    The said words comprised a fair and accurate

report of the Abdul Razak J’s judgment in Civil Suit No 284 of 1979 concerning the

plaintiff’s conduct. The consent order of the Privy Council based on certain agreed

terms allowing the appeal of the plaintiff did not have the effect of undoing the

evidential findings of the considered judgment of Abdul Razak J on the merits after a full

trial, which decision was affirmed by the Federal Court after full arguments.</p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">(e) Estoppel</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">106.    The plaintiff is estopped from alleging that

those words were false by virtue of the three judgments mentioned above. Essentially, the

plaintiff cannot now deny the facts as found by Abdul Razak J concerning his character and

conduct.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Are the offending words defamatory?</p></b>
<p align="justify">107.    Whether the words are defamatory must be

determined by an objective test: Do the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the

estimation of right-thinking members of society generally? This test set out by Lord Atkin

in <i>Sim v Stretch</i> (1936) 52 TLC 669 at p 671 was adopted by the Court of Appeal in

Singapore in <i>Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 623</nobr>.</p>
<p align="justify">108.    Clearly, those words complained of do bring the

plaintiff into public odium and contempt, and they do lower him in the estimation of

right-thinking members of society generally. Hence, they are defamatory in nature. This

cannot be disputed. As those words are capable of several defamatory meanings (inferential

meanings included), it is necessary to identify them and then determine to what extent

those meanings have been proved, before finally deciding whether the sting in each of the

3 sets of publications is sufficiently justified. A partial justification, that is one

falling short of what it takes for the defendant to succeed in his defence of

justification, is relevant to the quantum of damages. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Meaning of the offending words</p></b>
<p align="justify">109.    I am mindful of what the Court of Appeal had

said in <i>Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng</i> at p 638, 647 and 648 concerning the proper

approach to take when determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained

of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In considering the natural and ordinary meaning of the words the proper

  approach is to consider what meaning the words would convey to an ordinary reasonable

  person who is neither unduly nave or suspicious, using his general knowledge and common

  sense. Such a meaning is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words but

  includes any inferences which can reasonably be drawn by such person: see <i>Rubber

  Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd</i> [1964] AC 234 at p 258; and <i>Jones v Skelton</i>

  [1963] 3 All ER 952 at p 958.<br/>

  ….. <br/>

  …..</p>
<p align="justify">On this issue it is necessary to consider first what precisely the

  respondents sought to justify. The law on this point is now quite clear. Where a defendant

  in a defamation action pleads justification, he must do so in such a way as to inform the

  plaintiff and the court precisely what meaning or meanings he seeks to justify: see <i>Lucas-Box

  v News Gropup Newspapers Ltd</i> [1986] 1 WLR 147, at p 153; <i>Viscount De L’Isle v

  Times Newspaper</i> Ltd [1988] 1 WLR 49, at p 60 and <i>Prager v Times Newspapers Ltd</i>

  [1988] 1 WLR 77, at p 86. ….<br/>

  ….<br/>

  The law on this is clear: the issues to be tried under the plea of justification are

  limited to the matters referred to in the particulars: <i>Yorkshire Provident Life

  Assurance Co v Gilbert &amp; Rivington</i> [1895] 2 QB 148, 152. Be that as it may, the

  crucial question is whether within the confines of their pleadings the respondents have

  succeeded in proving the facts averred in the particulars and, on the basis of these

  facts, in justifying the sting in [the] libel.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>
<p>Meaning ascribed by Defendant</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">110.    I have some difficulty establishing precisely

what meaning the defendant wants to ascribe to those alleged defamatory words. The pleaded

meaning in paragraph 6.1 of the amended defence, "that the Plaintiff is guilty of

fraud and breach of trust against a Johore housewife", is not clear to me. Is it a

bare statement of fact that the plaintiff was found guilty by Abdul Razak J. of fraud and

breach of trust, without the added and wider imputation that the plaintiff must still be

regarded at the time of the 3 defamatory publications as ‘plainly dishonest, an

imposter, a most vicious and dangerous fraud, a liar and a chameleon’, which were

some of the learned judge’s epithets quoted by the defendant? Counsel for the

defendant eventually clarified that the pleaded meaning included such an imputation.</p>
<p align="justify">111.    Based on the clarification, I am given to

understand that the plaintiff’s past conduct, albeit some decades ago, had tainted

the plaintiff’s character to an extent that it has become a permanent scar on his

reputation and character, so much so that he must still be regarded presently as being

seriously flawed in his character. As such, they remain apt descriptions of him today.

Therefore those descriptions remain true of the plaintiff at the time of the publications.

I note that this is consistent with the meaning pleaded at 6.3 of the amended defence that

the plaintiff is accordingly unfit to hold office as the vice-president of the club

because the scar has not been removed so to speak by the very long passage of time, or by

any good conduct thereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">112.    Looking at paragraphs 6 c and 6 d of the

statement of claim, one can see that they include the alleged defamatory meaning that

‘he is a vicious and dangerous fraud’. Those words imply that the plaintiff was

and still is a ‘vicious and dangerous fraud’. Basically, he is not a changed

man. Under this description can be subsumed many of the other derogatory descriptions of

the plaintiff. </p>
<p align="justify">113.    Since the plaintiff’s own pleaded meaning

is exactly the same as the wider meaning now put forward by the defendant, I do not think

it right to disallow the defendant’s justification of those other meanings as

clarified to me at trial although they were not made particularly clear in the

defendant’s amended defence. I thus gave the defendant leeway to justify everything

injurious that the plaintiff had pleaded in his statement of claim, which is considerably

wider than that pleaded by the defendant in his amended defence. I do not think that the

plaintiff was in any way caught by surprise or prejudiced by this. </p>
<i><b>
<p>Meaning of "fraud"</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">114.    The defendant contended that the natural and

ordinary meaning of the word "fraud" is very wide and is as provided below:</p>
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">Blacks Law Dictionary</p>
</b><p align="justify">Fraud….A generic term, embracing all multifarious means which

  human ingenuity can devise, and which are resorted to by one individual to get advantage

  over another by false suggestions or by suppression of the truth, and includes all

  surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling, and any unfair way by which another is cheated.

  Johnson v. McDonald, 170 Okl. 117, 39 P.2d 150. "Bad faith" and

  "fraud" are synonymous, and also synonyms of dishonesty, infidelity,

  faithlessness, perfidy, unfairness, etc….</p>
<p align="justify">…As distinguished from negligence, it is always positive,

  intentional. It comprises all acts, omissions, and concealments involving a breach of a

  legal or equitable duty and resulting in damage to another. And includes anything

  calculated to deceive, whether it be a single act or combination of circumstances, whether

  the suppression of truth or the suggestion of what is false, whether it be by direct

  falsehood or by innuendo, by speech or by silence, by word of mouth, or by look or

  gesture. Fraud, as applied to contracts, is the cause of any error bearing on a material

  part of the contract created or continued by artifice, with design to obtain some unjust

  advantage to the one party, or to cause an inconvenience or loss to the other.</p>
<p align="justify">..It is something said, done, or omitted by a person with the design of

  perpetrating what he knows to be a cheat or deception. Constructive fraud consists in any

  act of commission or omission contrary to legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence

  justly reposed, which is contrary to good conscience and operates to the injury of

  another… </p>
<b><p align="justify">New Webster’s Dictionary</p>
</b><p align="justify">fraud n. the use of deception for unlawful gain or unjust

  advantage; something that constitutes a criminal deception; someone who is not what he

  pretends he is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">115.    The two dictionaries do give a good explanation

of what fraud entails and what it generally means. However, I do not think it is a term

capable of precise definition, and I shall not attempt any definition of it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Defamatory meanings found</p></b>
<p align="justify">116.    In my opinion, the ordinary, reasonable and

fair-minded reader, having read each of the defendant’s publications in their

entirety but without any meticulous analysis of the passages or the words used in the

publications, will come to understand the offending words in their context to bear the

meanings defamatory of the plaintiff as set out at the paragraphs 124 to 127, 130 and 131

below. Allowance has to be made for the fact that the ordinary reader may not be

thoroughly familiar with fine technical and legal distinctions. Mr Vince Khoo, a member of

the GC, for instance told the court that he is not aware that there is a distinction

between the criminal and civil aspect referred to in the letters published by the

defendant. </p>
<p align="justify">117.    In this regard, it is apt to observe what LP

Thean J (as he then was) had said in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Davies &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1989] SLR 1063</nobr> at p1080 that the rules of construction applicable in construing a contract or a will

are not appropriate for the purpose of construction of the words complained of by a

plaintiff in a defamation suit. The proper approach is to consider what meaning the words

will convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense.

Such meaning, the learned judge said, is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of

the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by

such persons. The learned judge also quoted Lord Devlin’s speech in <i>Rubber

Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd</i> [1964] AC 234 at p 277, where it was stated that

‘the layman reads in an implication much more freely; and unfortunately, as the law

of defamation has to take into account, is especially prone to do so when it is

derogatory.’ </p>
<p align="justify">118.    Alderson B in <i>Chalmers v Payne </i>(1835) 2

Cr.M &amp; R 156 said at p 159 that if "in one part of the publication something

disreputable to the plaintiff is stated, but that is removed by the conclusion, the bane

and the antidote must be taken together." I am thus conscious of the need to take

account of the entire context and circumstances of each publication at the time of

publication, and to consider whether any other part of the same publication might have

removed the sting in the words complained of in that publication.</p>
<p align="justify">119.    But I do not think that a subsequent publication

to the same persons removing the sting so to speak of an earlier publication will help the

defendant if the earlier publication is already defamatory of the plaintiff. The damage

has already been done. The subsequent publication diluting or erasing the sting will only

be relevant to the question whether the damages suffered should be reduced. For the

purpose of determining the defamatory meaning in the first publication, it will be wrong

to read it together with a later publication. One must read the first publication by

itself. However, for determining the defamatory meaning in the <u><b>second</b></u>

publication, the information provided in the first publication to the same body of persons

may be taken as background information or part of the overall context, depending on how

close in time the two publications are. If it is separated by a long lapse of time, with

the likely result that an ordinary reader of normal memory span, would not have recalled

or remembered what was said in the earlier publication, then it may not be proper to take

that earlier publication into consideration as part of the total context in which to

construe the meaning in the second publication.</p>
<p align="justify">120.    What happens if the defendant deliberately

highlights the defamatory parts that he wishes to emphasize, whether by the use of large

fonts, bolding, underlining or other markings, and he puts the words supplying the

‘antidote’ in a footnote, or in some other remote corner of the publication in

small fine print for instance, or he buries them somewhere in the voluminous attachments

or annexes in the same publication? One then has to consider if the ordinary reasonably

diligent reader would have noticed and read the ‘antidote’, having regard to the

manner the entire publication is set out and presented. The mere presence of the

‘antidote’ does not necessarily neutralize the effects of the defamatory words

if the hypothetical ordinary and reasonably diligent reader would probably have missed it.

I cannot see why a defendant should be given the benefit of the neutralizing effects of

the antidote if he draws the attention of the ordinary reader to the sting but hides away

the medicine to be beyond easy reach. </p>
<p align="justify">121.    I observe in this case that the defendant, who

has a good command of the English language, mentioned in his 1<sup>st</sup> publication a

report of the plaintiff’s ‘<b>conviction</b> for fraud and breach of trust

against the housewife in Johore’. ‘Conviction’ is generally used for

criminal matters. But the defendant applied it to Arul as if he had been charged and later

convicted of some criminal offence and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. If the defendant

had himself misread the newspaper article, what about the ordinary reader. Moreover with

the highlighting and selective emphasis by the defendant, I will not be surprised if the

ordinary reader, less sophisticated perhaps than the defendant, jumps to the wrong

conclusion that the plaintiff had been convicted of a criminal offence of fraud and

criminal breach of trust and for that, he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. The

meanings will therefore include those that an ordinary reader will likely construe, even

if erroneously, for the reasons I have stated. </p>
<p align="justify">122.    With the above guiding principles in mind, I now

set out the various defamatory meanings (including the imputations) which the underlined

words can reasonably give rise to. I will leave out those meanings which are

non-defamatory. </p>
<i><b>
<p>Meaning of defamatory statements in the 1st publication</p></b>
</i>
<p align="justify">123.    It is not disputed that the whole series of

correspondence between the plaintiff and defendant up to and including the 10 July 1998

were published on 10 July 1998 to the GC members. They constitute the 1st publication.

None of the correspondence mentioned the outcome of the appeals to the Federal Court of

Criminal Appeal and the Privy Council. The fact that Tara had withdrawn all her

allegations against the plaintiff was also not mentioned. </p>
<p align="justify">124.    Accordingly, I find that an ordinary fair minded

GC member, in the absence of further information, will understand the offending words (as

underlined) in the correspondence attached to the 1st publication to mean that:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) A High Court Judge had found the plaintiff to be a most vicious and

  dangerous fraud.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The plaintiff is in fact a most vicious and dangerous fraud.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The plaintiff stands guilty and convicted of fraud and breach of

  trust against a simple, naive housewife, Tara.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) He, together with two others, were accordingly sentenced to 2 years

  imprisonment. </p>
<p align="justify">(e) He should have been too ashamed to run for the post of

  vice-president after what the High Court Judge had called him. Nevertheless he offered

  himself for election and was elected when he should not be. What is worse is that it puts

  him next in line for the post of president, which he may win by default at the next

  election. </p>
<p align="justify">(f) The plaintiff concealed his conviction for fraud and breach of

  trust from the Club members. By his dishonest non-disclosure, he had misled those members

  who voted for him. </p>
<p align="justify">(g) He is totally unfit to hold any office in the Club because he is a

  most vicious and dangerous fraud. He is not fit to sit with other respectable members in

  the GC.</p>
<p align="justify">(h) His scandalous past brings absolute disgrace to the Club. The Club

  will be further disgraced if the press learns of his past misconduct and makes it public.</p>
<p align="justify">(i) He has lost all his moral authority over the staff of the Club and

  is unfit to tell them what to do. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">125.    Based on the meanings I have found, plainly the

sting in the first publication is that the plaintiff is an extremely vicious and dangerous

fraud. He has been convicted of fraud and breach of trust, and sentenced to 2 years

imprisonment. He is unfit to hold any office in the Club.<i><b></b></i></p>
<p>Meaning of defamatory statements in the 2<sup>nd</sup> publication</p>
<p align="justify">126.    The GC members received the 2<sup>nd</sup>

publication approximately 3 weeks after the 1<sup>st</sup> publication. Presumably, they

would not have forgotten what they had read in the 1<sup>st</sup> publication. I therefore

construe both publications together to determine the defamatory meanings conveyed by the

words complained of in the 2<sup>nd</sup> publication and I find them to be as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The plaintiff’s curriculum vitae includes the fact that a High

  Court judge had called him a most vicious and dangerous fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">(b) As president of the Club who appointed the plaintiff as the

  chairman of the M &amp; R, does Mr Rasmussen still consider the plaintiff to be the best

  choice over nine other possible candidates in the GC to serve in that position now that he

  knows the plaintiff is a most vicious and dangerous fraud? It is imputed that the

  plaintiff does not deserve to hold that office and is unfit to do so. There are nine other

  better candidates.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The plaintiff will not discharge his duties as chairman of the M

  &amp; R honestly and fairly because he is a most vicious and dangerous fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">(e) The president will lose the trust and confidence of the Club

  membership if he allows the plaintiff to stay on as chairman of the M &amp; R. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">127.    On top of those in the 1<sup>st</sup>

publication, the additional sting here is that the plaintiff is incapable of discharging

his duties as chairman of the M &amp; R in a fair and honest manner. </p>
<i><b>
<p>Meaning of defamatory statements in the 3<sup>rd</sup> publication</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">128.    The 3<sup>rd</sup> publication was sent to the

GC members about 2 weeks after the 2<sup>nd</sup> publication. What they had read earlier

would probably remain relatively fresh in their minds. Thus, it will be wrong to construe

the offending words as underlined in the 3<sup>rd</sup> publication comprising 2 letters

both dated 18 August 1998 without regard to the context of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

publications. Extracts from the judgment of Abdul Razak J. were attached to one of the

letters.</p>
<p align="justify">129.    Enclosing the judgment of Justice Abdul Razak

containing the rather inconspicuous editorial note is not sufficient in my view to draw

the reasonable reader’s attention to the facts stated in that editorial note. I find

that the reasonable reader will probably not pay attention to and hence, miss reading the

editorial note. Even if he did glance at it cursorily, he will likely miss the

significance of what is stated therein, due to the defendant’s overwhelming emphasis

given to Arul’s conviction and sentence of 2 years and to the learned judge’s

other adverse findings on his character and conduct. Further, the defendant tells the

reader that his purpose of attaching the judgment is to refresh the plaintiff’s

memory of what the learned judge had said, and to ask the plaintiff not to pretend that

the judge did not give him those labels. Hence, I conclude that it is not likely for the

ordinary reader of ordinary diligence to have bothered much with the editorial note (in

fine print and in brackets in the judgment), but he will far more likely focus his

attention on the highly derogatory descriptions of the plaintiff in the various parts of

the judgment proper, which the defendant highlighted. The ordinary reader will therefore

in all probability miss the significance of what is stated in the editorial note. </p>
<p align="justify">130.    With the above in mind, I find that the

underlined words in the 3<sup>rd</sup> publication are capable of bearing the following

defamatory meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The plaintiff’s ‘curriculum vitae’ includes the fact

  that he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment for contempt, that he had committed fraud

  and breach of trust against a defenceless housewife, that he is not a lamb but a wolf in

  lamb’s wool, that he is dishonest, a liar, an imposter, a chameleon changing his

  colour as it suits him, and there is still much more. In summary, he is a most vicious and

  dangerous fraud.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) A High Court judge had described him as such.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) By any objective standard, the plaintiff is totally unfit to chair

  the M &amp; R.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) He will not discharge his duties as chairman of the M &amp; R

  honestly and fairly because he is a most vicious and dangerous fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">(e) By allowing the plaintiff to continue as chairman of the M &amp; R,

  Mr Rasmussen will lose the complete trust and confidence placed in him by the Club members

  as their elected president.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">131.    The stings in the defamatory words complained of

in this 3<sup>rd</sup> publication are no different from that in the earlier two

publications.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Defence of Justification</p></b>
<p align="justify">132.    On the issue of justification, I find paragraphs

1111 and 1112 in Gatley on Libel and Slander 8<sup>th</sup> Edn at page 1108 to be

instructive: </p>
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">1111. Reasonable imputations must be covered.</p></b> The plea of

  justification must be not only as broad as the literal language of the libel but as broad

  as the inferences of fact necessarily flowing from the literal language. A plea of

  justification means that all the words were true, and covers not only the bare statements

  of fact contained in the alleged libel but also any imputation which the words in their

  context may be taken to convey; it affirms all that attaches to them as their natural and

  reasonable meaning; the inferences that would ordinarily be drawn from them. 

  <p align="justify">1112 Examples. ….And where the defendant called the plaintiff a

  poacher it was held that a plea that the plaintiff had been convicted six years before for

  poaching was no justification, for the natural inference which would be drawn from the

  charge is that the plaintiff was a poacher at the time when the charge was made (<i>Brownlie

  v. Thompson </i>(1851) 21 D.480 (Ct . of Sess.).</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>
<p>Substantial Justification is Sufficient</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">133.    I accept as a general proposition of law that it

is the imputation contained in the words complained of, which has to be justified to be

substantially true, and not the literal truth of the words, nor some other similar charges

or meanings not contained in, or not capable of being reasonably borne out by the words.

Where those words contain both statements of fact and comment, then the defendant must not

only prove the truth of the material facts but also that his comments are true and correct

based on all such relevant facts as proved, in order to succeed on a defence of

justification. It is sufficient for the defendant to justify the substance of the facts

and comments complained of. It is not necessary to justify anything which adds nothing to

the sting of the charge. See Gatley on Libel and Slander (9<sup>th</sup> Ed) at paras 11.5

to 11.7 and <i>Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng</i> at p 649 E. Halsbury Laws of England 4<sup>th</sup>

Edn Vol 28 also states the above in broadly similar terms at para 85:</p>
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">Substantial justification of a single charge. </p></b>A justification of

  the sting of a libel may be sufficient even if it does not extend to every epithet or

  detail in the words complained of (<i>Edwards v Bell</i> (1824) 1 Bing 403 at 409).

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">134.    Where the defendant is unable to prove the truth

of some of the charges he has made against the plaintiff, his defence of justification

nevertheless still succeeds if those unproved charges have not materially injured the

plaintiff’s reputation any further. This is provided for in Section 8 of the

Defamation Act (Cap. 75) which states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In an action for libel or slander in respect of words containing two or

  more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of justification shall not fail by

  reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be

  true do not materially injure the plaintiff’s reputation having regard to the truth

  of the remaining charges. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">135.    Naturally, this section is of no application

where the words complained of give rise to only one charge against the plaintiff. Nor will

it assist the defendant when all he can prove is a charge less serious than the charges he

fails to prove, or is in a different aspect of the plaintiff’s reputation. For

instance, if all that the defendant can prove is that the plaintiff is a chameleon, that

is not enough when he has also called the plaintiff a most vicious and dangerous fraud,

which has far more deleterious effects on the plaintiff’s reputation.</p>
<p align="justify">136.    Where there are several material defamatory

statements of fact in the publication or several defamatory inferences of fact which can

reasonably be drawn by the ordinary reader from the publication as a whole, as in this

case, then the defendant must prove the substantial truth of all the different material

facts and inferential facts before he can be said to have successfully justified the

entire libel. In other words, if more than one sting exists in the libel, then the

justification must extend to all the different stings. Otherwise, he will be held liable

for the remainder of the stings not justified and for which no other defences are

available.</p>
<p align="justify">137.    Stark J. in a decision of the High Court of

Australia, <i>Howden v "Truth" and Sportsman" Ltd and Anor</i> [1937] 58

C.L.R. 416, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The pleas of the respondents justify the entire libel and every

  substantial or material statement in it must be proved true or the pleas fail. <u>It would

  not be enough</u> on the pleas now and under consideration <u>to prove that part only of

  the statements were true</u>. The libel charges that the appellant was convicted of a

  crime and was sentenced to imprisonment in respect of that crime. It is not true that the

  appellant was convicted of crime and suffered a term of imprisonment. The statement cannot

  be proved true by proving that he was convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment

  but that his conviction was quashed. <u>Such a statement has a wholly different effect</u>

  (See Leyman v. Latimer (1877) 3 Ex.D. 15, at p. 21). (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">138.    Dixon J. held similar views. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defence depends upon the substantial truth of the defamatory

  meaning conveyed by a libel. Every material part of the imputations upon the plaintiff

  contained in the words complained of must be true; otherwise the justification fails as an

  answer to the action. The imputation contained in a statement that a man has been

  convicted of an indictable offence and sentenced to imprisonment is not, in my opinion,

  sustained by proof of a conviction and sentence quashed on appeal, and no finding that the

  imputation was true should be allowed to stand. I find it difficult to imagine any

  circumstances in which <u>an unqualified statement</u> that a man had been convicted and

  sentenced could be reasonably held to be substantially true, when the fact was that the

  conviction had been vacated, <u>however technical the ground for setting it aside might

  have been</u>. The difference in the present case between the actual facts and the

  imputation made appears to me to be very wide indeed and to make it quite improper to

  submit to the jury so much of the justification as relates to the statement that the

  plaintiff was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to fifteen months’

  imprisonment. In the circumstances I think the pleas should be struck out. (Emphasis is

  mine)</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>Burden and Standard of Proof</p></b>
<p align="justify">139.    The stings in all the libels can be broadly

amalgamated into one: the plaintiff was and is a most vicious and dangerous fraud, and the

defendant has to justify that. Being such a serious allegation, the defendant is required

to prove it to a high degree of probability. It is obviously not the criminal standard of

proof beyond reasonable doubt, but it certainly will not be on a mere balance of

probability. The Court of Appeal in <i>Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank</i>
<nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 258</nobr> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In <i>Hornal v Neuberger Products</i> [1957] 1 QB 247, the Court of

  Appeal of England adopted the latter approach but with a significant qualification. The

  Court of Appeal interpreted the civil standard as one which varied depending on the

  gravity and seriousness of the allegation. The more serious the allegation, the higher the

  required standard of proof. …..Hodson LJ at p 263 approved a passage from an earlier

  case of <i>Bater v Bater</i> [1951] P35 where Denning LJ said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">..So also in civil cases, the case may be proved by a preponderance of

    probability but there may be degrees of probability within that standard. The degree

    depends on the subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will

    naturally require for itself a higher degree of probability than that which it would

    require when asking if negligence is established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a

    criminal court, even when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature; but still it

    does require a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In <i>Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij NV v Koh Kim Guan</i> <nobr>[1959] MLJ 173</nobr>, … the High Court of Singapore….had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Whatever the precise formula adopted and whatever the theoretical

    position may be, it has long been the practice in countries where the English system of

    law operates for the courts, in civil cases, to require <b>a high standard of proof</b> in

    cases where fraud is alleged. [Emphasis added.] </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In another case in the High Court, <i>Eastern Enterprises v Ong Choo

  Kim</i> <nobr>[1969] 1 MLJ 236</nobr>; <nobr>[1969-1971] SLR 206</nobr>…..AV Winslow J applied the standard

  espoused by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Hornal’s</i> case, namely, that the

  more serious the allegation made by one party, the higher the standard of proof it had to

  satisfy. He held…:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">..for purposes of this action that the plaintiffs must establish their

    allegation against the defendant on a balance of probability as laid down by <b><i>Doe d

    Devine v Wilson</i> subject to the qualification that in tilting the balance against the

    defendant, they must attain a higher degree of probability than is required in an ordinary

    case of civil negligence though not the very high standard of the criminal law</b>.

    [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and further on he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The crux of the matter in deciding how high the standard of proof

    should be, short of proof beyond reasonable doubt, the court should act on its own good

    sense, having regard to the realities of the situation and apply that standard short of

    certainty which enables it to be reasonably satisfied that a grave allegation in the

    course of civil proceedings has been substantiated since there is obviously no precise

    mathematical formula which it can apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In <i>Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Kartika Ratna Thahir</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 776</nobr>,

  the cases of <i>Hornal</i> and <i>Nederlandsche</i> were cited but the following caveat

  was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">However, it should be noted that it is not the law of evidence that

    every step in the allegation of fraud has to be proved by calling live and admissible

    evidence nor is it the law that fraud cannot be inferred in the appropriate case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Nonetheless, as regards allegations of fraud, forgery or criminal

  conduct, the standard of proof is to be determined according to the approach in

  Hornal’s case. This much is clear from p 776 of that judgment where it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">This is not to say that inference of this serious nature should be

    lightly made. The circumstantial evidence must be so compelling and convincing that <b>bearing

    in mind the high standard of proof</b> one is nevertheless satisfied that an inference of

    fraud is justified. [Emphasis added.] </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Evidence Act</p></b>
<p align="justify">140.    Where facts are not agreed or admitted by the

parties, they must be proved by admissible evidence. Documents which are not in the

bundles agreed as to authenticity must be proved in the usual way before they can be

admitted into evidence. Regard must be had to the Evidence Act as to what amounts to

relevant evidence that is admissible. In relation to the relevancy and admissibility of a

judgment, sections 42 to 46 of the Evidence Act are of interest. But these provisions do

not help, if the defendant wishes to rely on what has been stated as undisputed facts or

facts found by the Malaysian Courts or the Privy Council as evidence to prove those same

facts in this trial.</p>
<p align="justify">141.    Subject to s 42 to 45A, a previous judgment

making certain findings of fact cannot be merely tendered in another trial as proof of the

existence or the truth of those facts. If questions of res judicata or issue estoppel

arise for determination for instance, then the previous judgment is admissible under s 42,

(a) to prove the existence of that previous judicial determination as a final judgment of

a competent court, and (b) to establish what the cause of action there was, who the

parties were, in what capacities they were litigating, and what exactly were the issues

previously determined so that the court can decide those questions. But this by no means

provides the gateway for the flood of facts established in other judicial forums to be

admitted as evidence or as conclusive proof of the same facts which are in dispute in

another trial where all or some of the parties are different. The general rule is that the

production of a previous judgment merely evidences the fact that there has been a judgment

and there are certain legal consequences. But tendering the previous judgment and then

quoting parts of the judgment at length in a question to which the witness refuses to

accept as being undisputed will not <i>per se</i> amount to evidence proving the

correctness or the truth of any of the facts mentioned therein. </p>
<p align="justify">142.    I follow the strict approach. I am mindful of

the hearsay rule. Where the evidence amounts to hearsay, it can only be admitted if the

hearsay evidence comes in under the exceptions to the hearsay rule as provided for in the

Evidence Act. Hence, reading out chunks of any judgment relating to certain facts (whether

disputed or not) as found previously by a court to a witness at this trial, in particular

to Arul, as a prelude to the questions asked of him during his cross-examination, will not

turn that narration by counsel into evidence to prove those facts, if Arul does not admit

or agree to them. The defendant was hoping at this trial to prove that the plaintiff is a

most vicious and dangerous fraud through the plaintiff himself, without calling any other

witnesses. Obviously it is going to be an uphill task, considering that the plaintiff is a

lawyer with several years of experience. It was a risk they took, of which I have made

known to them prior to the trial. The defendant himself has no personal knowledge of what

happened in the Tara matter and hence, he was in no position to testify to anything that

happened in relation to that matter. Madam Tara, who had been located by the defendant,

was not called to give any evidence of what happened. The plaintiff was wise and very

careful during his testimony at this trial not to admit to any facts he had no personal

knowledge of, even though the courts in the Tara case had made certain findings of the

background facts, which were said to be largely undisputed. That severely restricted the

defendant in what he could properly adduce during the plaintiff’s cross-examination

as evidence in support of his own justification defence. </p>
<p align="justify">143.    I am also mindful that I have to consider

whether those facts not proved have not materially injured his reputation after taking

account of those other facts and imputations that the defendant manages to prove to the

requisite degree of probability commensurate with the gravity of the charges. If his

reputation has not materially suffered because of those facts not proved, then the

justification defence still succeeds.</p>
<p align="justify">144.    However, in relation to what Arul had (a)

testified to in evidence at the previous trial before Justice Abdul Razak (for which notes

to discredit him, contradict his testimony, or establish the contrary facts or admissions,

by proof that he had indeed said something very different on some previous occasion. The

relevance and admissibility under these circumstances have been clearly provided for in

other sections of the Evidence Act.</p>

<b>
<p>Evidence adduced for Justification Defence</p></b>
<p align="justify">145.    I will now set out the material evidence adduced

by the defendant to establish his defence of justification. </p>
<p align="justify">146.    I treat the following as agreed facts. They are

not disputed and parties have not asked for strict proof. I extracted them substantially

from the plaintiff’s own affidavit. The plaintiff cannot possibly deny them.</p>
<p align="justify">147.    In 1979, Tara Rajaratnam (‘Tara’), a

housewife in Johore commenced Civil Suit No. 284 of 1979 in Johor Bahru for, <i>inter alia</i>,

fraud and breach of trust against Mr Jagindar Singh (‘Singh’) and Dato P.

Suppiah (‘Suppiah’). Arul was included as the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant in that

suit on Tara’s allegations that he had colluded with Singh and Supiah to defraud her.

On 17 July 1982, Abdul Razak J entered interlocutory judgment on Tara’s claim and

also sentenced all 3 defendants to 2 years imprisonment for contempt of court.</p>
<p align="justify">148.    The defendants appealed against the

interlocutory judgment by way of Federal Court Civil Appeal Nos. 215, 216, 291 and 292 of

1982. There was a separate appeal by way of Federal Court of Criminal Appeals Nos 28 to 30

against the finding of contempt of court and the sentence of 2 years imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">149.    On 24 September 1982, the Federal Court of

Criminal Appeal allowed their appeal against the findings of contempt of court and set

aside the decision and sentence.</p>
<p align="justify">150.    On 21 November 1982, Abdul Razak J decided on

the quantum of damages to be awarded to Tara pursuant to his interlocutory judgment. </p>
<p align="justify">151.    On 16 May 1983, the Federal Court of Civil

Appeal dismissed the appeals by Singh, Suppiah and Arul, against the interlocutory

judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">152.    All three of them appealed to the Privy Council

vide Privy Council Appeal No. 39 of 1983. During the course of arguments before the Privy

Council, their Lordships were informed that Tara had consented to Arul’s appeal with

each party bearing their own costs, and that all her allegations of fraud and constructive

trusteeship were withdrawn. Their Lordships in their judgment said the following which was

reported at p 112G <nobr>[1986] 1 MLJ 105</nobr>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">As regards the third appellant (i.e. Arul), their Lordships were

  informed in the course of the hearing before them that his counsel and that for the

  respondent were agreed that his appeal should be allowed by consent, upon the terms that

  all allegations of fraud against the third appellant were withdrawn, and also any claim

  against him as allegedly a constructive trustee, and that as between him and the

  respondent (i.e. Tara) there should be no order as to costs here or in the courts below.

  Their Lordships consider it proper in the circumstances that the third appellant’s

  appeal should be allowed upon these terms. <b>It is abundantly plain that he had no hand

  whatever in the events of March 30, 1974, which form the basis of the respondent’s

  case of fraud against the other appellants. (Emphasis is mine.)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">153.    It is not disputed that on 16 December 1985, the

Registrar of the Privy Council in his report of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the

Privy Council to the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Lords of the Committee …… report to Your Majesty as their

  opinion that …(3) the Appeal of the Third Appellant ought by consent to be allowed

  and the Judgment and Order of the Federal Court of Malaysia dated 16<sup>th</sup> May 1983

  and the Judgments and Orders of the High Court of Malaysia dated 17th July 1982 and 21<sup>st</sup>

  November 1982 <b>insofar as they were adverse to the Third Appellant set aside</b> on the

  following terms (1) <u>the Respondent withdraws all allegations of fraud (<b>of whatsoever

  nature</b>) against the Third Appellant (2) the Respondent withdraws all claims that the

  Third Appellant was acting as Constructive Trustee as alleged in the Respondent’s

  case or at all </u>(3) as between the Respondent and the Third Appellant there be no order

  as to costs in respect of these proceedings in the High Court or the Federal Court.

  (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">154.    I was at first concerned whether Arul had paid

money to Tara to achieve that outcome. Arul assured me on oath that he had not paid Tara

any monies or compensation to consent to his appeal being allowed.</p>
<p align="justify">155.    I accept the submission of plaintiff’s

counsel that there is no admissible evidence adduced by the defendant that in 1974, Tara,

a Johore housewife, entered into an agreement with Suppiah whereby she agreed to transfer

land owned by her at Kulai in Malaysia only as security for an advance of $220,000. There

is no evidence that on 30 March 1974, Suppiah and Singh went to Tara’s house in

Johore, where Tara signed a transfer and memorandum in favour of Suppiah. There is no

evidence of what was in fact said on that occasion. Hence, no evidence was adduced that

Suppiah and Singh had fraudulently induced Tara to enter into the said agreement by

falsely and knowingly representing to her that the transaction on 30 March 1974 was of the

nature of a security that would enable her to redeem the property by repaying the sum of

M$220,000 at any time, when the truth was that Suppiah and Singh treated the transaction

as an outright sale coupled with an option to re-purchase the property for that sum within

a year of the agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">156.    The other particulars under the defence of

justification that Suppiah and Singh had falsely and knowingly represented to Tara that it

was their intention to treat the transaction as a secured loan, when in fact they had no

intention of allowing Tara to redeem the property at any time, is again not supported by

admissible evidence. Thus, there is no evidence by which to conclude that Suppiah and

Singh had through those representations induced Tara to enter the transaction. Tara could

have given evidence on all this but the defendant chose not to call her although it is his

burden to prove these facts. </p>
<p align="justify">157.    No witness came to testify that the alleged

transfer of the land from Tara to Suppiah was at a purported total consideration to Tara

of MR220,000 and the transfer was later dated 5 July 1975 and then registered on 22 July

1975, although there is a Form 14 A to that effect (4 ROP770). Since both its authenticity

and contents are not agreed, strict proof of that document is required. </p>
<p align="justify">158.    To avoid misunderstanding, I directed the

parties in the course of the trial to ascertain exactly what documents were agreed as to

authenticity and contents, and hence, to inform me what was the extent of their agreement

on each and every document. Both sides finally decided to take the fairly extreme position

that there was to be strict proof of every document since no agreement whatsoever could be

reached on the authenticity and contents of the documents particularly in relation to the

Tara matter. </p>
<p align="justify">159.    The significant document relied on by the

defence to prove the plaintiff’s dishonesty and fraud is Form 14 A under the National

Land Code for transfer of land, share or lease in Malaysia, which was signed by the

plaintiff (and admitted as exhibit 4 ROP 790). It states inter alia that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I, PAKRISAMY SUPPIAH (NRIC. No. 5571071) of No. 33, Jalan Meruing,

  Kebun Teh Park, Johor Bahru, proprietor of the land described in the schedule below:</p>
<p align="justify">IN CONSIDERATION of the sum of Dollars Two hundred and Twenty thousand

  ($220,000.00) only the receipt of which sum I hereby acknowledge;</p>
<p align="justify">Hereby transfer to the transferee named below, all such title or

  interest as is vested in me.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">t.t. (Arul Chandran)</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">160.    According to Arul, Singh had asked him to be his

trustee shortly before the above transfer on 31 July 1975, to which he agreed. Singh told

him that he wanted to develop the land and explained that it would be easier for him to do

it in the name of someone else. Arul had previously heard Singh ‘constantly moaning

and groaning’ about his poor relationship with the authorities in Malaysia. Arul said

that there was no way for him to find out if that was true. At the time he signed the Form

14A, he had minimal knowledge of the background behind the land transaction between Tara,

Suppiah and Singh. At that time, he had not seen the documents including the Form 14A

signed on 30 March 1974 by which Tara transferred her land to Suppiah. He knew that

Suppiah eventually was not buying the property but Singh was. He did not know for a fact

if Singh had already paid Suppiah the consideration. He only knew that Singh would be

paying for it. He therefore assumed that Singh would settle the payment somehow with

Suppiah, having regard to the fact that Singh and Suppiah were very close friends and in

the same law firm in Johore together. Arul testified that he had no reason to distrust

these two lawyers, who were already good friends of his at that time. </p>
<p align="justify">161.    In my opinion, there is no reasonable cause for

the plaintiff to suspect that there was anything sinister why Singh had asked him to be a

trustee in view of the explanation given to him. If indeed Singh had difficulties with the

authorities, it would make sense for Singh not to use his own name or even a company

controlled by him, but to use the plaintiff as a front to apply for approval for

sub-division of the land for development purposes. The plaintiff accepts that an

application had been made in his name for sub-division of the land. After sub-division

approval from the authorities is obtained, it does not really matter if Singh or a company

controlled by him becomes the registered owner of the sub-divided lots. The hurdle has

been crossed so to speak and the land development can proceed thereafter. </p>
<p align="justify">162.    Further, I accept the plaintiff’s evidence

that he trusted Singh, a very good friend of his, and a fellow lawyer. I believe the

plaintiff’s evidence that he readily agreed to be Singh’s trustee without

questioning Singh on the details of transactions that resulted in the land being

registered in Suppiah’s name. I do not think that the plaintiff would be really

interested in knowing about the complicated transactions unless he wanted to be involved

in the land development and wanted a share in the expected profits. I am inclined to think

that the plaintiff, having settled in Singapore by then, and having his own busy legal

practice here, was not particularly interested in this land development in Johore. No

evidence was adduced that he participated in any land development in Malaysia at all, or

that he was to have a share of the profit in the development of Tara’s land.</p>
<p align="justify">163.    The plaintiff admits that he did not personally

pay any part of the MR220,000 for the transfer to his name as reflected on the Form 14A.

Obviously it was for Singh, his beneficiary, to settle the payment. He was merely a

trustee for Singh. In that sense, the plaintiff was not the actual purchaser of the land,

and neither was he a bona fide purchaser for value. Singh was the actual purchaser. </p>
<p align="justify">164.    At this juncture, I must emphasize that payment

of the MR 220,000 need not always be made by direct cash payment by the trustee on behalf

of the beneficiary. A beneficiary buying the property can of course make payment through

his trustee, if he wishes. He can also pay the seller directly. Alternatively, he can pay

by directly discharging the debts of the seller owed to third parties at the seller’s

request. He can also pay by setting off other debts owed to him by the seller. There can

be a combination of some or all the above modes of payment to effect that payment of MR

220,000. </p>
<p align="justify">165.    As can be seen, payment may be made in a

multitude of ways by the beneficiary. Arul said that he left the payment matters to his

beneficiary, Singh, to handle. I do not find anything unusual in this nor in the fact that

Arul did not enquire from Singh how he was paying for it. There is nothing suspicious in

my view to cause Arul to be put on enquiry. The transfer form does not say that Arul had

paid the MR220,000 in person to Suppiah or that the money came out of Arul’s own

pocket. </p>
<p align="justify">166.    It is useful to set out the cross-examination on

what Arul knew before he signed Form 14A in July 1975:</p>
<blockquote>
<i><p align="justify">Q: In July 1975, you knew that you had not paid anything to Suppiah

  for the property?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Correct.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: You knew that Jaginder Singh had paid Tara?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes. </p>
<p align="justify">Q: So that when Suppiah appears on the register, as the purchaser for

  $220,000 from Tara, you knew that, that was not correct? I.e. Suppiah had not paid Tara,

  but Jaginder Singh had paid Tara?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Correct. Suppiah had not paid Tara but Jaginder Singh did pay.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: You knew that Jaginder Singh had paid for the property so that

  Suppiah and you were both his nominees or trustees?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Speaking for myself, I was a trustee or nominee for Jaginder Singh.

  I cannot speak for Suppiah.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: If Suppiah had not paid but Jaginder Singh paid Tara, and Suppiah

  was on the register, it could only be that Suppiah was there as an undisclosed trustee or

  nominee?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Disagree. Example, if Jaginder Singh pays Tara, but Suppiah wants to

  buy the property, then Suppiah goes on the register and what he will be doing is that he

  will owe Jaginder Singh the unpaid purchase price, in which event he would not be a

  trustee but a debtor to Jaginder Singh.</p>
<p align="justify">So if there is an agreement between Suppiah and Jaginder Singh, that

  Suppiah buys the property then at the time of the agreement and thereafter, Suppiah is no

  longer a trustee. He is the real owner but he owes money, unpaid purchase price to

  Jaginder Singh if he had not yet paid Jaginder Singh.</p>
<p align="justify">So if there is no agreement of that nature, then I agree that Suppiah

  is necessarily a trustee although his name is on the register because Suppiah never paid,

  but Jaginder Singh did. So Suppiah is the trustee of Jaginder Singh.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: In July 1975, when you were told that Jaginder Singh had paid for

  the property, were you told that there was an agreement between Suppiah and Jaginder Singh

  for Suppiah to buy the land from Jaginder Singh?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I was not told that there was such an agreement but that does not

  mean that there was no such agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">Q: When did you first learn of the alleged payment of the consideration

  by Jaginder Singh to Tara?</p>
<p align="justify">A: About the time I was asked to be a trustee, I knew that Jaginder

  Singh was buying the land but when he paid, I don’t know. He never told me when he

  paid for the land. </p>
<p align="justify">I was given in January 1977 documents, showing how the alleged payment

  of consideration to Tara was to be paid, which document was signed by Tara.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: If you were given the documents signed by Tara on 30 January 1977,

  it would not have shown that Jaginder Singh paid the consideration? Do you agree?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Of course I agree, as the document speaks for itself.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: When did you know that Jaginder Singh had paid the consideration to

  Tara?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I can’t remember.</p>
<p align="justify">Put: At the time Jaginder Singh asked you to become a trustee, you knew

  that Jaginder Singh had paid the consideration.</p>
<p align="justify">A: I did not know for a fact that Jaginder Singh had paid. I knew

  Jaginder Singh was paying. I knew of this (i.e. Jaginder was paying) in July 1975, when

  Jaginder Singh asked me to be a trustee. </p></i>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">167.    Despite the intense cross-examination by Mr

Cashin over several days, the plaintiff had consistently denied any detailed knowledge of

the earlier land transactions at the time when he signed Form 14 A. There is no evidence

led on whether the purported sale price of MR220,000 was at a gross undervalue, and if so,

whether the plaintiff was aware of that since that might give cause for some enquiry. The

valuation of the land at that time is not adduced in evidence. </p>
<p align="justify">168.    My overall impression is that Arul was simply

asked by Singh to be his trustee and he readily agreed without bothering to question Singh

on the complicated details. Arul was not privy to the complex transactions and payment

arrangements between Tara, Suppiah and Singh. Arul said he trusted Singh. Being trusting

is not being dishonest. Because Arul trusted his good friend, Singh, and had not asked him

questions does not mean that Singh could never have abused that trust. It is certainly not

a rarity for persons to be taken advantage of by their good friends, who sometimes

regrettably abuse the trust placed in them. </p>
<p align="justify">169.    Further, I cannot find any evidence, let alone

credible evidence, that Arul had colluded in some way with Suppiah and Singh, or that he

was involved with the meeting on 30 March 1974 in Tara’s house where it was alleged

that Suppiah or Singh fraudulently induced her to transfer her land to Suppiah for

MR220,000 and where she signed some documents effecting that transfer.</p>
<p align="justify">170.    The plaintiff did not hide his very close

relationship with Singh and Suppiah. He was forthright to admit that he knew Suppiah

personally for a very long time. They were in England together and did the post final law

course together. As far back as 1974, Singh, Suppiah and he were already very close

friends. The plaintiff said he was a member of the Royal Johore Golf Club and he used to

go up fairly often both on weekdays and weekends in the late 1970s to play, meet friends

and have dinners. At that time, Suppiah and Singh were his golfing partners and he would

meet them 3 to 4 times a month on a regular basis. Suppiah and Singh are also members of

the Singapore Island Country Club. So they do come down regularly to Singapore to play

golf together with Arul at the Singapore Island Country Club. This golfing with Suppiah

&amp; Singh would have started in the late 1960s and they are still golfing partners these

days. Their close relationship continues.</p>
<p align="justify">171.    Arul admits that they would from time to time

talk about the Tara matter. They had referred to the fact that she was claiming that he

was not a bona fide purchaser but he did not know of Tara’s stand at the time in May

1976 when she filed her defence to the possession action in Suit No. 146/1976 because he

had left it entirely to Suppiah to handle. But he certainly knew of her stand after he saw

Suppiah and Singh in Johore on 30 January 1977 to make enquiries on the Tara land

transaction. Arul made these enquiries because there was a serious partnership dispute in

M/s Rodyk &amp; Davidson at that time, and some of his partners accused him of being

involved in a scandalous land transaction in Johore. The plaintiff said in

cross-examination:<i></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: But there had been an earlier meeting, when you were told about the

  allegations to Coomaraswamy and that he was trying to expel you from the partnership?</p>
<p align="justify">A: On 15 January 1977, I had a meeting with Foo Yew Heng, P. Selvadurai

  and Tang See Chim (all partners in Rodyk). It was Selvadurai who told me that Coomaraswamy

  had accused me of being involved in some scandalous land transfer in Johore. That’s

  when I told them that I would go and find out and report back to the partners of Rodyk.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: …So after you met Jaginder Singh and Suppiah, and had been told

  of the history of the land transaction, I want to know whether they told you about the

  meeting at Tara’s house in Kulai on 30 March 1974, when a document was signed by her

  and that was the document which she said was the security, and Suppiah and Singh said

  ‘No, it was an outright transfer’? </p>
<p align="justify">A: What Suppiah and Jaginder Singh told me was that there was a

  transfer of land and they had one year in which a transfer would not be done or there was

  an option to repurchase, something like that. And they had registered the land in

  Suppiah’s name and before the transfer to my name as nominee, and since the occupants

  refused to vacate the land, they had to take action in Court for possession. They told me

  that she had put defences and there was nothing scandalous. They gave me copies of the

  Court Proceedings of S146/1976 for possession, which I gave to the partners.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Did they give you a copy of the transfer executed by Tara on 30

  March 1974?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No. I am almost certain they did not give me that.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: You therefore saw a copy of Tara’s defence in S146/76?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I think I did.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">Q: You therefore knew that she was challenging your title as being a

  registered proprietor and as a true owner?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: At a later stage, after you got possession, Tara first of all,

  appealed. Did you instruct your solicitors Suppiah &amp; Singh to oppose that appeal?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No. But it was implicit in my earlier instructions to Suppiah in

  person, that he takes instructions from my principal, Jaginder.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Therefore the solicitors, Suppiah &amp; Singh, took the stand on

  your behalf, to say or to deny Tara’s allegations that you were not a bona fide

  purchaser for value?</p>
<p align="justify">A: That is not correct, because first they did not take it on my

  behalf, but on behalf of my principal. Secondly, Suppiah &amp; Singh, did not say that I

  was a bona fide purchaser for value, at any stage of the proceedings either at the trial

  stage or at the appeal stage of this S146/76. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">172.    Through the cause papers given to him at that

meeting in Johore, Arul came to know that the purported date of registration of

Tara’s transfer to Suppiah was 22 July 1975, i.e. 8 days before the transfer from

Suppiah to him on 31 July 1975. But he stressed that he did not know of it at the time he

signed Form 14 A. When questioned why he did not find it peculiar or odd, he said that it

was a matter between Suppiah and Singh, his principal. He did not ask questions as he was

just a nominee. In any event, this was in January 1977. Much water had flowed under the

bridge. I cannot fault the plaintiff if he could not decide whether to believe Tara’s

version of events as to what had happened on 30 March 1974, or the version of Singh and

Suppiah. When he enquired from them in January 1977, the plaintiff was assured by Singh

and Suppiah that there was nothing scandalous. The plaintiff himself was not there in

Tara’s house and therefore, he would not know what exactly transpired and what

representations Singh and Suppiah had made to Tara. Even if Arul in good faith believed

the version rendered by his good friends over Tara’s version, can one regard Arul as

being dishonest? I think not. </p>
<p align="justify">173.    Now that matters had blown up and he had found

himself caught in between, Arul would have to decide what to do. The land was already

registered in his name. With the much greater background information he now has, I have to

ask myself the question whether he had henceforth acted honestly to extricate himself from

the situation he found himself in or did he thereafter act dishonestly or fraudulently to

assist his friends. I also have to bear in mind the fact that the plaintiff, as the

trustee, may have to take his principal’s instructions to challenge the entitlement

of Tara to remain in possession of the land, and sign the authorisation for the

beneficiaries’ lawyers to proceed with the claim. It may not be for the plaintiff to

judge whether to believe the claim of Singh or that of Tara. It may be wiser for the

trustee to leave that to the court. However, under no circumstances should Arul assist

Singh or Suppiah, by stating any false facts. In this case before me, I have tried but I

cannot find in any affidavit or evidence on oath, that the plaintiff had personally stated

that he was himself a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. Neither has any of the

defendant’s counsel shown me any affidavit or notes of evidence of Arul at the Johore

trial, or viva voce evidence before me that he had ever asserted that fact. </p>
<p align="justify">174.    The nearest to a denial of Tara’s assertion

that he was not a bona fide purchaser for value is the plaintiff’s affidavit at 5 ROP

1131 filed in Motion No 46 of 1977 and affirmed by him on 21 December 1977, where he

averred that ‘the allegations contained in the said Statutory Declaration [of Tara]

are not true to the knowledge of the deponent’. Tara’s statutory declaration at

5 ROP 1126 states <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. On the 30<sup>th</sup> day of March 1974….,I entered into a

  written agreement with one P. Suppiah, charging the said property by way of security in

  order to obtain a loan of $220,000/-</p>
<p align="justify">3. It was agreed that the said P. Suppiah would not sell the said

  property within one year of the transfer of the same unto his name. It was further agreed

  that my consent was necessary in the event of a sale by the said P. Suppiah. </p>
<p align="justify">4. In beach of the aforesaid and in violation of the entire security

  transaction … the said P. Suppiah registered the property in his name on the 21<sup>st</sup>

  August 1975.<i> </i>(Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">175.    I reviewed several times the plaintiff’s

explanation of his denial of Tara’s allegations in particular her allegation that

Suppiah purportedly sold and transferred the land to the plaintiff. See Notes of Evidence

at pages 104 to 112 and 130 to 132. The plaintiff said that he did not direct his mind to

the phrase ‘purported to sell’. I note that Tara did not specifically assert

that Arul was not a bona fide purchaser for value in her Statutory Declaration. The

affidavit was not drafted by the plaintiff personally but by Suppiah. This affidavit of

the plaintiff was affirmed in December 1977, long after he had already made known to some

of his partners in M/s Rodyk &amp; Davidson that he did not pay for the property. In the

circumstances, I give the plaintiff the benefit of doubt that he did not address his mind

to the imputation contained in that phrase ‘purported to sell’ when he was

reading his affidavit before affirming it. The plaintiff’s denial of Tara’s

allegations is akin to a general traverse but with no specific denial of each and every

separate allegation contained in every sentence of Tara’s Statutory Declaration. If

the plaintiff meant to assert that the allegation in paragraph 4 was untrue in that there

was no breach and violation of the entire security transaction by Suppiah, which was the

crux of the issue in Tara’s case, then I can understand why he somehow failed to

address his mind to the subsequent words ‘purported to sell…to Arul

Chandran’. Based on what he heard from Suppiah and Singh, I cannot say that the

plaintiff was dishonest when he chose to disbelieve Tara’s version of the events of

30 March 1974 and to believe what Suppiah and Singh had told him instead, which was the

basis for affirming that Tara’s allegations were not true to his knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify">176.    More importantly, when Arul testified at the

trial in S284/79 before Justice Abdul Razak, he gave truthful evidence that he was not a

bona fide purchaser for value and that he was merely a trustee for Singh. Had he lied on

oath that he was a bona fide purchaser for value in order to help Singh and Suppiah, it

would have been a different matter entirely. </p>
<p align="justify">177.    Sometime in May 1978, Arul transferred the land

to Jet Age Construction Sdn. Bhd. by way of another Form 14 A at the instruction of Singh,

his principal, at a consideration stated therein of MR 361,114. Arul, as the trustee,

cannot receive payment for his own account. Singh told Arul that Jet Age would be doing

the development. Arul did not find this unusual because land development is usually not

done by individuals in their own name, but by individuals forming a limited company to do

it. Since Singh had told him that the company was his, Arul thus left it to Singh to

handle the payment between his company and himself. Singh did not give Arul any details on

the payments and the transactions. There is no evidence adduced whether the company had in

fact reimbursed Singh for MR 361,114. I cannot read much into the acknowledgment of

receipt of the consideration by the plaintiff when in fact he had not personally received

any consideration. Again, there can be many ways by which Jet Age can make payment to

Singh. For instance, if Singh allows a set off against loans taken by him from his

company, one cannot say that no consideration has passed and that no payment has therefore

been made. Arul as the trustee need not invariably have to accept a physical payment on

behalf of his beneficiary, since the beneficiary can also choose to be paid directly in

cash or in kind. </p>
<p align="justify">178.    In the ultimate analysis, the defendant’s

case appears to me to rest largely on unsubstantiated assertions of fact, tenuous

circumstantial evidence and inferences. Counsel appears to suggest that the plaintiff is a

most dangerous and vicious fraud because he had not been forthright to admit at the outset

that he was not a bona fide purchaser for value when Tara instituted various court

proceedings in Johore. I will briefly set out below counsel’s arguments first and

then follow on with my own views in square brackets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The plaintiff is a very close friend of Singh and Suppiah, and

  hence, the plaintiff would know what had taken place on 30 March 1974 in Tara’s house

  before he signed Form 14 A on 31 July 1975. Considering their long friendship, and the

  fact they are all lawyers, it is hard to believe that the plaintiff was not kept in the

  picture constantly by Suppiah and Singh. It is submitted that this aspect of their

  relationship gives rise to the possibility, even probability, of collusion. Each party had

  to rely on the other two and the plaintiff had to adopt his stand of complete ignorance

  even to the extent of seeming at times to be an idiot or an imbecile. <br/>

  [I think one has to be cognizant of the very real possibility of Singh and Suppiah keeping

  the plaintiff largely in the dark as to what was happening. It may well be rude for the

  plaintiff to be overly inquisitive of the personal investment matters of Singh and

  Suppiah. On the other hand, Singh and Suppiah might not want the plaintiff to know too

  many details, and this is all the more so, if Singh and Suppiah indeed had been less than

  honest with their own dealings with Tara. When the plaintiff went to see Singh and Suppiah

  on 30 January 1977, I am not surprised if they painted an honest picture of their dealing

  with Tara for the plaintiff’s consumption.]</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The plaintiff as a lawyer would not have agreed to become a trustee

  without making full enquiry of the facts.<br/>

  [This is not necessarily true especially when the other party is a close friend and a

  great deal of trust may already exist.] </p>
<p align="justify">(c) The plaintiff had knowledge of the prior transactions before he

  signed Form 14 A.<br/>

  [This is an unsubstantiated assertion.] </p>
<p align="justify">(d) Counsel for the defendant further submitted that the plaintiff was

  intimately concerned with the whole transaction. The transfer to him was the final step to

  block Tara from regaining possession of her property as the plaintiff was setting himself

  up as a bona fide purchase for value without notice. That was why he had to keep Singh off

  the register and make it seem that he knew nothing of the many matters handled by Suppiah.

  If he knew about them, he could not claim that he had no notice. It is impossible to

  believe that he, a lawyer, would be so irresponsible as to allow the use of his name in so

  many actions without knowing about them or being told after the matter was finished what

  had happened.<br/>

  [The fundamental premise that the plaintiff was intimately concerned with the whole

  transaction is not borne out by the admissible evidence. The most important transaction

  seems to be on 30 March 1974. If indeed the plaintiff was so involved with the rest, I

  wonder why he was not also present at Tara’s house together with Singh and Suppiah on

  that day. Since there was no monetary gain whatsoever in this for the plaintiff, I am very

  surprised that the plaintiff would be willing to soil his hands and risk ruining his

  reputation purely on account of their close friendship, had he known as a fact that Singh

  and Suppiah had fraudulently misrepresented the true nature of the transfer to Tara.]</p>
<p align="justify">(e) The absence of a qualification on the land register that the

  plaintiff was a mere trustee meant that the plaintiff was in law the legal and beneficial

  owner.<br/>

  [But the defendant failed to call an expert witness on Malaysian land law to testify to

  that. I cannot say whether a proprietor appearing on the land register must be deemed to

  be a bona fide purchaser for value and whether a trustee, as the bare legal owner, is

  prohibited under the Code from registering himself as the proprietor, unless he registers

  a qualification to the effect that he is a mere trustee. Consequently, it is difficult to

  infer any dishonesty on the plaintiff’s part when he allowed himself to be the

  registered proprietor when in fact he was only a trustee for Singh.]</p>
<p align="justify">(f) By going on the land register unqualified, counsel submitted that

  the plaintiff had held himself out as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice

  although Tara had, in many of the actions, claimed repeatedly that he was not. Since

  Suppiah was not paid any consideration and therefore could not have received the MR220,000

  he claimed he did in the Form 14A, it was submitted that the entire transaction was a sham

  or a fake. The first transfer from Tara to Suppiah was also a sham or a fake because Singh

  had paid Tara and not Suppiah. </p>
<p align="justify">[As explained before, there are various ways by which payment can be

  made. The fact that the plaintiff, who was fronting for Singh, did not physically hand

  over the MR220,000 to Suppiah at the time of the land transfer to the plaintiff, does not

  mean that Singh could never pay for the land without first going through the trustee.

  There was no reason for the plaintiff to desire an involvement in the physical mechanics

  of the payment. Lending his name as trustee was troublesome enough. Further, there is no

  evidence of what the actual payment arrangements to Tara were when she purportedly sold

  her land, and whether the funds to pay her originated from Singh or Suppiah or both of

  them. Apparently, the plaintiff had understood that Suppiah initially bought the land from

  Tara, and later on changed his mind. It is not clear if Suppiah had borrowed money from

  Singh to finance his purported purchase from Tara, and later Singh agreed to take over the

  purchase by buying the land over from Suppiah. When exactly Singh took over the purchase

  was not clear to Arul. The plaintiff himself could not enlighten the court as he did not

  know what the arrangements between Suppiah and Singh were at that time. Whether the

  payment to Suppiah was through actual payments or set-offs against outstanding monies owed

  by him is also not clear. In any event, I do not think that it is an irresistible

  inference that the said transfer Form 14A must necessarily be a sham, or that it was

  unreasonable for the plaintiff to suppose that no consideration of MR 220,000 could

  possibly have passed from Singh to Suppiah, such that the plaintiff must have known at

  that time that he was going to be a party to a sham transaction. Let me assume for the

  moment that Suppiah had initially purchased the land from Tara for MR220,000. Let me

  further assume that Suppiah borrowed MR220,000 from Singh to finance his purchase and

  Suppiah paid it over to Tara. Tara then transferred the land to Suppiah. When Singh

  decided to buy over the land from Suppiah at the same price of MR 220,000, he asked the

  plaintiff to act as his trustee. The plaintiff signed the Form 14A to accept the transfer

  from Suppiah. The consideration stated was MR220,000. Because Suppiah owed Singh

  MR220,000, Singh could certainly effect payment of MR220,000 to Suppiah by way of a

  set-off of the unpaid loan of the same amount taken earlier from Singh by Suppiah. No

  physical movement of money need take place and yet it would not be incorrect to state that

  there was consideration of MR220,000 received by Suppiah from Singh through a set-off. The

  defendant here faced the hurdle of proving the basic background facts without calling any

  witnesses who might have some knowledge of them. The plaintiff was not going to make it

  any easier for him. For instance, the plaintiff was very quick to state that he had no

  personal knowledge when Mr Cashin tried to get the plaintiff to admit to certain

  ‘undisputed background facts’ referred to in the various judgments.]</p>
<p align="justify">(g) Finally, defendant’s counsel submitted that the transfer by

  the plaintiff to Jet Age Construction Sdn. Bhd., a company controlled by Singh, was

  another sham or fake, as no consideration was received by the plaintiff. The transfer was

  to prevent Tara from recovering her land. <br/>

  [I have explained before why not much significance can be attached to this transaction. I

  cannot infer any dishonesty in the plaintiff if he genuinely trusted Singh to settle the

  payments in whatever mode he deemed fit with a company controlled by himself. Whether

  Singh did so or not is another matter. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the

  plaintiff knew at the time he transferred the land to Jet Age Construction Sdn. Bhd. that

  it would be a sham transaction between Singh and his company, and that the purpose of the

  transfer is to defeat Tara’s claim. How it would help to defeat Tara’s claim is

  unclear to me. I would have thought that returning the land to the control of Singh would

  make it easier for Tara to succeed in tracing it back to the alleged perpetrator should

  she succeed in her claim against Singh. Equity would readily assist her to trace her land

  back to the constructive trustee, Jet Age, which in turn was controlled by the alleged

  perpetrator i.e. Singh.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">179.    On the fundamental question whether Arul acted

in collusion with Singh and Suppiah, and whether he had been fraudulent and dishonest when

he signed the Form 14A, it is of no consequence if Arul’s knowledge of the history of

the transactions came from what Singh or Suppiah had told him or through documents shown

to and read by him, so long as Arul believed it and/or had acted on the basis that the

information was correct. A man’s conduct and actions must be guided by what is known

to him. He may rely on and act on hearsay information. Evidence on what Arul had been told

by Suppiah and Singh prior to signing Form 14 A constitutes admissible evidence to prove

the state of Arul’s knowledge at the material time when he signed From 14A. His

knowledge at that time is a question of fact.</p>
<p align="justify">180.    In his submissions, defendant’s counsel

accepts that the plaintiff had consistently said that he had not given instructions on

various matters concerning the action in his name to claim vacant possession of the land

from Tara. His beneficiary, Singh, did so. Defendant’s counsel also accepts that the

plaintiff had consistently maintained his position that he was not informed either of the

impending court actions or their results until 31 January 1977, when he had to see Suppiah

and Singh in Johore to find out what was happening after some of the plaintiff’s then

partners in M/s Rodyk &amp; Davidson had accused him of some scandalous land dealings in

Johore. That was the 1<sup>st</sup> time that the plaintiff read and saw Tara’s

defence in Civil Suit 146 of 1976, where Tara contended that the transfer of the land from

Suppiah to the plaintiff was not for value and that the plaintiff was not a bona fide

purchaser. Besides setting out some of the history of the transaction, Tara had also in

her defence put Arul to strict proof that he was a bona fide purchaser of the land for

value. There was no reply filed in this action specifically to deny that Arul was a bona

fide purchaser for value.</p>
<p align="justify">181.    At best for the defendant, we have the

plaintiff’s admission that he learnt of some history of the land transaction from the

documents and the defence shown to him in January 1977. But I cannot see how this helps

the defendant when what I have to consider is the plaintiff’s knowledge on 31 July

1975, and not his state of knowledge in January 1977, some 1  years later, which is

totally irrelevant to the question whether the plaintiff acted dishonestly and

fraudulently when he signed Form 14 A. </p>
<i><b>
<p>Replies to Law Society</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">182.    A complaint to the Law Society was made against

the plaintiff. A considerable amount of cross-examination was taken up on the

plaintiff’s replies in April to the Law Society to show that he had not been

forthright and that he had in fact been dishonest.</p>
<p align="justify">183.    The complaint stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that

Arul was not possessed of funds that would have enabled him to buy the land for MR220,000.

Arul’s reply was that the complainants were not in a position to know of his

financial standing and their speculation whether he was an actual purchaser was unfounded

and malicious, to say the least. Does this mean that he was indeed possessed of the funds

and he had used his own funds to buy the land, or does it mean that he did not in fact use

his own funds, but it was merely malicious to say that he did not have the financial

resources of that amount <i>per se</i>? To a question ‘Looking at the transcript of

the meetings with Arul it becomes clear that Arul in fact did not provide the

consideration. Who did?’, Arul’s answer was, ‘It is up to me to find the

financing in any way open to me within the law.’ Does it mean then that he paid for

the land himself, or that he did not provide the consideration but he managed to find

someone else to finance him, or that he managed to find someone else to buy the land and

pay for it but he himself never bought the land and never paid for it. Another example is

the plaintiff’s reply to the query why he did not view the property to which the

plaintiff’s answer was "I do not know how they have come to the conclusion that

I did not view the property." Does it mean that he did in fact view the property when

he had not in fact viewed the property, or merely that he did not know how the

complainants managed to find out the truth that he did not view the property. </p>
<p align="justify">184.    The plaintiff explained that he answered in that

manner because he was going to appear before the Law Society and he would tell them

clearly that he was only a trustee and that he did not pay for the land. Since he believed

that a copy of his reply to the Law Society would likely be extended to the complainants,

Mr S K Tan and Mr Coomaraswamy, whom he believed were conspiring to throw him out of M/s

Rodyk &amp; Davidson, and were working hand in glove with Tara, he did not want them to

feed back to Tara the information that he was a mere trustee for the land and that he had

not paid anything personally for the transfer of the land to him from Suppiah. As with

Singh and Suppiah, Arul wanted to put Tara to strict proof of something which they already

knew to be true.</p>
<p align="justify">185.    In my opinion, the plaintiff had been slippery

with his replies to the Law Society. He made no positive assertion that he was the

beneficial owner of the land and that he had paid valuable consideration for it. As he had

every intention to tell the Law Society the true state of affairs which the plaintiff said

he did, I cannot conclude that he had intended to mislead and deceive the Law Society. I

note that the plaintiff had by then also informed some of his other partners in a meeting

as early as February 1997 that he did not furnish the MR220,000 for the purchase and that

he was in fact holding the property ‘in a manner of speaking’ for a third party.

This was recorded in a minutes of meeting, which minutes the plaintiff did not generally

disagree with. This lends support to the plaintiff’s evidence that he did disclose to

the Law Society that he was not a bona fide purchaser for value just as he had disclosed

the same to some of his other partners. </p>
<p align="justify">186.    As for the complainants and Tara, he was not

going to tell them that he was not a bona fide purchaser for value. As explained earlier,

he believed that the complainants were his enemies who had an ulterior motive and were out

to do him harm out of spite. It was in that context that he fashioned his answers in that

evasive and equivocal manner because he believed that a copy of his replies would

eventually be given to the complainants by the Law Society, and they would in turn pass it

to Tara or her solicitors. The plaintiff said that he was not going to give them the

information they were seeking in a devious and dishonest manner. </p>
<p align="justify">187.    In the circumstances, I do not think that I can

infer that the plaintiff is a vicious and dangerous fraud having regard to the bitter

partnership manoeuvres he found himself in, and the restraint placed on him by joining his

defence with Suppiah and Singh, where they had put Tara to strict proof that the plaintiff

was not a bona fide purchaser for value. He might not have wanted to compromise their

legal defence. Whether that is the proper way to defend their action is quite another

question. But I do not think it would be proper to make a finding of fraud or dishonesty

for these reasons alone.</p>
<p align="justify">188.    In any event, the plaintiff’s replies to

the Law Society have not been included in the particulars in the defendant’s plea of

justification. As such, the defendant cannot rely on the same for his plea. <i><b></b></i></p>
<p>Effect of Pleadings</p>
<p align="justify">189.    Generally, parties should properly admit to

facts put into issue and which they are know are factually true and correct. Although a

defendant is entitled to put the plaintiff to strict proof of his whole case, a party

generally should not strictly put the other party to prove facts that he already knows to

be true. If that practice is adhered to, then all parties including the courts will not

only save a lot of time and unnecessary costs, but more importantly it will further the

proper administration of justice and the just resolution of the real dispute at hand. It

is quite different if the party requiring the strict proof does not know the true

position, and the facts alleged are wholly within the possession and knowledge of the

other party. </p>
<p align="justify">190.    However, it cannot be said that the party

requiring strict proof of a fact which he already knows to be true, has acted dishonestly

or fraudulently in any way. That will be going much too far because I recognize that there

can be occasions where a party puts in issue a fact where there is no real dispute (a) to

force the other party to bring in a particular witness, thus opening up an avenue to

cross-examine on other matters, or (b) to force a lacuna in the proof of his

opponent’s case when he knows that the witness testifying to that fact is unavailable

or not found. </p>
<p align="justify">191.    There is a distinct difference between a denial

and a non-admission by a defendant’s traverse of the allegations of fact made by a

plaintiff in his statement of claim. Generally, where the defendant denies an alleged

fact, he cannot call evidence to prove facts to the contrary without first setting out in

his defence what his positive case to the contrary is. </p>
<p align="justify">192.    An allegation of fact may contain two or more

allegations. For instance, paragraph 12a of Tara’s statement of claim in S284/1979

states the particulars of fraud of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, Arul, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. colluding with the First and Second Defendants [i.e. Suppiah and

  Singh respectively] and causing the said property to be registered into his name,</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) with knowledge of the real arrangement between the Plaintiff [i.e.

    Tara] and the First and Second Defendants;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) with knowledge that under the terms of the said arrangement it was

    unlawful or inequitable on the part of the First and Second Defendants to have transferred

    and registered the said property into the name of the Second Defendant;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iii) with knowledge that he was not a bona fide purchaser of the said

    property for value; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iv) with knowledge that he was accepting the transfer of the said

    property into his name only as the nominee or agent of the First and Second Defendants and

    only for the purposes of posing and projecting himself as a bona fide purchaser for value

    so as to attempt to defeat the Plaintiff’s right to redeem and recover the said

    property.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">193.    Taking paragraph a. read with (iii) for

instance. There is the allegation that the plaintiff had colluded with Suppiah and Singh.

There is also the allegation that the plaintiff was not a bona fide purchaser for value

and they all knew that as a fact. There can be a factual situation where Arul knows that

he is not a bona fide purchaser for value but he nevertheless denies that he had colluded

with Suppiah and Singh. If so, then he should not deny each and every allegation, which

amounts to denying both allegations separately and also as a whole. Where the separate

allegations of fact are very material, the observance of this rule becomes particularly

important so that all the critical issues in dispute will be properly and correctly

crystallized. </p>
<p align="justify">194.    Counsel for the defendant places emphasis on

paragraph 22 of the joint defence, where all 3 defendants, Suppiah, Singh and Arul, had

denied each and every allegation contained in paragraph 12 of Tara’s statement of

claim. Paragraph 12 is a very long paragraph of some 5 pages with many sub-paragraphs and

contains numerous allegations of fact embedded in long sentences. It seems to me to be an

easy way out to use a ‘catch all’ traverse and denial of that long paragraph 12,

which might have been done without much thought. Paragraph 22 of the joint defence simply

reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">22. The Defendants [i.e. Suppiah, Singh and Arul]….. deny each and

  every allegation contained in paragraph 12 of the Statement of Claim, including the

  allegations of fraud, and the Defendants put the Plaintiff [i.e. Tara] to strict proof

  thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">195.    A general traverse, such as that above, means

that each and every separate allegation is denied. It extends to every allegation

contained in every long sentence in paragraph 12 of the claim, broken up into all its

constituent parts. Generally, it does not admit of the possibility that the defendant is

denying one part of the allegation of fact and admitting another. All allegations of fact

embedded therein must be construed as having been being separately denied.</p>
<p align="justify">196.    Strictly speaking therefore, the general

traverse at paragraph 22 includes a denial by all three defendants, that Arul was not a

bona fide purchaser for value, which must mean that he was a bona fide purchaser for

value. If Arul intended to deny the other allegations but not this, then his denial of

each and every separate allegation was not only inaccurate but would be regarded as

misleading and evasive.</p>
<p align="justify">197.    Arul disagreed that in paragraph 22 of the joint

defence he was denying that he was not a bona fide purchaser. He maintained that he was

denying the total allegation that he had colluded with Suppiah and Singh to cause the

property to be registered in his name with the knowledge that he was not a bona fide

purchaser for value. According to Arul, it meant that he was denying the collusion and the

associated implication that one cannot register property in one’s name if one is not

a bona fide purchaser for value, which was tied up with the accusation of collusion. </p>
<p align="justify">198.    I note that the plaintiff had not seen the joint

defence before it was filed in court. He never drafted it. He only saw it much later in

May or June 1981. Having read it when he got the bundle of pleadings when they were

getting ready to go for trial, he agreed with it. He adopted it as his joint defence

together with Suppiah and Singh, as it was drafted by Suppiah, an experienced lawyer with

the same seniority as himself.</p>
<p align="justify">199.    M/s Suppiah &amp; Singh were his solicitors

initially. They handled matters for all 3 defendants in S284/79. He basically left it to

Suppiah who did everything for him and Singh. Arul explained that he had a busy practice

in Singapore. By 1977, he was not doing any work in Malaysia because he had started a new

firm in Singapore in August 1977. Some time before the trial, Suppiah appointed Mr Chin,

the Senior Partner of M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill on Arul’s behalf and Mr Chin became

his solicitor on record. On the 2nd day of the trial on 13 August 1981, Mr Chin informed

the judge that Arul wished to act on his own behalf. On 17 October 1981, Mr Ronald Khoo

took over and acted for Arul. His new solicitor was not happy with the joint defence. Mr

Khoo took the view that they should make it clearer to the court that he was merely a

trustee or nominee. </p>
<p align="justify">200.    On the very next day, 18 October 1981, which was

already the 7th day of the trial, an amended and separate defence was tendered before the

court, with no objections from the parties including Tara. This time Arul clarified in his

amended defence in no uncertain terms that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. Prior to July 1975, he had not heard of the property, Tara or

  anything else about the transaction;</p>
<p align="justify">b. He had made no representations to Tara and had never met her in

  fact; </p>
<p align="justify">c. In July 1975, Singh requested him to be his nominee and trustee;</p>
<p align="justify">d. Singh paid for the whole consideration for the property;</p>
<p align="justify">e. He had never seen the property and has no beneficial interest in it.</p>
<p align="justify">f. He only came to know of the background to the property after 15

  January 1977.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>g. He had not assisted Singh or Suppiah in any breach of agreement, fraud, undue

  influence or breach of trust as pleaded or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">201.    I do not find anything sinister in Arul

following his solicitor’s advice to amend his defence. In fact, the plaintiff frankly

admitted that he was happy with the original defence as it was but it was Dato Khoo who

wanted to amend it and he basically followed his counsel’s advice. I believe the

plaintiff’s evidence that he would leave matters in his solicitor’s hands when

he is comfortable with the solicitor’s competency. He agreed with Dato Khoo’s

stand that his amended defence would shorten the trial. </p>
<p align="justify">202.    To properly understand Arul’s mental state

at that time, I will set out this part of his evidence: </p>
<blockquote>
<i><p align="justify">Q : It was not until the Thursday of the trial, in Johore Bahru,

  that you at last admitted the truth that you were not a bona fide purchase for value?</p>
<p align="justify">A : I never said I was a bona fide purchaser for value at any time. In

  the amended defence it made no difference to that position. </p>
<p align="justify">Q : Why did you amend your defence?</p>
<p align="justify">A : While this case was going on, it was played up in the press in

  Malaysia and Ronald Khoo, a close friend of mine for a long time and a senior partner of

  Shearn &amp; Delamore, telephoned me to say, that the way things were going, with that

  Judge and Mr Cashin, he should come down and appear on my behalf. I agreed.</p>
<p align="justify">He came down. We discussed the case. And he took the view that since I

  was going to state all this in my evidence, we ought to amend the defence and file a

  separate defence on my behalf. That was why my defence was amended. </p>
<p align="justify">Court : Before Ronald Khoo came down, you must have read the unamended

  defence?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Court : When can you recall, you first read that unamended defence?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Can’t recall exactly, but it was before the trial. I might

  have seen it soon after it was filed.</p>
<p align="justify">Court : Did you adopt that after you had seen it and you were satisfied

  with it?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes. It was drafted by Suppiah, an experienced lawyer with the same

  seniority as myself.</p>
<p align="justify">Court : So therefore, you agreed to whatever was there?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Court : So it was when Ronald took over and upon his advice, you

  decided to change your earlier position taken in that earlier defence to another position

  taken in the amended defence? </p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes but I would not take it as another position because it was

  merely clarifying my stand in the earlier defence.</p>
<p align="justify">Court : Therefore if it was merely a clarification, then the later

  amended defence would not be inconsistent with the earlier defence? Is that so?</p>
<p align="justify">A : That is correct.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : In the earlier defence, there was no mention at all that you were a

  trustee or nominee?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : What there was in, in the statement of claim, was a repetition of

  the stand that Tara had adopted and taken from the very 1<sup>st</sup> time when you

  claimed possession, namely that you were not a bona fide purchase for value?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes, she took that position but as I said it was irrelevant to the

  issues in the case.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : In your original defence, you never said that you were a trustee?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : Then, why was it not necessary now, for her to have to prove that

  you were not a bona fide purchaser for value in your later position taken in the amended

  defence?</p>
<p align="justify">A : I was going to give evidence on it anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : Did Jaginder Singh and Suppiah know that you were going to give

  evidence that you were a trustee before the amendments?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes, from the start of the case, they knew it. From the time in

  1977, when I went to the Law Society, Suppiah and Jaginder Singh knew that I was going to

  say that I was a trustee or a nominee.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : So that all 3 of you took the same stand, namely if Tara says that

  you were not a bona fide purchaser for value, Tara is to prove it?</p>
<p align="justify">A : Yes. The original defence showed it. </p>
<p align="justify">Q : Then why was it when Tara’s statement of claim was filed on 30

  August 1979, you all decided to put her to the proof, although they knew, according to

  what you say, you were going to admit that you were a trustee when you gave evidence? </p>
<p align="justify">A : I can’t explain why. Suppiah drafted the defence. Suppiah on

  our behalf in the defence, was putting her to strict proof which is not in any way unusual

  in pleaded cases.</p>
<p align="justify">Court : Tell me, if at the time of the Law Society complaint, you,

  Suppiah and Jaginder Singh, knew that you were going to admit that you were a mere trustee

  and imply that you were not a bona fide purchaser for value, then why did you draft the

  answers to the complaint to the Law Society in a way, as you say, not to reveal those

  facts to them?</p>
<p>A : It was the mood and the atmosphere existing with M. Coomaraswamy and S K Tan and Mr

  Cashin hovering around and being hustled. It was meant not to be a public document and

  just my reply to my Law Society.</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">203.    Having regard to the circumstances and after a

careful analysis of the admissible evidence before me, I find it difficult to infer the

existence of a fraudulent or dishonest intent on the part of the plaintiff merely from

having adopted paragraph 22, which is a rather short paragraph out of 19 pages of the

joint defence, although that paragraph 22 may be criticized as a bad pleading point, for

which it is unclear who might be responsible and whether the solicitor-in-charge was aware

of the need to be more precise in traversing a pleading after having taken proper and

detailed instructions. Of course, if the defendant personally instructed his solicitor to

craft it in that way to deliberately make it ambiguous and to mislead, some comment on

that conduct as being somewhat devious or dishonest may be called for. But there is

insufficient evidence of that before me. </p>
<p align="justify">204.    A traverse by denial of a negative averment may

simply remain as a mere denial with nothing to be implied and as a consequence, the

defendant will not be allowed at the trial to call evidence and set up in his defence an

affirmative case to the contrary, which has not been specifically pleaded. Essentially,

the defendant by such a mere denial would be simply putting the plaintiff to strict proof.

But in certain cases, the double negative contains within itself an affirmative

allegation. This is the ‘pregnant negative’, which clearly imports a positive

assertion of fact, where particulars may be ordered, if not so given. The third

possibility is that the matter is left in doubt in which case the pleading may be struck

out as being embarrassing unless made clearer by an amendment. </p>
<p align="justify">205.    According to Arul, Tara’s solicitors never

asked for further and better particulars nor delivered any interrogatories, implying that

it could have made it clearer what exactly the 3 defendants were denying. Arul then said

that he nevertheless did disclose the facts that he knew by way of his amended defence. In

any event, even if there was no amended defence, he maintained that if the question was

asked of him in court whether he was a bona fide purchaser for value, he would state

exactly the truth, although there was no obligation to disclose in his defence that he was

only a trustee or nominee. He asserted that ‘we must tell the court the truth under

any circumstances.’</p>
<p align="justify">206.    I am inclined to believe the plaintiff here

because he had very early on in February 1977, already disclosed to some of his partners

that he did not personally pay for the property when he came on the register. He had also

disclosed the same to the Law Society. He had prior to his giving evidence at the trial,

tendered an amended defence, to state unequivocally that he never paid for the property

but was merely a trustee or nominee. I therefore conclude that tendering his amended

defence on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the trial does not <i>per se</i> indicate that he had

been dishonest in his conduct of his earlier joint defence, or that he had all along

intended to deceive the trial judge but somehow, had a change of heart when he was about

to testify. </p>
<p align="justify">207.    I observe that defendant’s counsel had

relied heavily on certain averments in Arul’s pleadings in the various actions in

Johore. But it must be remembered that pleadings are drafted by lawyers usually on

client’s instructions, and may be amended. Pleadings are not testimony on oath in

court or an affirmation of facts on affidavit. It is thus difficult to pin the plaintiff

down on a mere general traverse of a pregnant averment, that he had thus by way of the

pleadings positively alleged a fact known to him to be false and therefore, he was

dishonest and a most vicious and dangerous fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">208.    The fact that Mr Justice Syed Othman presumed

that the plaintiff was a bona fide purchaser for value and found in favour of the

plaintiff in an action in the name of the plaintiff to evict Tara from the land and to

remove a caveat lodged on the land by her, did not necessarily mean that the plaintiff had

in fact asserted that fact in court. Did he mislead the court? I considered the fact that

the matter was argued by their lawyer, Mr Suppiah of M/s Suppiah and Singh. It was not the

plaintiff arguing. The plaintiff said he was not even there at the hearing. He left it to

Suppiah, and to Singh, his principal who was giving instructions to Suppiah. If Suppiah in

his submissions had misled the court into making that presumption, there was therefore the

real possibility that he was not acting under instructions of the plaintiff. I cannot

disregard the possibility of Suppiah and Singh acting on their own without the

plaintiff’s knowledge and consent. </p>
<p align="justify">209.    The fact that Mr Justice Syed Othman had to

presume that fact, seems to support the contention that no positive assertion of that fact

had been made.<i><b></b></i></p>
<p>Foreign Law</p>
<p align="justify">210.    Apart from certain exceptions, foreign law must

be proved as a fact by the party relying on it. No expert witnesses appeared to tender the

National Land Code and to give expert evidence on sections 342, 344 and by contrast,

section 346 of the Code. </p>
<p align="justify">211.    Therefore, no evidence is led as to whether:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) a nominee/trustee of a property must be expressly registered as

  such;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) a registered owner is deemed to be a bona fide purchaser for value

  without notice and is a representation to the world at large that he is never a

  nominee/trustee but he is always both a legal and beneficial owner;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) a registration by a nominee/trustee as a transferee and as a

  registered owner is <i>per se</i> fraudulent;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">212.    Without the assistance of expert evidence, I

cannot infer that the plaintiff, as a mere trustee had done anything dishonest or improper

by having himself registered as the proprietor on the register. I cannot say he had

misrepresented himself to the world at large that he is both the legal and beneficial

owner when he is only a trustee. In the absence of any expert evidence on the National

Land Code, I will assume that a registered proprietor can be a bare legal owner or a

trustee for someone else. </p>
<p align="justify">213.    The burden is on the defendant to establish with

a high degree of proof that the plaintiff was then and is still a most vicious and

dangerous fraud. I find that he failed to prove either. It might have helped the

defendant’s case if the defendant’s counsel is able to adduce expert evidence

that a mere trustee of land in Malaysia cannot be registered as the proprietor under the

National Land Code. But counsel chose not to despite my indications to them on the need

for proof of Malaysian land law and I am left with nothing much to come to any clear

conclusion and to satisfy myself that he is indeed such a vicious and dangerous fraud. <i><b></b></i></p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p align="justify">214.    In conclusion, having regard to the requisite

standard of proof, I am not able to infer from very limited and tenuous circumstantial

evidence, that the plaintiff had, subsequent to the events of 30 March 1974, colluded with

Suppiah and Singh to put the land out of reach of Tara by agreeing to stand in as a

purported bona fide purchaser for value in July 1975, and by signing the Form 14A to allow

the land to be transferred into his name as the registered proprietor, and by holding

himself out as the beneficial and legal owner of the land, when in truth he was merely

holding the land on trust for Singh.</p>
<p align="justify">215.    Even if one were to go further to infer that the

plaintiff was negligent in being too trusting, simply careless or less than

straightforward by not admitting at the outset of court proceedings in Johore that he was

not a bona fide purchaser for value, in my judgment that does not amount to fraudulent

conduct, let alone conduct justifying that the plaintiff is a most vicious and dangerous

fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">216.    In addition, I find that the defendant failed to

prove that the plaintiff had dishonestly concealed information with regard to the Johore

proceedings prior to offering himself for election to office at the Club. From the

plaintiff’s perspective, both his appeals were allowed. It is also not unreasonable

for him to believe that the Privy Council had fully exonerated him on the merits after a

review of the evidence in the Tara case when their Lordships held that ‘it is <u><b>abundantly

plain</b></u> that he (i.e. Arul) had no hand whatever in the events of March 30, 1974,

which form the basis of the respondent’s case of fraud against the other

appellants.’ </p>
<p align="justify">217.    Hence, Arul would naturally conclude that he is

not guilty of what Abdul Razak J said he had done. I cannot say that he is dishonest to

hold that view, which is not an unreasonable view to take. Even among lawyers, one can get

different views of the consequences of an appeal allowed by consent. Whether Arul’s

personal view is correct in law is quite another matter. Consequently, I cannot infer any

dishonest intention on his part when he did not make any disclosure to the Club or the GC

members of the old Johore matter. </p>
<p align="justify">218.    In the result, it is my judgment that none of

the defamatory meanings nor the stings in the defamatory meanings have been justified by

the defendant to the requisite degree of proof called for in such serious attacks on the

plaintiff’s character and reputation. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Public Policy against dredging up the past</p></b>
<p align="justify">219.    As an additional bow to the string in the

plaintiff’s case, counsel for Arul submitted that even if the defendant succeeds in

his justification defence, public policy dictates that the defendant should not be allowed

to dredge up the plaintiff’s long buried past and the defendant should still be made

liable for the defamatory statements. In view of my finding above, it is strictly not

necessary for me to address this point. Since there are detailed submissions on this, I

will express my views.</p>
<p align="justify">220.    In <i>Leyman v Latimer &amp; Others</i>

[1874-80] All E.R. Rep. 1264, the plaintiff, a newspaper editor, was called "a

convicted felon" and "a felon editor" by the defendant, who pleaded

justification. At the court below, the trial judge, Blackburn J. found that the plaintiff

had in fact been convicted many years previously of felony and was sentenced to 12

months’ hard labour. He had served the sentence. At the Court of Appeal, Bret L.J.

with whom Cotton LJ agreed said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The libels set out in the pleadings are published. It is undeniable

  that their meaning is a question for the jury; but BLACKBURN, J., in effect, says:

  "Whatever they may find their meaning to be, I shall still direct a verdict for the

  defendants." Therefore to test the learned judge’s right to so direct them, we

  must take the extreme possible finding of the jury. The jury might find the first libel to

  mean, "is a convicted felon now," and not merely that plaintiff was one at some

  past time. And if they had found so, then the same question would have arisen on this

  libel as on the second; for, on that certainly they might have found very easily that a

  "felon editor" implied plaintiff was a felon then, at the time the libel was

  published. Then supposing the jury to have found so, on both libels, how does it stand?

  The plaintiff does not and could not dispute the conviction. I assume the facts most

  strongly against the plaintiff; I assume he was rightly convicted, in all probability it

  was so. But still I am of opinion that, even on these facts, the plea would show no

  justification, if the punishment had been proved to have been served. After that, the man

  was no longer a "felon", and he would have an action against whomsoever called

  him one. For that proposition there is distinct authority.</p>
<p align="justify">….I agree most fully with CLEASY, B., that public policy is all

  against people who make such unjustifiable statements as these; but, in doing so, I wish

  to guard myself against being supposed to say there is anything which should prevent

  inquiry into a man’s past conduct and character on a proper and justifiable occasion.

  There are many such, and in those cases, both in motive and reason, the inquiry is

  justifiable. But people who will rake up all that is against a man in his past history,

  for their private purposes, and to gratify personal or professional spite, have nothing

  whatever to be said on their behalf. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">221.    In Carter-Ruck on Libel and Slander 5<sup>th</sup>

Edn at page 98, the learned authors wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Publishers may do well to remember that a plea of justification may

  fail where the words complained of consist in the raking up of a long buried past which

  ‘though literally true’ may suggest that a taint upon the character still

  subsists. It is submitted that an action would lie in these circumstances on the basis

  that what is at stake is a person’s reputation today and not the reputation that he

  might have, or even perhaps ought to have, had the episode not been lived down and

  forgotten. Similarly, publishers must beware of portraying a person as still suffering

  from some disreputable or otherwise defamatory character trait or condition in their past

  (for example drug-taking) when they have in fact reformed or recovered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">222.    In <i>Sutherland v. Stopes</i> [1924] All

E.R.Rep.19, Lord Shaw in the House of Lords said at p 32:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">….a statement of fact or opinion which consists in the raking up

  of a long-buried past may, without an explanation –and, in cases which are

  conceivable, even with an explanation—be libellous or slanderous if written or

  uttered in such circumstances as to suggest that a taint upon character and conduct still

  subsists, and that the plaintiff is accordingly held up to ridicule, reprobation, and

  contempt. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">223.    Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander 9<sup>th</sup> Edn

had commented in a footnote at p 444 that the Faulks Committee had cited the above passage

of Lord Shaw as suggesting that ‘muck-raking publications may well be actionable if

they imply that a taint on the plaintiff’s character still remains’ (Cmnd. 5909,

 140); though there is no case in which this has been held, it seems correct in

principle, and would apply to any past wrongdoing, not merely to the subject matter of a

conviction. </p>
<p align="justify">224.    In reply to Mr Suresh Damadora’s point that

the defendant here had been raking up the long buried past of Arul, Mr Imran submitted

that there is a distinction between merely disclosing the long buried past and

‘muck-raking’, thereby suggesting that where the disclosure was malicious, it

may be indefensible. He seemed to lean towards the position that justification is no

defence only if it amounts to muck-raking, but not otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">225.    However, when Mr Cashin took his turn to submit,

he appeared to take the more extreme position that a plaintiff has no remedy whatsoever in

defamation if what happened in the long buried past is true in fact. A plea of

justification is not defeated by proof of muck-raking. </p>
<p align="justify">226.    This is indeed a difficult public policy point.

Put simply, should public policy step in to deprive a defendant of his defence of

justification if dredging up of the long buried unsavoury past of a plaintiff is proved to

have been actuated by malice. Is this to be an exception so to speak to the general common

law position stated in Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander (9<sup>th</sup> Edn) at p 444 para

17.1, which was cited to me by Mr Cashin:</p>
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">The common law.</p></b> Since the common law gives an <i>absolute

  defence</i> in respect of the publication of matter which is true<i>, even if the

  publication was unworthy and malicious</i>, there is no general remedy in civil

  proceedings for the revelation of past wrongdoing, <i>however much the wrongdoer may have

  reformed, and for however long he has led an honest and socially valuable life.</i>

  (Italics are mine for emphasis.)

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">227.    Mr Cashin submitted that the Civil Rights of

Convicts Act of 1826, was the authority on which the Court of Appeal in <i>Leyman v

Latimer </i>relied on to reinforce the argument that it was against public policy to

allege when pleading justification that the plaintiff had been convicted of an offence

which had taken place many years ago. The Civil Rights of Convicts Act might have

reflected the public policy of England in the 1820s, and likewise, Leyman’s decision

might have reflected the public policy in the 1870s. But that was the public policy of

another country 130 years ago. He submitted that there is no evidence or authority to

suggest that the public policy in Singapore today is against justifying the truth of a

matter occurring 25 years ago. By not adopting the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act of

1974, which is the most recent English equivalent of the Civil Rights of Convicts Act, Mr

Cashin submitted that the Singapore legislature is clearly saying that the public policy

in Singapore does not accept that it is wrong to raise spent convictions when proving

justification in libel. By analogy, the same applies to wrong doing in civil matters.

Secondly, since it is not Arul’s stand that what he did 25 years ago was wrong and

his conduct was reprehensible but he is now an entirely new man, Mr Cashin argued that it

comes ill from his mouth now to say that what the defendant did was against public policy.</p>
<p align="justify">228.    I will deal with the second point first. The

public policy issue is to my mind the plaintiff’s reserve argument in the event that

(a) the defendant succeeds in establishing that the defamatory meaning was merely that he

had done wrong in the past, without any further insinuation that a stain remains on his

character, and (b) the defendant further succeeds in proving that the plaintiff had in

fact abetted the others in deceiving Tara of her land and hence, he was indeed at that

time a most vicious and dangerous fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">229.    I think the plaintiff is entitled to raise the

public policy point to defeat the defendant’s justification plea if there is indeed

such a public policy against malicious muck-raking of the long buried past that will

defeat that plea. The fact that he never admitted to any wrongdoing, and thus has never

repented, is quite irrelevant. </p>
<p align="justify">230.    In England, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act

1974 contains special provisions, applying to defamation actions founded upon the

publication of a spent conviction in relation to a person considered under the Act as

having been rehabilitated. Of interest is s 8(5) of the Act which provides that the

defendant shall not be entitled to rely on the defence of justification if the publication

of a spent conviction record is proved to have been made with malice. We do not have a

similar Act dealing with defamation arising from publication of spent convictions. But

this does not mean that without the aid of an Act of Parliament, public policy against

malicious muck-raking cannot gradually develop, evolve and later be established as part of

the common law in Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">231.    In my judgment, malicious muck-raking using

events of the buried past, done with the <u><b>sole</b></u> intention to injure should be

prohibited by public policy even though the scandalous past is established to be true in

fact. The defendant should be denied the availability of his justification defence if he

is shown to have acted purely out of malice. </p>
<p align="justify">232.    If a person has been convicted several years ago

of an offence or has been involved in some misconduct or wrongdoing (whether it be civil,

criminal or moral in nature) in the past, I find it hard to see any real benefit to the

public in allowing a resurrection of the scandal if that person is quietly leading a

private life. But there can be many special circumstances justifying the disclosure or

reminder of past misdeeds. For instance, the long hidden past scandal of child molestation

should rightly be disclosed if the person concerned is a school teacher, even if that

disclosure is done by an enemy with a predominant malicious motive to injure that school

teacher. Another example will be where a person’s fitness to stand for public office

is in issue. Again, disclosure of the long buried past may be justifiable and be protected

by the justification defence <b>even if done maliciously</b>. </p>
<p align="justify">233.    Hence, if there is some duty or legitimate

interest to resurrect matters that rightfully belong to the long buried past, the

defendant remains protected by the justification defence even if he has acted with

predominantly malicious motives. The distinction here is that where malice will defeat the

defences of fair comment and qualified privilege, it will not defeat the justification

defence if it is made out, provided that the defendant can show that he still harbours

some belief, however slight, that he has some duty or legitimate interest to disclose the

long buried past, although his predominant motive is malicious in nature to injure the

plaintiff’s character and reputation nonetheless. It is only when his intention to

injure is his sole and exclusive motive that public policy will step in to deny him his

justification defence. For I see no good reason to allow a man to be continuously

crucified and reminded of his long past misdeeds, whatever they may be, if it serves no

other purpose than to remind him and others of what he had done in the buried past.

Whether he has repented or not is to my mind quite irrelevant. Why should the law allow a

continuous crucifixion of a man for the rest of his life simply because he has never

repented for a long past misdeed of his? </p>
<p align="justify">234.    On the facts of this case, I find that the

defendant’s dominant motive was to injure the plaintiff and to seek revenge against

him in those publications. Nevertheless, the evidence does show at least for the 2<sup>nd</sup>

and 3<sup>rd</sup> publications that he also had a collateral but <b>subsidiary</b> motive

to let the GC members know of Arul’s long buried past conduct because he did feel

that they ought to know of it and take action to remove him from holding office in the

Club. His main motive was that he wanted the plaintiff sacked from his office appointments

in the Club and even from the Club membership, out of spite and personal revenge for

witch-hunting him in the first place. </p>
<p align="justify">235.    I do not think that public policy should deny

the defendant his defence of justification for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

publications, provided he can justify all the stings in his libels. But my finding is that

he has failed in his plea of justification. However, if I am wrong in that, then it is my

conclusion that on the facts, public policy will not deny him his defence of justification

for these two publications for the reasons I have stated. </p>
<p align="justify">236.    However, the 1<sup>st</sup> publication stands

on a different footing. It appears to me that his intention was pure muck-raking of the

long buried past. As such, even if he makes out the plea of justification, public policy

will deny him that defence of justification.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Qualified Privilege</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">237.    Being a member of the Club, its affairs will

naturally be of some legitimate and personal concern to the defendant. The GC manages the

Club’s affairs including the Club’s finances and the conduct of its members. The

M &amp; R is responsible for the proper conduct of its members and for determining whether

applicants should be permitted to join the Club. The plaintiff was elected to the GC in

1997. In 1998, he became its vice-president. Understandably, he would have an influential

role to play in the GC and in the management of the Club. With his appointment in 1998 as

the chairman of the M &amp; R, he had a prominent role to play in ensuring that the Club

members behaved in a proper manner. As such, he would be called upon to take appropriate

action against those who did not do so. He would have a large say in determining the

suitability of persons joining the Club.</p>
<p align="justify">238.    I have little difficulty accepting the

defendant’s contention that the plaintiff’s suitability to serve in those

positions was a matter of proper and legitimate interest to him, and to the president and

GC members, who were the recipients of his defamatory publications.</p>
<p align="justify">239.    In my mind, the occasion for the publication

will be covered by qualified privilege, provided that the publication is limited to those

matters of legitimate common interest or concern to them. </p>
<p align="justify">240.    It is common ground that if malice existed at

the time of the defendant’s publication and that malice had actuated his publication,

it will defeat his defences of qualified privilege and fair comment. The burden however is

on the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probability that the sole or dominant motive for

the publication was not to raise matters of genuine legitimate common interest or concern,

but to injure him. </p>
<p align="justify">241.    I am rightly reminded by counsel for the

defendant that the mere use of strong words by the defendant does not amount to malice <i>per

se</i>. Further, once the occasion of qualified privilege is established, the court must

be slow to draw the inference that the defendant is actuated by improper motives in making

the publication to the GC, particularly when he honestly believes in the truth of his

publications. The fact that the matters of genuine legitimate interest to both the

publisher and publishee, will of themselves speak ill of the plaintiff in some way, does

not defeat the qualified privilege, which is a defence provided as a result of the need to

allow those protecting their legitimate interests to express or discuss them honestly free

from any fear of the defamation laws, although what the publisher honestly believes in and

said in relation to those legitimate interests may in fact be wrong, untrue or

unjustifiable. </p>
<p align="justify">242.    A qualified privilege exists at common law where

the defendant makes a statement in pursuance of a legal, social or moral duty, or in the

protection or furtherance of a legitimate interest, to a person with a corresponding duty

or interest to receive it, thereby giving rise to this reciprocity of duty or interest

(frequently common but not necessarily identical in nature), which is essential in

establishing a qualified privilege defence. See <i>Adam v Ward</i> 1917 AC 309 at 334. But

the publisher must not abuse such a privileged occasion and use it as a disguise (a) to

further his real predominant motive of injuring another by his slanderous or libellous

statement, or (b) for some other dominant improper motive or purpose e.g. personal spite,

ill-will or vengeance. Neither can he knowingly bring in matters entirely extraneous and

irrelevant to the protection of the legitimate interest or the discharge of the legal,

social or moral duty, which creates the privilege. Not only will that constitute evidence

of malice, but it seems to me that totally extraneous and irrelevant matters will

necessarily be outside the protection afforded by the privilege in the first place, even

though the publisher may have subjectively believed them to be relevant. </p>
<p align="justify">243.    In determining whether the occasions of

publication are privileged and whether the publications have been made maliciously, I will

respectfully follow the general approach stated by Lord Diplock in the well known case of <i>Horrocks

v Lowe</i> [1975] AC 135 at 150, but subject to what I state at paragraphs 244 to 250

below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">So, the motive with which the defendant on a privileged occasion made a

  statement defamatory of the plaintiff becomes crucial. The protection might, however, be

  illusory if the onus lay on him to prove that he was actuated solely by a sense of the

  relevant duty or a desire to protect the relevant interest. So he is entitled to be

  protected by the privilege unless some other dominant and improper motive on his part is

  proved. ‘Express malice’ is the term of art descriptive of such a motive.

  Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular sense of a desire to injure the person

  who is defamed and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But

  to destroy the privilege the desire to injure must be the dominant motive for the

  defamatory publication; knowledge that it will have that effect is not enough if the

  defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide

  protection of his own legitimate interests.</p>
<p align="justify">The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be

  inferred from what he did or said or knew. If it be proved that he did not believe that

  what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice, for no

  sense of duty or desire to protect his own legitimate interests can justify a man in

  telling deliberate and injurious falsehoods about another, save in the exceptional case

  where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without endorsing, defamatory reports made

  by some other person.</p>
<p align="justify">Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the

  defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth

  of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, "honest

  belief". If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or

  caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated

  as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to

  be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive

  belief that it is true. The freedom of speech protected by the law of qualified privilege

  may be availed of by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording to them immunity from

  suit if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral duty or in

  protection of a legitimate interest, the law must take them as it finds them. In ordinary

  life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction

  from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious

  assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their

  temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on

  intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to

  recognise the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the

  conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the

  belief is arrived at it may still be "honest", that is, a positive belief that

  the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more. </p>
<p align="justify"><u><b>Even a positive belief in the truth</b> of what is published on a

  privileged occasion—which is presumed unless the contrary is proved—may not be

  sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the

  occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law.

  The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a

  desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest, <b>but to give

  vent to his personal spite or ill-will towards the person he defames</b>. <b>If this be

  proved, then even positive belief in the truth of what is published will not enable the

  defamer to avail himself of the protection of the privilege to which he would otherwise

  have been entitled. </b>There may be instances of improper motives which destroy the

  privilege apart from personal spite. A defendant’s dominant motive may have been to

  obtain some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constitutes

  the reason for the privilege. If so, he loses the benefit of the privilege despite his

  positive belief that what he said or wrote was true.</u></p>
<p align="justify">Judges and juries should, however, be very slow to draw the

  inference that a defendant was so far actuated by improper motives as to deprive him of

  the protection of the privilege unless they are satisfied that he did not believe that

  what he said or wrote was true or that he was indifferent to its truth or falsity. The

  motives with which human beings act are mixed. They find it difficult to hate the sin but

  love the sinner. Qualified privilege would be illusory, and the public interest that it is

  meant to serve defeated, if the protection which it affords were lost merely because a

  person, although acting in compliance with a duty or in protection of a legitimate

  interest, disliked the person whom he defamed or was indignant at what he believed to be

  that person’s conduct and welcomed the opportunity of exposing it. <u>It is only

  where his desire to comply with the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest

  plays no significant part in his motives for publishing what he believes to be true that

  "express malice" can properly be found. </u></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="justify">There may be evidence of the defendant’s conduct upon occasions

  other than that protected by the privilege which justify the inference that upon the

  privileged occasion too his dominant motive in publishing what he did was personal spite

  or some other improper motive, even although he believed it to be true.</p></u> But where, as

  in the instant case, conduct extraneous to the privileged occasion itself is not relied

  on, and the only evidence of improper motive is the content of the defamatory matter

  itself or the steps taken by the defendant to verify its accuracy, there is only one

  exception to the rule that in order to succeed the plaintiff must show affirmatively that

  the defendant did not believe it to be true or was indifferent to its truth or falsity.

  Juries should be instructed and judges should remind themselves that this burden of

  affirmative proof is not one that is lightly satisfied.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The exception is where what is published incorporates defamatory matter

  that is not really necessary to the fulfilment of the particular duty or the protection of

  the particular interest upon which the privilege is founded. Logically it might be said

  that such irrelevant matter falls outside the privilege altogether. But if this were so it

  would involve the application by the court of an objective test of relevance to every part

  of the defamatory matter published on the privileged occasion; whereas, as everyone knows,

  ordinary human beings vary in their ability to distinguish that which is logically

  relevant from that which is not and few, apart from lawyers, have had any training which

  qualifies them to do so. So the protection afforded by the privilege would be illusory if

  it were lost in respect of any defamatory matter which upon logical analysis could be

  shown to be irrelevant to the fulfilment of the duty or the protection of the right upon

  which the privilege was founded. As Lord Dunedin pointed out in <i>Adam v. Ward</i> [1917]   A.C. 309, 326-327 <u>the proper rule as respects irrelevant defamatory matter incorporated

  in a statement made on a privileged occasion is to treat it as one of the factors to be

  taken into consideration in deciding whether, in all the circumstances, an inference that

  the defendant was actuated by express malice can properly be drawn. </u>As regards

  irrelevant matter the test is not whether it is logically relevant but whether, in all the

  circumstances, it can be inferred that the defendant either did not believe it to be true

  or, though believing it to be true, realised that it had nothing to do with the particular

  duty or interest on which the privilege was based, but nevertheless seized the opportunity

  to drag in irrelevant defamatory matter to vent his personal spite, or for some other

  improper motive. Here, too, judges and juries should be slow to draw this inference. <b>(Emphasis

  is mine.)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">244.    While I accept that irrelevant defamatory matter

embedded or incorporated in a statement made on a privileged occasion can certainly be

evidence from which malice may be inferred, I will most respectively hesitate to take the

rather extreme position (if indeed the last paragraph in the above passage I quoted from

Lord Diplock was meant to suggest) that totally irrelevant and extraneous defamatory

matter, which though published on the same occasion as those other defamatory matters

qualifying for the privilege, can never at the same time constitute independent defamatory

matter falling completely outside the qualified privilege defence.</p>
<p align="justify">245.    When there are lengthy defamatory passages in a

statement spread over several pages, one might well find irrelevant and extraneous

defamatory matters within it which must objectively be considered as standing alone and

divorced from other parts of the defamatory passages covered by a qualified privilege. To

allow all extraneous and unconnected defamatory matters to come within the qualified

privilege defence merely because they happened to be made in one statement published on a

privileged occasion, is too generous to the defendant. It will be a question of fact and

degree as to which parts are fairly and reasonably connected to the matters occasioning

the privilege and the consequential protection, and which parts will not be so connected

as not to enjoy that protection of qualified privilege, although they are dragged in and

published on the same occasion of privilege. </p>
<p align="justify">246.    In fact that was the position taken by the House

of Lords in <i>Adam v Ward</i> (1917) AC 309 on this issue. Lord Finlay L.C. stated at p

318 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The privilege extends only to a communication upon the subject with

  respect to which privilege exists, and it does not extend to a communication upon any

  other extraneous matter which the defendant may have made at the same time. The

  introduction of such extraneous matter may afford evidence of malice which will take away

  protection on the subject to which privilege attaches, and the communication on the

  extraneous matter is not made upon a privileged occasion at all, in as much as the

  existence of privilege on one matter gives no protection to irrelevant libels introduced

  into the same communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">247.    At p 320, Earl Loreburn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">But the fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily

  protect all that is said or written on that occasion. Anything that is not relevant and

  pertinent to the discharge of the duty or the exercise of the right or the safeguarding of

  the interest which creates the privilege will not be protected. To say that foreign matter

  will not be protected is another way of saying the same thing. The facts of different

  cases vary infinitely, and I do not think the principle can be put more definitely than by

  saying that the judge has to consider the nature of the duty or right or interest and to

  rule whether or not the defendant has published something beyond what was germane and

  reasonably appropriate to the occasion, or has given to it a publicity incommensurate to

  the occasion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">248.    The same view was expressed by Lord Dunedin at p

327:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If the defamatory statement is quite unconnected with and irrelevant to

  the main statement which is ex hypothesi privileged, then I think it is more accurate to

  say that the privilege does not extend thereto that to say, though the result may be the

  same, that the defamatory statement is evidence of malice. But when the defamatory

  statement is, so to speak, part and parcel of the privileged statement and relevant to the

  discussion, then I think the first way is the true way to put it [i.e. whether the

  occasion was a privileged occasion, and if it was, then, secondly, whether there was any

  evidence of malice], and under it will also range all the cases where the express malice

  is arguable from the too great severity or redundancy of expressions used in the

  privileged document itself. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">249.    Further at p 340, Lord Atkinson had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Some question was raised as to whether the presiding judge was the

  person to decide whether any foreign and irrelevant matter had been introduced into the

  libel, and whether it was separable. I think it must be the judge who is to do so. He it

  is who must decide whether the occasion is privileged or not, and if that be so, he must

  necessarily decide in respect of what portion of the libel the occasion would be

  privileged if it stood by itself. A more difficult question, however, remains upon which

  the authorities cited give little, if any, assistance. It is this: What would be the

  effect of embodying separable foreign and irrelevant defamatory matter in a libel? Would

  it make the occasion of the publication of the libel no longer privileged to any extent,

  or would those portions of the libel which would have been within the protection of the

  privileged occasion, if they had stood alone and constituted the entire libel, still

  continue to be protected, the irrelevant matter not being privileged at all and furnishing

  possible evidence that the relevant portion was published with actual malice. In the

  absence of all guiding authority the latter would, in my opinion, be more consistent with

  justice and legal principle, and I think it is in law, the true result. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">250.    LP Thean J (as he then was) in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v

Davies</i> <nobr>[1989] SLR 1063</nobr> at p 1101 also came to the same conclusion, which I

respectfully agree with, that the protection of a privileged occasion therefore does not

extend to statements which have no relevance to a reply to the attack or which are not in

any way appropriate to the occasion. </p>
<p align="justify">251.    On the evidence, it is clear to me that the

defendant honestly believed in the truth of what Abdul Razak J had said of the

plaintiff’s conduct in relation to Mdm Tara, a housewife in Johore, since the learned

judge had heard the testimony of all the witnesses over 28 days of hearing and deliberated

on the evidence. Furthermore, in Civil Appeal No 216 of 1982, the Federal Court,

comprising 3 appellate judges Lee Hun Hoe C.J. (Borneo), Salleh Abas C.J. (Malaya) and

Abdoolcader F.J., after reviewing the evidence, found that the learned trial judge was

justified in all his findings of fact. As the descriptions were given to the plaintiff,

and in the defendant’s words "not by a taxi driver but by a High Court

Judge", the defendant said that he had no good reason at the material time to

disbelieve what he read from the judgments. </p>
<p align="justify">252.    It was submitted that the defendant had no cause

to harbour any ill motive to injure the plaintiff. He had merely acted out of his sense of

duty and interest as a long-standing member of the Club to bring to the attention of the

president and the members of the GC in essence that the vice-president of the GC and

chairman of the M &amp; R Committee is a dangerous fraud. </p>
<p align="justify">253.    In my mind, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

publications clearly attract the protection of qualified privilege. They purport to raise

the issue of Arul’s fitness to hold office in the Club having regard to what was said

of him by Justice Abdul Razak. That is certainly a matter which, objectively speaking,

would and should be a matter of common legitimate concern to both the GC and Club members.

Even if the GC itself is not happy to hear of it, or does not want to entertain it for

ulterior reasons best known to itself, the occasion of privilege can still arise as the

test is objective. </p>
<p align="justify">254.    But in my judgment, the 1<sup>st</sup>

publication does not attract the privilege. A lot of irrelevant defamatory material was

deliberately attached to the letter dated 10 July 1998 to the president and the GC, which

was for a very specific and limited purpose. Patently, the letter to them was not to raise

the issue whether Arul was a fit person to hold office but to ask whether they had

instructed Arul to question him on the authorship of the layman’s guide. The clear

intention and thrust of this inquiry, which I have earlier alluded to, can be seen in the

covering letter and in his affidavit. It was an enquiry for purely personal reasons. Since

his enquiry was not made to the GC, pursuant to the exercise of any duty, or for the

protection or furtherance of any legitimate interest, under circumstances where there is a

corresponding duty or interest on the part of the GC to receive it, the defendant has

failed to establish that his 1<sup>st</sup> publication, containing the attached

irrelevant defamatory letters exchanged between himself and the plaintiff earlier, was

made on an occasion of qualified privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">255.    Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that after

the GC had informed the defendant that the GC was no longer involved in the matter between

the plaintiff and the defendant, there was no longer any interest and duty thereafter on

the part of the GC to receive further correspondence from the defendant with respect to

the plaintiff. Hence, no qualified privilege can exist. I reject this submission. Whether

the interest or duty on the part of the GC exists will depend on the contents of the

subsequent publication. In this case, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> publications

have raised new matters directly to the GC concerning the plaintiff’s suitability to

hold office in the Club. The occasion of privilege can still arise and in my judgment, it

does.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Fair Comment</p></b>
<p align="justify">256.    The defendant relies on Section 9 of the Act

which provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In an action for libel or slander in respect of words consisting partly

  of allegations of fact and partly of expression of opinion, a defence of fair comment

  shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if

  the expression of opinion is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or

  referred to in the words complained of as are proved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">257.    An objective test must be applied to determine

if the comment based on the proved facts can be expressed by a fair-minded person.

Paragraph 12.14 in Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander (9th Edn) at p 257 explains why the

defendant’s allegedly fair comment must first be grounded on basic facts, which must

be substantially true and correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>Facts upon which comment is based must be true</b>. If the facts

  stated in the publication as a basis for comment are themselves defamatory, the defendant

  must plead justification or privilege in relation to them, and fair comment will be no

  defence. But even if they are not defamatory they must subject to section 6 of the

  Defamation Act 1952 be shown to be true: a writer may not suggest or invent facts, or

  adopt as true the untrue statements of fact made by others, and then comment on them on

  the assumption that they are true. If the facts upon which the comment purports to be made

  do not exist, the defence of fair comment must fail. Comment based on matters of opinion

  only, which may or may not be true, equally affords no defence. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">258.    An illustration in relation to court proceedings

is provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">..Again, the defence of fair comment will fail if the defendant omits

  from the statement of facts on which the comment purports to be based some important fact

  which (had it been mentioned) would falsify or alter the complexion of the facts that are

  stated. For example, if A states that B was convicted by a jury of a serious crime and

  comments adversely on the fact, but omits to state that the conviction was quashed by the

  Court of Appeal, his words cannot be defended as fair comment. Comment on facts

  inaccurately reported cannot be fair comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">259.    After crossing the above basic hurdles, we come

to the 3 essential elements to the defence, which must be satisfied. Very briefly, the

offending words must (i) not be fact but comment which is (ii) objectively fair and (iii)

on a matter of legitimate public interest or concern. An inference of fact may well

qualify as comment. But it must be recognisable as such by the ordinary, reasonable and

fair-minded reader having regard to the whole context of the publication. When such a

reader cannot readily distinguish whether the defendant is stating a fact or making a

comment, then the proper approach will be to deny the defendant the benefit of the defence

of fair comment. I will adopt the following passage taken from Gatley on Libel &amp;

Slander (9<sup>th</sup> Edn) at p 255, paragraph 12.11:</p>
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">Comment and fact confused. </p></b>If the defendant has failed to

  distinguish clearly in what he has published between the facts on which he is commenting

  and the comments he wishes to make on those facts, those to whom the words are published

  may regard the comments either as statements of fact or as founded upon unrevealed

  information in the possession of the publisher; in such circumstances the publication may

  stand in the same position as any ordinary allegation of fact. Where the comment is not

  clearly identified there is a tendency to hold the entire statement to be one of fact.

  "In the first place", said Fletcher-Moulton L.J. in <i>Hunt v. Star Newspaper</i>

  [1908] 2 K.B. 309 "comment in order to be justifiable as fair comment must appear as

  comment and must not be so mixed up with the facts that the reader cannot distinguish

  between what is report and what is comment: see <i>Andrews v. Chapman</i> (1853) 3 C.

  &amp; K. 286 at p 288. The justice of this rule is obvious. If the facts are stated

  separately and the comment appears as an inference drawn from those facts, any injustice

  that it might do will be to some extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon

  which the unfavourable inference is based. But if fact and comment be intermingled so that

  it is not reasonably clear what portion purports to be inference, he will naturally

  suppose that the injurious statements are based on adequate grounds known to the writer,

  though not necessarily set out by him. In the one case the insufficiency of the facts to

  support the inference will lead fair-minded men to reject the inference. In the other case

  it merely points to the existence of extrinsic facts which the writer considers to warrant

  the language he uses…Any matter, therefore, which does not indicate with a reasonable

  clearness that it purports to be comment, and not statement of fact, cannot be protected

  by the plea of fair comment. 

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">260.    It is in the nature of the defence of fair

comment that the words must first be shown by the defendant to qualify as his comment,

opinion or viewpoint, and not a statement or imputation of fact made by him. This defence

cannot extend to any defamatory allegations of fact. With that in perspective, I would

respectfully quote and apply what the Court of Appeal in Aaron’s case had said is the

law on fair comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In order to succeed on the plea of fair comment, the subject matter of

  the comments must be on a matter of legitimate public interest. What is legitimate public

  interest has been given a wide scope. Lord Denning MR said in <i>London Artists Ltd v

  Littler</i> [1969] 2QB 375, at p 391:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Whenever a matter is such as to affect people at large, so that they

    may be legitimately interested in, or concerned at, what is going on; or what may happen

    to them or to others; then it is a matter of public interest on which everyone is entitled

    to make fair comment. </p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The next question is whether an honest and fair-minded person on the

  basis of the facts which the respondents have proved can honestly hold and express such

  opinions. We refer to the very concise and oft-quoted passage of Diplock J’s

  direction to the jury in <i>Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd</i> [1958] 1 WLR 743, at p

  749:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…I will remind you of the test once more. Could a fair-minded man,

    holding a strong view, holding perhaps an obstinate view, holding perhaps a prejudiced

    view--- could a fair-minded man have been capable of writing this? That is a totally

    different question from the question: Do you agree with what he said?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The essential thing is the honest opinion of a fair-minded person and

  in this connection every allowance or latitude must be given for any prejudice and

  exaggeration entertained by such a fair-minded person. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">261.    Thus, it must also be determined which of the

proved substratum of facts have given rise to which of the particular comments. It will be

all too easy for the defendant if he is allowed to narrowly cite just one of the many

comments he did make, successfully justify it as fair comment on the basis of certain

limited facts that he manages to prove as true, and then to conclude that he has therefore

made out his plea of fair comment to the entire defamatory publication. To fully succeed

in his defence, he must substantially justify as being fair, all the comments which can

reasonably be found in the offending words complained of.</p>
<p align="justify">262.    Defendant’s counsel submitted that the

defendant made the following fair comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The Plaintiff’s conduct/behaviour pertaining to the Johore

  housewife’s case revealed him to be a vicious and dangerous fraud;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) For this reason, the Plaintiff would not properly and fairly

  administer Club justice as the Chairman and Convenor of the Rules and Membership

  Sub-Committee;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) The Plaintiff is not the right man to administer Club justice;

  and/or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(d) The Plaintiff is not suitable to sit as the Chairman and Convenor

  of the Rules and Membership Committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">263.    I find that there are insufficient facts

disclosed in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> publications with respect to the

plaintiff’s conduct and behaviour in Johore, which apparently form the basis of the

defendant’s alleged ‘comment’ that the plaintiff must be regarded as a

‘vicious and dangerous fraud’. In the absence of disclosure of those facts, and

without the defendant making clear that what he is saying is comment, I am treating that

defamatory assertion more as an assertion of fact than a comment. Hence, the defence of

fair comment is unavailable.</p>
<p align="justify">264.    As for the 3<sup>rd</sup> publication, while it

can be said that the plaintiff’s conduct and actions in Johore were set out in the

attached judgment of Abdul Razak J., the defendant nevertheless had not sufficiently

disclosed or highlighted to the ordinary reader of ordinary diligence that two appeals of

the plaintiff were allowed. As explained earlier, the inconspicuous editorial note does

not constitute sufficient disclosure of the plaintiff’s successful appeal against the

conviction and sentence for contempt. By omitting significant facts, the offending words

in the 3<sup>rd</sup> publication (including those in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

publications) cannot be defended as comment which is fair, because the omission does alter

the fair-minded reader’s impression of the character of the plaintiff. The whole

complexion of the facts stated is changed. Therefore, important facts that impact on the

comment must not be suppressed. Otherwise, the honest and fair-minded reader has no proper

means to judge for himself if the plaintiff can still be viewed as a fraud after Tara

withdrew all her allegations against Arul on the advice of her Queen’s Counsel, and

the Privy Council therefore allowed Arul’s appeal by consent. </p>
<p align="justify">265.    Since it is also my finding that the defendant

failed to prove that the plaintiff is a vicious and dangerous fraud to the high degree of

probability required for such a serious allegation, the factual foundation upon which the

entire defence of fair comment rests no longer exists. The defendant cannot fairly comment

on his unsuitability to hold office in the Club and his likely partiality, merely on an

unproved assumption that he is a vicious and dangerous fraud. The defence of fair comment

is thus not available to the defendant in any event.</p>
<p align="justify">266.    Even if I am wrong in that the defence of fair

comment is available to the defendant, my finding that there is malice will again have

negated such a defence. Hence, I will not decide the question whether matters involving

the suitability of a person to hold private office in an exclusive and private club of

some 5000 members is a matter of sufficient legitimate <b>public</b> interest or concern,

and which is therefore open to fair comment. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Qualified Privilege: Fair and accurate report of a judgment</p></b>
<p align="justify">267.    At common law, a fair and accurate report of

judicial proceedings is protected by qualified privilege and, if published

contemporaneously, by absolute privilege. In special circumstances, where the public

interest requires it, reports of proceedings in <b>foreign</b> courts will be protected by

qualified privilege. See Bullen &amp; Leake, Precedents of Pleadings (13<sup>th</sup> Ed)

at page 1274.</p>
<p align="justify">268.    Some guidance as to what constitutes a fair and

accurate report can be found in paragraphs 128 and 129 of Halsbury’s Laws of England

Volume 28 follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<b><p>128. What constitutes a fair and accurate report.</p></b> The report must be fair and

  impartial, although it need not be verbatim, and should convey to its readers the

  substance of what has taken place in court as if they had been present, since this is the

  reason for the privilege. … The report of a portion only of the legal proceedings may

  in many cases detract from its fairness and accuracy. Thus, it may be misleading to report

  the opening speech of counsel without the evidence on which it is founded, or the evidence

  of a witness without the cross-examination. However, it is not necessary as a matter of

  law that the report should be a report of the whole of the proceedings. The publication of

  a report of a separate part of the proceedings will be privileged if it is fair and

  accurate and published without malice. 

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b><p>129. Comments and headings. </p></b>A report is accurate if it truly states the result

  of a legal proceeding, even though it does not state the grounds. However a report must

  not be expanded or interspersed with comments. The heading to a report of proceedings in

  court or in Parliament forms no part of the proceedings and will not be within the

  privilege of the occasion unless it gives a fair summary of the matter contained in the

  report. 

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">269.    Fry L. J in <i>MacDougall v Knight</i> (1890) 25

QBD 1 (Court of Appeal) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…that a fair and accurate report of the judgment in an action,

  published bona fide and without malice, is privileged, although not accompanied by any

  report of the evidence given at the trial….Bowen, L.J., put the point clearly and

  precisely, and I will read what he said as embodying my own view: "I am satisfied

  myself that the judgment of a judge of the land is in itself an act of such a public and

  distinct character as to make it to the interest of the commonwealth that they should know

  it in toto, and provided it is either given verbatim correctly, or correctly summarised,

  it seems to me that the public policy requires that to be the law, and I have no

  hesitation in saying that I believe that to be the law at the present day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">270.    In the same case, Lord Esher M. R. elucidated

the law as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I take the law to be deduced from the holding of the Court in <i>Lewis

  v. Levy</i> 27 L. J. (Q.B.) 282, with regard to the publication of legal proceedings in a

  Court of law, to be that the publication without malice of an accurate report of what has

  been said or done in a judicial proceeding in a court of justice is a privileged

  publication, although what was said or done would, but for the privilege, be libellous

  against an individual and actionable at his suit, and that this is true although what is

  published purports to be, and is, a report not of the whole judicial proceeding, but only

  of a separate part of it, if the report of that part is an accurate report thereof and

  published without malice. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">271.    Defendant’s counsel referred me to The Law

of Defamation in Singapore &amp; Malaysia (2<sup>nd</sup> Edn) by Keith Evans at p 71 and

72:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is in the public interest that reports of certain proceedings be

  made freely, without fear of legal action. Publication of such reports is privileged on

  the ground that the advantage of publicity to the community at large outweighs any private

  injury which might result. However, public advantage arises only if the report is fair and

  accurate - garbled or partial reports of, or detached parts of, proceedings published with

  intent to injure individuals, are not entitled to protection. …Such reports must be

  restricted to details canvassed in the place of record - if the reporter goes beyond,

  garnishing and embellishing the story by adding circumstantial detail, adding his own

  spice, the privilege will be lost and he would have to justify or otherwise defend

  defamatory implications arising from the embellishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">272.    Defendant’s counsel submitted that although

the defendant had only quoted aspects of Justice Abdul Razak’s findings against the

plaintiff, it is nevertheless still a fair and accurate report of the proceedings since

the whole of the judgment regarding the plaintiff condemns him. The defendant had not

embellished anything of what the learned judge had said of the plaintiff. After reading

the judgment of Abdul Razak J., I come to the same conclusion. There is nothing in the

judgment that speaks well of the plaintiff. The derogatory descriptions of the plaintiff

very much captures the learned judge’s opinions and findings on the plaintiff’s

character and conduct. </p>
<p align="justify">273.    Whether the reporting of a judgment, which has

not been overturned on appeal, is fair has to be looked at rather broadly. The question is

whether it has captured some essence of that part of the judgment reported on. I will not

even say that the standard is as high as that of capturing a substantial essence of that

part of the judgment reported on. Understandably, no reporting can ever capture everything

except when the whole judgment is reproduced in full. Any summary has to be an abstraction

of some kind. It is inappropriate to perform micro-surgery to determine whether important

items have been left out, and whether each important item has been properly summarized by

the publisher. I can see practical difficulties for reporters generally if the standard of

fair and accurate reporting is set so high. </p>
<p align="justify">274.    But the question before me here in this case is

not whether it is a fair and accurate report <i>per se</i> of the decision of Justice

Abdul Razak. The question is whether it will still be a fair and accurate report for the

purpose of a defence of qualified privilege when a lower court decision has subsequently

been reversed by an appellate court, be it by a consent order, after a hearing on the

substantial merits, or on purely technical grounds? The failure to highlight the fact that

the decision has been overturned is not only relevant to the question of malice, it also

impinges on the question whether it remains a fair and accurate report of the case as

decided by the trial judge. The Federal Court of Criminal Appeal had in fact allowed

Suppiah, Singh and Arul’s appeal and set aside the order of contempt and the sentence

of 2 years imprisonment imposed by Abdul Razak J ‘for the extremely grievous crime

which they have committed against the court’ i.e. for ‘deceiving, or attempting

to deceive the court.’ Further, the Privy Council had allowed the whole of the civil

appeal by Arul by consent. Under the circumstances, I do not regard the defendant’s

publications objectively as a fair and accurate report of the judgment of Abdul Razak J

where the outcomes of the two appeals against his decision have not been disclosed or

adequately disclosed. </p>
<p align="justify">275.    If I am wrong in finding that it is not a fair

and accurate report, then I think that reporting the fraudulent misconduct abroad of a

Singapore advocate and solicitor is not reporting a matter of idle curiosity or a matter

for gossip, but it is reporting a matter of sufficient legitimate and proper interest that

will confer the qualified privilege of non-contemporaneous reporting of a judgment of a

court. In this case, I do not think that the fact that the judgment is that of a foreign

court makes any difference.</p>
<p align="justify">276.    However, this qualified privilege defence

remains unavailable to the defendant in any event because the plaintiff has succeeded in

establishing that the publications were in fact actuated by malice.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">(1) Whether the consent order of the Privy Council upon certain agreed

terms has the effect of undoing the evidential findings of a considered judgment on the

merits after a full trial.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Whether the plaintiff is estopped from alleging that the words

complained of are false by virtue of the judgments.</p>
<p align="justify">277.    I will deal with the above two issues raised by

the defendant together. Defendant’s counsel made the following submissions: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The words complained of are findings of facts in issue made by the

  trial judge, whose decision was upheld by the Federal Court after a hearing of the appeal

  on the merits. Arul appealed to the Privy Council;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The consent order at the Privy Council allowing the appeal by Arul

  was merely to record a settlement agreement reached Arul and Tara;</p>
<p>(c) The Privy Council had not heard or made any determination on the merits of

  Arul’s appeal;</p>
<p>(d) The consent order was merely an administrative process entered to reflect the

  agreement reached;</p>
<p>(e) Not being a final judicial finding, the consent order had no binding effect except

  against those who were parties to that agreement and the consent order arising therefrom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">278.    Consequently, it was argued that the consent

order does not as a matter of law, render nugatory or overturn the final judicial findings

or determinations made by Abdul Razak J with regard to Arul’s behaviour and conduct

in the Tara case and his character generally. Arul is further estopped from alleging that

the words complained of are false. He cannot now challenge or relitigate in the

proceedings before me the findings of the learned trial judge, which were affirmed by the

Federal Court after a full hearing on the merits, because Arul had a full and fair

opportunity of defending himself both at the trial and at the appeal before the Federal

Court. Since he is estopped from alleging that the words complained of are false, he has

no cause of action in defamation against the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">279.    Counsel relied on <i>Jenkins v Robertson</i>

(1867) L.R. 117 where the Lord Chancellor Chelmsfor said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><i>Res judicata</i>, by its very words, means a matter upon which the

  Court has exercised its judicial mind, and has come to the conclusion that one side is

  right, and has pronounced a decision accordingly. But when an action of declarator is

  brought, and a verdict is obtained by the Pursuers, which is set aside, and an arrangement

  afterwards takes place by which, in consideration of the payment of a sum of money, an

  interlocutor is pronounced for the Defenders, and the Court simply registers that

  interlocutor, without expressing any judicial opinion on the subject, I am of opinion that

  it is contrary to all principle to consider that such a transaction can be treated as <i>res

  judicata</i>. It is admitted that it cannot be <i>res judicata</i> if it is done by

  collusion or by fraud. It is argued that in this case, no fraud is alleged or proved; but

  it is very difficult in any case of this description to prove fraud; and if this were held

  to be a judgment binding strangers, by reason of its being <i>res judicata</i>, it would

  follow that in every case, where any person had brought an action of declarator, which had

  been compromised, the public would be bound unless some stranger could prove that the

  judgment had been obtained by fraudulent collusion between the parties. I am of opinion

  that this is not the meaning of <i>res judicata</i> according to the law of any civilized

  country. I am also of opinion that it was not competent for the Court in the present

  proceeding to go into the question whether this was a reasonable compromise or not. It was

  impossible that the Court could ascertain that. In my opinion, <i>res judicata </i>signifies

  that the Court has, after argument and consideration, come to a decision on a contested

  matter; here the Court exercised no judicial function upon the subject. It has merely

  exercised an administrative function by recording the interlocutor which had been agreed

  to between the parties. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">280.    The case of <i>Saskatoon Credit Union, Ltd. v.

Central Park Enterprises Ltd. et al.</i> 47 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 431 decided by the

British Columbia Supreme Court in Canada was cited to me. Briefly, Spencer J after a trial

on the merits defended by Creighton Holdings Ltd (‘Holdings’) and Central Park

Enterprises (‘Enterprises’), to whom Holdings leased a golf course and

transferred a mobile home and residence, had found these transactions to be fraudulent and

hence, void as against Jeanne Gaspari, the then plaintiff. The two defendants appealed and

an order of the Court of Appeal was entered into by consent in the following terms:

‘This Court doth order that the Appeal herein be and the same is hereby allowed

without costs to either party.’ The Court of Appeal file contained the notice of

appeal, the consent order and a letter from the solicitor for the two defendants,

enclosing the consent order and stating, <i>inter alia</i>, some of the terms of the

settlement. To assist the parties to implement the settlement, the court entered the

consent order without counsel’s appearance and without any consideration of the

merits. The plaintiff, Saskatoon Credit Union, brought the action to recover advances made

to Holdings, and to have the said lease and transfers set aside as fraudulent. Holdings

and Enterprises denied that the transactions were fraudulent. In deciding whether the

defendants were to be prevented from relitigating the question already decided by Spencer

J., the court considered the following two issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) Does a consent judgment of the Court of Appeal purporting to allow

  an appeal against the judgment of Spencer J. made without any hearing on the merits or

  otherwise preclude the application of the <i>res judicata</i> principle?; and</p>
<p align="justify">(2) If not, can <i>res judicata</i> apply when there are different

  plaintiffs but common defendants in the two proceedings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">281.    McEachern C.J. S.C. said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">..I have the view that the Court of Appeal only discharged an

  administrative function by disposing of a pending appeal in order to give effect to a

  settlement which had been disclosed to the court. …</p>
<p align="justify">It is my view, even if estoppel was considered, that Mr Creighton could

  not expect to preclude its operation by a consent judgment of the Court of Appeal without

  some consideration of the merits. With the greatest possible deference to the Court of

  Appeal, I conclude that the order it made in the circumstances of this case by consent,

  and in the administrative sense I have described, does not "undecide" the issues

  solemnly decided by Spencer J. …</p>
<p align="justify">The principle which should govern was stated by Lord Denning M.R. in <i>Tebbutt

  v. Haynes,</i> [1981] 2 All E. R. 238 at p. 242, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I ventured to suggest this principle: if there has been an issue raised

    and decided <i>against </i>a party in circumstances in which he has had a full and fair

    opportunity of dealing with the whole case, then that issue must be taken as being finally

    and conclusively decided <i>against</i> him. He is not at liberty to reopen it unless

    circumstances are such as to make it fair and just that it should be reopened. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">More recently, however, a number of English authorities, particularly

  Lord Denning, have suggested that the principle of abuse of process prevents a party from

  relitigating a question which has been fairly decided against him. This received grudging

  approval in the House of Lords in <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable of West Midlands</i>,

  [1982] A.C. 529 at p. 540.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">282.    After reviewing some cases decided in the United

States and in Canada, where the traditional approach to estoppel per <i>rem judicatam</i>

which operated only between the same parties or their privies is being departed from

gradually, the learned judge held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Without deciding anything about the question of mutuality, it is my

  conclusion that, subject to the exceptions I shall mention in a moment, no one can

  relitigate a cause of action or an issue that has been previously been decided against him

  in the same court or in any equivalent court having jurisdiction in the matter where he

  has or could have participated in the previous proceedings unless some overriding question

  of fairness requires a rehearing.</p>
<p align="justify">The exceptions to the foregoing include fraud or other misconduct in

  the earlier proceedings or the discovery of decisive fresh evidence which could not have

  been adduced at the earlier proceeding by the exercise of reasonable diligence…</p>
<p align="justify">I decline to decide whether the foregoing conclusion represents the

  application of a species of estoppel by <i>res judicata</i> or abuse of process as the

  result is the same. The fact that the plaintiff in this action was not a party to the

  earlier proceedings is of no consequence. With the defendants participating fully, it was

  judicially determined at trial by Spencer J. that the lease and transfers between the

  defendants were fraudulent and that is the end of that issue. The defendants are stopped

  from saying otherwise. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">283.    Counsel for the plaintiffs did not take a firm

position that <i>Saskatoon </i>should not be followed. Instead, he argued that <i>Saskatoon</i>

could be distinguished on the facts. But I could not see sufficiently strong

distinguishing factors. Should I then depart from the traditional approach and adopt the

wider approach taken instead by Spencer J.?</p>
<p align="justify">284.    It is not disputed that parties to proceedings

will be bound by a final judgment pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction after

hearing the merits in those proceedings. Subject to certain exceptions like fraud or

collusion, that judgment so obtained will be conclusive as between the parties (and their

privies) not only as to the results and conclusions, but as well as the grounds and the

findings made on the various issues of fact in the action. As between themselves, they

will be estopped from relitigating or raising those same issues again in another court.

The same applies in the case of a consent judgment, where the parties will similarly be

bound by its terms. As such, a consent order allowing the appeal at the Privy Council does

‘undo’ the findings of the trial judge inter se the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">285.    Where it is a matter involving an external party

to the consent order, the position is less clear. I will prefer to approach it from this

perspective: whether in such a case, the party whose appeal has been allowed by consent,

nevertheless remains estopped from relitigating those issues decided against that party at

the trial below, and as such, an appeal allowed by consent does not ‘undecide’

the issues ‘solemnly decided’ against that party by the trial judge. </p>
<p align="justify">286.    I will examine this question by taking it first

from the defendant’s position. The defendant is clearly not a party to the settlement

which gave rise to the consent judgment at the Privy Council allowing Arul’s appeal.

That settlement was exclusively between Arul and Tara. As such, there is no good reason

why the defendant, a total stranger, should be precluded from proving or justifying afresh

that Arul had indeed committed fraud and breach of trust against Tara, despite the consent

judgment where Tara agreed to withdraw all allegations of fraud against Arul, including

any claim against him as a constructive trustee.</p>
<p align="justify">287.    On the other hand, should Arul himself be

estopped vis a vis a stranger from subsequently challenging before me the findings of fact

made against him by Abdul Razak J., bearing in mind that the consent judgment allowing the

appeal cannot be binding on the stranger, who is never a party to any of the court

proceedings on the Tara matter? Defendant’s counsel argues that the learned trial

judge had condemned Arul in no uncertain terms and the Federal Court, who heard the appeal

on the merits, had upheld the trial judge’s findings and dismissed Arul’s

appeal. Further, Arul had the full opportunity of defending himself both at the trial and

at the Federal Court appeal but he failed in both. The present defendant simply relies on

the totality of these judicial determinations on the merits, and the fact that the Privy

Council consent judgment had not ‘undone’ these judicially determined findings

to found an estoppel against Arul, thereby preventing him from alleging or bringing any

evidence to prove that those findings of facts were wrong or to contradict them in any

way. Put simply, the doctrine of issue estoppel applies according to defendant’s

counsel, and Arul cannot now argue that the judicial findings of Abdul Razak J are wrong. </p>
<p align="justify">288.    However, I will refer to Cross and Tapper on

Evidence (1995 Edn) at page 85, which I find to be very instructive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Issue estoppel is a branch of the law which has been developed recently

  and gradually. The basic principles were first clearly stated by Diplock LJ in <i>Mills v

  Cooper</i> [1967] 2 QB 459 at 468, and subsequently endorsed by the House of Lords in <i>Hunter

  v Chief Constable of West Midlands</i> [1982] AC 529 at 541. The House of Lords rejected

  an attempt by Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal to eliminate the requirements of

  privity and mutuality on the basis that it is unjust that a party against whom an issue

  has been determined after a full opportunity to contest it, should be permitted to raise

  precisely the same issue again in subsequent proceedings involving another. The House of

  Lords preferred to decide the case upon an issue upon which the Court of Appeal had been

  unanimous; that it amounted to an abuse of the process of the court to launch a collateral

  attack upon a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, by raising an issue for a

  second time. The House noted that this involved recognising a difference between the

  operation of the doctrine in England and in North America. The conditions were

  subsequently and concisely reformulated by Lord Brandon in <i>DSV Silo-und

  Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH v Owners of The Sennar</i> [1985] 1WLR 490 at 499. </p>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="justify">In order to create an estoppel of that kind, [issue estoppel per rem

    judicatam] three requirements have to be satisfied. The first requirement is that the

    judgment in the earlier action relied on as creating an estoppel must be (a) of a court of

    competent jurisdiction, (b) final and conclusive and (c) on the merits. The second

    requirement is that the parties (or privies) in the earlier action relied on as creating

    an estoppel and those in the later action in which that estoppel is raised as a bar must

    be the same. The third requirement is that the issue in the later action in which the

    estoppel is raised as a bar must be the same issue as that decided by the judgment in the

    earlier action. </p></u>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In addition to these requirements it should be noted that in relation

  to issue estoppel an earlier judgment may not raise an estoppel if fresh matter has become

  available showing that the earlier decision was wrong. It seems that for these purposes

  the fresh material showing the previous decision to have been wrong can consist either of

  new factual material conclusively showing it to be wrong, or even of a subsequent change

  in the interpretation of the law giving at the least a very substantial chance that the

  earlier decision would be held to be wrong. (Emphasis is mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">289.    Firstly I observe that there are three fairly

strict requirements to be satisfied before the estoppel can arise. On occasions, these

requirements have been narrowly construed, where for instance the estoppel principle may

be held inapplicable when the same party acts in a different capacity. A fortiori, where

either party to the subsequent proceeding is a stranger, no issue estoppel against either

party should operate because the second requirement stated by Lord Brandon in <i>The

Sennar</i> is not met. Even if all the strict requirements are satisfied and the estoppel

has arisen, it does not appear to me that the estoppel doctrine, even as between parties,

is necessarily applied very rigidly without considering the factual circumstances in each

case, since fresh matters, new factual materials, subsequent substantial changes in the

interpretation of the law showing that the earlier decision to have been wrong, and

differences in the standard of proof even where the issues are identical, may well

preclude an issue estoppel from operating. </p>
<p align="justify">290.    I will therefore respectfully adopt the approach

taken by Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, VC in <i>Arnold &amp; Others v National Westminster

Bank plc</i> [1988] 3 All ER 977, Ch D, where he held that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Res judicata, whether cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel, is

  based on the fundamental principle that it is unjust for a man to be vexed twice with

  litigation on the same subject matter coupled with the public interest in seeing an end to

  litigation. So far as cause of action estoppel is concerned, the rule is absolute: You

  cannot sue twice for the same relief based on the same cause of action even if new facts

  or law have subsequently come to light. But it is clear that the rule as to issue estoppel

  is different as the authorities which I have quoted demonstrate; there are circumstances

  in issue estoppel where the injustice of not allowing the matter to be relitigated

  outweighs the hardship to the successful party in the first action in having to relitigate

  the point.</p>
<p align="justify">The rules applicable to issue estoppel and the proper exceptions to it

  are in the course of development: see <i>Carl-Ziess-Stiftung v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd</i>

  (No 2) [1966] 2 All ER 536 at 554, [1967] 1 AC 853 at 917. The authorities show that the

  exception applying to ‘special circumstances’ is designed to ensure that where

  justice requires the non-application of issue estoppel, it shall not apply: see <i>Yat

  Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</i> [1975] AC 581 at 590; [1975] 2 WLR 690 at

  696-697. In the <i>Carl-Zeiss</i> case [1966] 2 All ER 536 at 573, [1967] 1 AC 853 at 947

  Lord Upjohn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘All estoppels are not odious but must be applied so as to work

    justice and not injustice, and I think that the principle of issue estoppel must be

    applied to the circumstances of the subsequent case with this overriding consideration in

    mind.’ </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">291.    A further obstacle in the way of the defendant

is that the decision of Abdul Razak J is a civil judgment in a foreign court. Although no

issue is taken up whether an estoppel can be raised on a foreign judgment, I note that

Lord Reid, Lord Guest and Lord Wilberforce in <i>Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung</i> had advised

considerable caution before allowing an issue estoppel to arise from a foreign judgment.

Among the reasons stated were the unfamiliarity with the procedures in many foreign

countries, the problem of deciding whether the issues determined abroad were merely

collateral, incidental or obiter, whether the foreign judgment was a final judgment on the

merits and whether a party perhaps had not expended full resources to defend an issue on a

trivial matter abroad or might even have abandoned arguing an issue, with the result that

the issue becomes decided against him.</p>
<p align="justify">292.    I will not go so far to say that an issue

estoppel can never arise out of a foreign judgment, particularly if the necessary

ingredients for an issue estoppel to arise are present and the reasons stated for the

caution do not exist. Although the issue estoppel relied on by the defendant is based on a

Malaysian judgment, and the said reasons for taking a careful approach may not be

applicable in the particular circumstances of this case, nevertheless I am still faced

with the question of the admissibility of the facts found by Justice Abdul Razak as

evidence to prove those same facts in issue before me. </p>
<p align="justify">293.    The evidence of findings in other jurisdictions

in relation to foreign convictions remains subject to the rule in <i>Hollington v Hewthorn

Ltd &amp; Anor </i>[1943] K.B. 587, and is, as such, inadmissible as evidence of the

underlying facts: Cross on Evidence 7<sup>th</sup> Edn p108; <i>Union Carbide Corpn v

Naturin Ltd</i> <nobr>[1987] FSR 538</nobr> at p 551. Plaintiff’s counsel referred me to the 15<sup>th</sup>

Report of the Law Reform Committee (Cmnd.3391) which dealt with the Rule in Hollington v.

Hewthorn and in particular to the passage at p 12 where it states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In defamation, if all that is said that the plaintiff was convicted of

  the offence, proof of the conviction establishes the defence of justification; but if, as

  is likely to be the case, the statement imputes that he was guilty of the offence of which

  he was convicted, the defendant must prove the plaintiff’s guilt de novo in the civil

  action for defamation. The conviction is not admissible evidence of guilt. Conversely, a

  defendant may justify a statement that the plaintiff was guilty of a criminal offence of

  which he was acquitted by proving his guilt de novo in the civil action<i>. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">294.    On the assumption that the standard of proof of

a conviction for fraud and criminal breach of trust in Malaysia is higher than the civil

standard of proof for the same issues of facts in a civil trial in Malaysia, it is all the

more so on principle that those findings of fact of fraud and breach of trust in a civil

action in a Malaysian court similarly ought to be inadmissible as evidence in Singapore of

the underlying facts which are in dispute. As such, Arul should not be estopped from

denying the correctness of the findings of Abdul Razak J., which were made in a foreign

jurisdiction. Neither should he be estopped from adducing any evidence in a civil trial in

Singapore to prove that he is not guilty of those matters held against him by Abdul Razak

J.</p>
<p align="justify">295.    I thus allowed the Arul to rebut any evidence

adduced by the defendant in relation to the defendant’s defence of justification that

he was guilty of fraud and breach of trust against the Johore housewife. Taking all the

various factors together, I am satisfied that the justice of this case demands that no

issue estoppel raised by a stranger, should arise against Arul, who should be entitled to

defend his reputation and what he did in Johore as against the defendant<i><b>. </b></i>There

is no countervailing hardship in having the defendant, a stranger, prove the facts he

alleges that Arul is guilty of fraud and breach of trust. It is after all part of his

justification defence. Arul should be entitled to rebut it. I do not see the applicability

of the broader principle of res judicata that the same party in the interest of justice

should not be harassed twice for the same cause as there has to be an end to litigation.

For a start, the defendant is a stranger and he has not been harassed twice by Arul on the

same matter in a court action. It is Arul, having obtained a consent order allowing his

appeal to the Privy Council against the decision of Abdul Razak J., who is trying to

vindicate his reputation again, but this time against a stranger. It will be against the

interest of justice to prevent Arul from doing so simply on the basis of an issue estoppel

on a foreign decision, which decision is in any event allowed albeit by consent on appeal

and settled in favour of Arul. Arul might well have succeeded in challenging Abdul Razak

J’s decision on the merits at the Privy Council hearing had Tara not agreed to

compromise and let Arul’s appeal be allowed with her consent, whatever might be her

reasons. I had checked with Arul that it was not upon payment of money by Arul to Tara

that she compromised her position.</p>
<p align="justify">296.    This leads to the other position that

Tara’s counsel might himself have arrived at the conclusion that Arul’s appeal

had merits and therefore, they decided to let Arul’s appeal be allowed by consent.

Tara herself was advised by Gavin Lightman Q.C. to withdraw all allegations of fraud of

whatever nature and all allegations that Arul was a constructive trustee. Surely Gavin

Lightman Q.C. would have thoroughly considered the strength of Arul’s appeal before

advising Tara. At this stage, Collin Ross Munro Q.C. acting for the plaintiff had not even

begun his arguments before the Privy Council. There must have been very good reasons why

Gavin Lightman Q.C. had advised Tara not to challenge the plaintiff’s appeal on the

merits after having considered all the cause papers including the written arguments

submitted by Collin Ross Munro Q.C. To some extent, I am speculating. But these plausible

situations show that it is difficult to pin an abuse of process label in this case to

preclude Arul from challenging before me the correctness of the material facts as found

previously by Abdul Razak J.</p>
<p align="justify">297.    For these reasons, it also cannot be said that

Arul is mounting any collateral attack on the previous decision of Abdul Razak J if one

takes the view that the learned judge’s decision is in a sense ‘overturned’

and Arul is simply re-defending his reputation on the basis that he is not in fact guilty

of any fraud or breach of trust against Tara, and he is now putting the defendant to

strict proof that he is in fact guilty. </p>
<i><b>
<p>Abuse of Process Doctrine</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">298.    Thus, even on the wider and more flexible

doctrine of abuse of process, which application may extend beyond the parties to the

previous litigation and is based more on general public policy than on any strict and

narrow res judicata principle, I can see no abuse of the process in this court in the

particular course of action taken by the plaintiff as it is also in the public interest

that the courts give a fair hearing to all non-frivolous claims and defences. The need to

stop relitigation of the same issues decided previously, the importance of finality, the

need to avoid inconsistent court decisions on the same issues and a recognition of the

difficulties of retrying events that had taken place long ago, are not the only public

interest considerations that I have to contend with. As Auld L.J. had said in <i>Bradford

and Bingley B.S. v Seddon</i> [1999] 1 W.L.R. 1482 at p 1490, the court must, when

applying the abuse of process doctrine which does not qualify as res judicata, ‘draw

the balance between the competing claims of one party to put his case before the court and

of the other not to be unjustly hounded given the earlier history of the matter’. The

party alleging an abuse of process bears the onus to establish why the relitigation of the

same issue is an abuse. In my judgment, the defendant has not discharged his burden. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Proof of Malice</p></b>
<p align="justify">299.    Much of the evidence relied on to prove malice

is extracted from the defendant’s own affidavit of evidence-in-chief. They amounted

to admissions. Although some may not have been included earlier as specific particulars in

the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s defence of privilege and fair comment,

I do not think however that the plaintiff is precluded by the rules of pleadings from

relying on them to prove that the defendant’s publications were motivated by actual

or express malice.</p>
<p align="justify">300.    A party that unexpectedly brings evidence

detrimental to itself to the trial, and essentially serves those admissions on a silver

platter on the other party, cannot later prevent their use on the ground that the other

party has not specifically pleaded those admissions which that other party has now found

useful to rely on in support of issues that it has the burden of proving. I do not think

that the often quoted general rule that ‘a party is bound by its pleadings’

applies in such instances. </p>
<p align="justify">301.    It is trite law that malice, once established,

will defeat the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege, even if they are made

out. This is where I find that the plaintiff has succeeded substantially. The evidence of

malice as reviewed earlier in this judgment is fairly overwhelming. Evidence of the

defendant’s conduct and action prior to the publication, at the time of the

publication and after the publication including the entire surrounding circumstances, must

be viewed in totality. </p>
<p align="justify">302.    On the whole, I am satisfied that the plaintiff

has succeeded in establishing on a balance of probability that malice was the predominant

actuating force behind all the three publications complained of. Although I accept that

the defendant is someone who has taken a keen interest in the affairs of the Club, and has

written to the Club on many issues, but I think his personal spite, ill-will and vengeance

towards the plaintiff had got the better of him on this occasion because of the

plaintiff’s repeated queries on the Layman’s Guide, which the defendant

perceived to be a relentless witch-hunt by the plaintiff. He must have been irritated and

angry with the plaintiff for repeatedly asking him whether he was the author. He wanted to

retaliate and that was what he did. The learned judge’s harsh words in the Johore

case were exactly what he needed for the retaliation. From the torrent of letters he wrote

on the same subject, it is clear to me that he wanted to teach Arul a lesson. The letters

were written in a manner deliberately to provoke and taunt Arul<i>. </i></p>
<p align="justify">303.    I am keenly aware of what Lord Atkinson had said

in <i>Adam v Ward</i> [1917] AC 309 at 339:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…a person making a communication on a privileged occasion is not

  restricted to the use of such language merely as is reasonably necessary to protect the

  interest or discharge the duty which is the foundation of his privilege; but that, on the

  contrary, he will be protected, even though his language should be violent or excessively

  strong, if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, he might have honestly and

  on reasonable grounds believed that what he wrote or said was true…..</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">304.    But that does not mean that in considering what

a person’s dominant motive is and whether there is any ill-will, spite and anger, it

is totally irrelevant to consider the kind of language used, the way the issues have been

presented, whether the person has been deliberately provocative, sarcastic, antagonistic

and unduly personal. One can be extremely critical and yet honest and objective in the

criticism. But there is a point beyond which it will smack of ill-will and spite. </p>
<p align="justify">305.    From the totality of the evidence, I conclude

that in all his three publications, the predominant motive was to injure the plaintiff,

which was more the result of his desire to hit out at the plaintiff, rather than anything

else. Raising his concern to the president and GC that the plaintiff ought not to hold any

office in the Club because of what a Malaysian High Court judge had said of the plaintiff,

clearly was not his main motive although he had tried to present that as his only motive,

which I do not accept. I am prepared to accept that his concern for the welfare of the

Club was part of his motive, but it certainly was no more than a subsidiary motive. I find

as a fact that it is not the predominant motive. </p>
<p align="justify">306.    The fact that the defendant believes the trial

judge’s findings on Arul to be correct and true because it was the considered

conclusion of a High Court Judge (and not that of ‘a taxi driver’ in his words)

may well negative any contention that his malice might have been actuated by his

non-belief of the truth of his statements or that he had made the statements recklessly

without caring whether they were true or not. But the malice I have inferred comes from

other evidence and not from any deduction that he had not believed in the truth of what he

had published. A person may still be actuated by malice although he honestly believes what

he is saying. The key question is what is his real and significant motive? Has it played a

significant part in actuating his publications? </p>
<p align="justify">307.    Since the defendant had in good faith believed

that Arul was a vicious and dangerous fraud, no doubt I have to be slow before drawing an

inference of express malice that the defendant had misused the privileged occasion and

that his main desire was to smear the plaintiff’s character and reputation before the

president and the GC.</p>
<p align="justify">308.    But taking advantage of the opportunity of a

privileged occasion to give vent to or gratify his private spite, anger, personal

vengeance against Arul, and to throw ‘stones’ and whatever he had at Arul to

ensure that Arul’s so called ‘glass house’ is totally shattered to pieces,

is clearly express malice under the law. That private spite and desire for vengeance is

the antithesis of the legitimate duty or interest which will have afforded him the

privilege or which constitutes the reason for the privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">309.    The defendant went beyond merely doing his duty

or protecting his own interest as a club member. I find that his intention was to abuse

the occasion to defame the plaintiff. His animosity towards the plaintiff was fueled by

his belief that the plaintiff was going to haul him before the Disciplinary Committee. He

hoped that the plaintiff would desist from doing what he believed that the plaintiff was

planning to do, by launching pre-emptive attacks against his character and reputation. He

also hoped that the GC would restrain the plaintiff as he indicated that what he might

want to expose and blow up would also embarrass the GC, if the plaintiff were allowed to

continue to hound him. There is no question of self-defence here as Arul never attacked

the defendant’s character or reputation. He merely asked if he had published the

Layman’s Guide. Obsessed with the belief that Arul was witch-hunting him, he set out

single-mindedly to destroy the character and reputation of Arul and to get rid of him from

all office in the Club including getting rid of him as a Club member, if he could. Those

were his dominant motives actuating his actions to injure the plaintiff. If that is not

malice, I do not know what is. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Damages and Consequential Orders </p></b>
<p align="justify">310.    Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the

damages should be between $750,000 at the lower end and $1,250,000 at the higher end. He

asked for another 50% to be added to the higher figure because exemplary damages should be

awarded in the particular circumstances of this case. Hence, the total damages prayed for

is $1,875,000. Defendant’s counsel submitted however that nominal damages should be

awarded.</p>
<p align="justify">311.    The defendant published grave libels casting

serious imputations on the plaintiff. I have to take account of the plaintiff’s

standing and how significantly that standing has been lowered by the defamatory

publications. The plaintiff is a practising advocate and solicitor of more than 30 years

and was at the time of the publications the vice-president of the Club and the M &amp; R

chairman. The plaintiff gave evidence that he was hurt and I have no reason to disbelieve

him. Compensatory damages must be given both for his hurt feelings and the reduction in

his standing before his social peers in the GC. The anxiety and uncertainty which the

plaintiff is subjected to in the litigation must also be taken into account: <i>Jeyaretnam

JB v Lee Kuan Yew</i> <nobr>[1982] 1 MLJ 239</nobr>. </p>
<p align="justify">312.    The plaintiff also claimed damages for physical

injury arising from a back disc problem that was both painful and inconvenient. He

attributed that to the 4 weeks he spent sitting on a ‘somewhat less than ergonomic

seat in the witness stand’. However, the plaintiff did not testify on his injury.

Neither did he call a doctor to testify on the actual cause of his problem. The plaintiff

later dropped this head of claim.</p>
<p align="justify">313.    Consideration must be given to the fact that the

defendant had limited the circulation of the offending publications only to the

Club’s president and nine other GC members. This means that the amount of damages

will be correspondingly reduced as the ‘damage’ to his reputation is also

contained so to speak. Balanced against this is the repetition of the defamatory remarks

in 3 separate publications to them which naturally increased the plaintiff’s grief

and distress.</p>
<p align="justify">314.    If the defendant’s publications are to

persons who have previously read the judgment of Abdul Razak J., there is a question

whether the plaintiff’s standing has been affected at all by the republication. This

is separate from the hurt caused to the plaintiff, which I imagine will be greater if the

circulation is wider. As most of the then GC members are not lawyers, it is not likely

that they would know of the judgment although it is reported in the Malayan Law Journal.

Accordingly, I will not grant any reduction on account of the defendant’s

republication.</p>
<p align="justify">315.    Absence of an apology does not aggravate

damages. An apology if tendered is a mitigating factor and goes to reduce the damages

which would otherwise be given. Since there is no apology and the defence is one of

justification, there is again no reason for me to consider any reduction.</p>
<p align="justify">316.    A defence of justification put forward

recklessly or with knowledge that it is unsustainable may be further evidence of malice,

justifying aggravated damages: Gatley on Libel and Slander 9<sup>th</sup> Edn. at para

32.41. A partial justification will reduce the damages to the extent to which the words

complained of have been partly justified.</p>
<p align="justify">317.    In this case, the entire justification failed.

Having regard to the requisite degree of proof required for such serious allegations, I

think the defendant was reckless to put forward a defence of justification, relying on

what appears to be largely circumstantial evidence and mere inferences. The defendant was

hoping to establish the plaintiff’s fraudulent conduct through the plaintiff himself

without calling a single witness to testify on the Johore matter. This is ambitious to say

the least. Although Tara was located by the defendant, yet he did not call her to testify

in support of his justification defence. No evidence was called to substantiate the

numerous factual questions put to the plaintiff during his cross-examination. Questions

were also asked which assumed that a trustee may not be on the land register as a

proprietor under the National Land Code. Yet, the defendant called no expert witness on

Malaysian land law to testify in support of that assumption. Under these circumstances, I

have to award aggravated damages for the defendant’s reckless plea of justification. </p>
<p align="justify">318.    In mitigation of damage, defendant’s

counsel submitted 18 reasons and cited numerous events demonstrating why the plaintiff

must be regarded as a person with a bad reputation generally. Since his bad reputation

cannot be damaged any further by the defendant’s publications, only nominal damages

should be granted. </p>
<p align="justify">319.    I find this submission to be without merit. I

have in the course of my judgment dealt with a number of those reasons and I shall not

repeat them here. I will now deal with those that I have not covered. </p>
<p align="justify">320.    The defendant cited the incident on 12 October

1998, where the plaintiff was alleged to have wrongfully represented the workings of Rule

2 (ii) of the Club rules despite being cognisant of JC Lee Seiu Kin’s judgment: see <i>Graeme

McGuire v John Rasmussen</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 180</nobr>. Even if that were true, the

misrepresentation was made <b>after</b> the date of the last publication complained of.

Consequently, it is not relevant in mitigation of damage to prove that the plaintiff was

viewed at the time of publication as having a poor reputation because the wrongful

representation had not yet been made.</p>
<p align="justify">321.    Similarly, his veracity in giving evidence in

the present proceedings before me cannot be used to prove his general bad reputation, as

it is an event long after the defamatory publications. As for his veracity in giving

evidence in Johore, there is no evidence before me that any of the GC members had regarded

the plaintiff as a man of poor reputation because they knew of his alleged dishonest

conduct before the courts in Johore. </p>
<p align="justify">322.    The defendant also alleged that the plaintiff

had improperly claimed against the Club insurance for his personal liability on costs in

Suit 23/88 and had misrepresented to the general membership issues relating to the

personal liability of GC members and the D &amp; O policy. The insurance policy was not

put in evidence and I do not know what its terms are. I cannot come to any conclusion

whether he had made any improper claims, or whether he had misrepresented to the insurance

company and the GC on any material facts or on the effect of those terms.</p>
<p align="justify">323.    Despite the fact that the plaintiff has obtained

a consent judgment against the 6 GC members for removing him on 31 March 1999 as their

vice-president (see the judgment of GP Selvam J reported in <i>Arul Chandran v Gartshore</i>
<nobr>[2000] 2 SLR 446</nobr> which was delivered on 10 March 2000), the defendant continued to cite

the plaintiff’s removal to show the low esteem that the GC members had of him. The

plaintiff’s removal took place well after the defamatory publications. I am not

prepared to infer that they must have viewed the plaintiff in a similar light at the time

of the publications the year before. </p>
<p align="justify">324.    In any case, the defendant failed to call any GC

member to testify that the GC members had generally viewed the plaintiff as a man with a

flawed character and a bad reputation at that time such that the publications by the

defendant had not further lowered the plaintiff in their estimation in any way.</p>
<p align="justify">325.    Instead of mitigating the damage as was

intended, I think that bringing an unsubstantiated allegation that the plaintiff generally

had a bad reputation is itself an aggravation of damage.</p>
<p align="justify">326.    Express malice is another ground to claim

aggravated damages. Evidence of matters tending to establish malice is as a general rule

relevant to support such a claim. The evidence is not limited to the conduct of the

defendant at the time of the libel but it extends to conduct up to the conclusion of the

trial. In view of my finding of express malice, the plaintiff is clearly entitled to

aggravated damages. </p>
<p align="justify">327.    The defendant’s failure to make out the

plea of justification also calls for increased damages as the plaintiff had to be and was

subjected to humiliating and embarrassing ‘put’ questions in cross-examination

arising from the justification defence adopted. </p>
<p align="justify">328.    The manner the defendant has through his counsel

conducted the cross-examination of the plaintiff is also relevant. Leaving aside the

embarrassing and humiliating questions, I do not think that both defence counsel in this

case have stepped so far outside the accepted boundaries in cross-examination, that it

calls for additional aggravated damages to be awarded. The extent of the plaintiff’s

participation in the Tara transactions must be severely tested by cross-examination in

order to discover the truth. Sufficient leeway to do this must be given to counsel. Though

there may be several questions repeated from time to time, this is inevitable having

regard to the length of the cross-examination, the numerous complicated factual issues at

the trial, the voluminous documents to be dealt with and the usual lapses of memory as to

what had already been asked. However, this by no means justifies increasing the aggravated

damages on account of the counsel’s lengthy and sometimes repetitive and convoluted

cross-examination. </p>
<p align="justify">329.    In conclusion, the main mitigating factor is the

very small circulation of the defamatory publications to only 10 persons. I cannot award

damages on account of other defamatory publications circulated extensively to other Club

members, which are not the subject matter of this defamation suit though they were adduced

in evidence to prove malice for which a separate award for aggravated damages has been

made. I am not awarding any exemplary damages because the defendant believed what the

learned judge said of the plaintiff. Had he not believed what he read in the judgment, I

may well award some exemplary damages to punish him for what he did.</p>
<p align="justify">330.    After considering all the aggravating and

mitigating factors, I think that a fair and reasonable amount to award is $100,000 as

damages and $50,000 as aggravated damages, making a total award of $150,000. Interest on

the judgment sum will be at 6% p.a. from the date of the service of the writ on the

defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">331.    I further order an injunction preventing the

defendant from further publishing any of the words and imputations that I have found to be

defamatory of the plaintiff. Being a prolific letter writer, a term used by Mr Cashin of

his own client, it behoves me to grant the injunction prayed for by the plaintiff. </p>
<p align="justify">332.    Finally, I order the defendant to pay costs to

the plaintiff to be taxed on a standard basis on the High Court scale although the amount

of damages recovered is less than $250,000. The plaintiff in my view has succeeded on

almost all the issues. I certify that the costs be assessed on the basis of two counsel

because this is a fairly complex case, which is difficult for one counsel to handle alone.
