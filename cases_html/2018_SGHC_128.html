Hours of work beyond the first eight hours on a rest day or public holiday fall into the overtime claim (see section 2(1) of the Act, which defines “overtime” as meaning the number of hours worked in any one day or in any one week in excess of the limits provided for in Part IV).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Employer’s position is that the Claimant is only entitled to the flat contractual rate of S$50 per day.

</div> The Claimant asserts that he is entitled to the rates under Part IV of the Act. The ACL found for the Employer. In her analysis, section 2(2) of the Act mandates that employees employed in an executive position and earning a basic salary not exceeding S$4,500 cannot avail themselves of the provisions of Part IV.

The ACL’s conclusion was that the best available record was the Employer’s Bored Pile Records, which was referred to as exhibit “R7”.

On appeal, the Claimant submits that this approach is inconsistent with section 37(3A)(a) and section 38(1)(b) of the Employment Act.

Order 55 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) is the governing order. Rule 2(1) therein provides that appeals to which Order 55 applies shall be “by way of rehearing”. This means that the court is not constrained to determine only whether the tribunal’s decision below was proper and/or contained manifest errors of fact and law. If it wishes to, the court in its discretion may consider all the evidence before it and go beyond determining the propriety of the tribunal’s decision or inquiring into whether there had been manifest errors of fact or law. However, the court does not bear an irrevocable burden to hear the matter anew so that the substantive merits fall to be determined afresh (<span class="font-italic">Valentino Globe BV v Pacific Rim Industries Inc</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 577 at [11], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ceramiche Caesar SpA v Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd </span>[2017] 2 SLR 308 at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The court hearing an appeal to which Order 55 applies “may give any judgment or decision or make any order which ought to have been given or made by the … tribunal … and make such further or other order as the case may require or may remit the matter with the opinion of the Court for rehearing and determination by it” (Order 55 rule 6(5) Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As is evident, Order 55 rule 6(5) confers broad discretion upon the court hearing an appeal from the decision of a tribunal when it comes to determining what to do with the case. Although appeals such as this application are “by way of rehearing” (Order 55 rule 2(1) Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)), “it is still important … to recognise that the judge having heard the evidence [is] in a better position to know all the circumstances than this court can be even with the assistance of transcripts” (<span class="font-italic">Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council </span>[1998] 1 WLR 1546 at 1554E, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Woolf MR, in relation to Order 59 rule 10(3) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965/1776) (UK), which was in substantially the same terms as Order 55 rule 6(5) of the Rules of Court). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It follows that in an appropriate case, the court hearing the appeal may decide to remit the matter with its opinion and directions for the tribunal below to reconsider the evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Cardshops Ltd v Davies and another </span>[1971] 1 WLR 591, where the English Court of Appeal remitted the case with directions to the county court judge for rent to be reconsidered accordingly).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is the Claimant entitled to rely on Part IV of the Act? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Claimant seeks to rely on Part IV of the Act to calculate the remuneration payable by the Employer to him for the work he did on <span class="font-italic">rest days</span> and <span class="font-italic">public holidays</span>.

</div> I find that this is in accordance with the second column of row two in the Fourth Schedule to the Employment Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Claimant’s “basic rate of pay” would be calculated based on the formula in the third column of row two in the Third Schedule to the Act: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Basic rate of pay for one day = </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(12 x monthly basic rate of pay) / (52 x number of days on which the employee is required to work in a week) =</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(12 x $2,200) / (52 x 5.5) = $92.31. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I turn then to remuneration for work done on public holidays.

They are not dealt with in Part IV. I note also that the basic distinction between a “rest day” and a “holiday” is that all employees are entitled to a paid holiday at his gross rate of pay on a public holiday. On the other hand, rest days are days of rest without pay. Further, an employee who works on a public holiday is entitled to be paid (i) his gross rate of pay; and (ii) an extra day of pay at the basic rate of pay. The special provisions on holiday pay in Part X are not subject to the exclusions applicable to Part IV, which are considered next.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Part IV is applicable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Section 35 provides, in brief, that Part IV applies to workmen receiving a salary less that S$4,500 per month and also to employees (other than workmen) who are in receipt of a salary less than S$2,500 per month.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affidavit of Koh Pei Ching, filed 10 January 2018, [21].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Section 2(1) defines an “employee” as “a person who has entered into or works under a contract of service with an employer and includes a workman … but does not include — … (c) subject to subsection (2), any person employed in a managerial or an executive position.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Section 2(2) goes on to provide that “[a]ny person who is employed in a managerial or an executive position and is in receipt of a salary not exceeding $4,500 a month … shall be regarded as an employee for the purposes of this Act except the provisions in Part IV”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Section 2(1) also defines “workman” as meaning (a) any person … engaged in manual labour; … (c) any person employed partly for manual labour and partly for the purpose of supervising in person any workman in and throughout the performance of his work…”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It will be apparent that the Act recognises a basic distinction between an “employee” and a “workman”, and between employees who are “managers or executives” and those who are not. In addition, a distinction is also drawn between workmen earning more than S$4,500 per month and those earning less, as well as employees earning more than S$2,500 per month and those who earn less.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The distinctions are important in that they relate to the applicability of some of the core provisions in the Act. For example, a person employed in a managerial or executive position is not regarded as an employee under the Act for the purposes of Part IV. It does not matter how much or how little he earns – as a manager or executive, he is not entitled to rely on the provisions in Part IV. That said, he is still entitled to assert and rely on the provisions in Part X on holiday and sick leave. Similarly, the provisions on maternity benefits and childcare leave in Part IX remain applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Prior to the 2008 amendments, employees who are employed in managerial or executive positions did not have access to the Labour Court for salary claims. It was thought that such employees “are generally in a better bargaining position” and hence do not need statutory protection (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 November 2008) vol 85 at cols 949—950 (Gan Kim Yong, Acting Minister for Manpower)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 During the Second Reading of the Employment (Amendment) Bill, however, the Acting Minister for Manpower, Mr Gan Kim Yong, explained that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… based on the Ministry’s experience, the most common type of assistance managers and executives require is the recovery of salary claims, especially those who are more junior and paid less. They often find it costly to take up civil suits to recover salary arrears. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Therefore, we will allow junior managers and executives earning $2,500 and below in basic monthly salary, to have access to the Labour Court for salary claims. With the increasing proportion of [professionals, managers, executives, and technicians], a significant number of employees will benefit from the access to this lower-cost dispute resolution mechanism. … This will benefit 44,000 [professionals, managers, executives, and technicians].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 So, section 2(2) was introduced to help a sandwiched class – sandwiched because they are not in the “worst of bargaining positions” such that the Act was already available for them, but who are also not in the best of positions when it comes to asserting their side of the bargain on their own. Section 2(2) was introduced by the Employment (Amendment) Act 2008 (No 32 of 2008) to confer greater statutory protection on employees who are employed in managerial or executive positions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 That was the genesis of section 2(2). It was amended in 2010 to raise the salary cap from S$2,500 to S$4,500 (see Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2010 (No 36 of 2010)), thereby expanding the pool of employees employed in managerial or executive positions who fell within its ambit. It was also amended to extend the range of provisions that such employees can have recourse to. Thus, while section 2(2) was initially confined to provisions relating to salary claims, it now applies to the whole of the Act "except the provisions in Part IV”.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 This brings us to Part IV. If the Employment Act is meant to “[safeguard] basic employment standards” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 November 2008) vol 85 at col 948 (Gan Kim Yong, Acting Minister for Manpower)), then Part IV is meant to “[provide] additional employment protection and benefits for the more vulnerable employees who are engaged in manual labour or are paid lower wages, such as machine operators and cleaners” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 November 2008) vol 85 at col 950 (Gan Kim Yong, Acting Minister for Manpower)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The class of employees that Part IV protects is quite clearly different from the class that section 2(2) seeks to extend protection to. Section 2(2) is meant to help managers and executives who receive less than S$4,500 per month. But this class of managers and executives was less likely to need the sort of protection accorded by Part IV. That is why managers and executive employees paid S$4,500 or more are excluded from Part IV although they are entitled to assert and rely on provisions in other Parts such as Part X on holiday and sick leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the present case, the distinctions drawn affect the applicability and operation of Part IV and Part X. In the case of an employee who is a manager or executive the combined effect of section 2(1) and 2(2) is that he will fall outside of the protections in Part IV of the Act. The managerial/executive employee can still rely on Part X although there are some differences between his position and employees who are not managers/executives (see section 88(4) and 88(4A)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 At the conclusion of the MOM Proceedings, the ACL found that the Claimant could not rely on Part IV to calculate remuneration due for the work he did within his normal hours of work on his <span class="font-italic">rest</span> days. This is because the Claimant was found to have been employed in an executive position (<span class="font-italic">supra </span>[7(a)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Section 35 tells us who Part IV covers. There are two groups. The first covers “workmen who are in receipt of a salary not exceeding S$4,500 a month (excluding overtime payments, bonus payments, annual wage supplements, productivity incentive payments and any allowance however described)” (section 35(a)). The second covers “employees (other than workmen) who are in receipt of a salary not exceeding S$2,500 a month (excluding overtime payments, bonus payments, annual wage supplements, productivity incentive payments and any allowance however described)” (section 35(b)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In oral submissions, Mr Chan argued that the Claimant is essentially a construction worker and entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Part IV by virtue of section 35(a) read together with section 2(1)(d) and the First Schedule to the Act. These provisions state that a workman includes “construction workers”. “Constructional work” is defined in section 2(1) as meaning “any building and civil engineering work and includes repair, maintenance, alteration and demolition work”. Whilst the Claimant was employed as a supervisor, Mr Chan’s position is that the Claimant remains a construction worker, albeit in a more supervisory role.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The ACL, in reaching her decision, noted the Claimant’s statement that he was not a workman and that he spent more than 80% of his time on supervision.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Neither side raised the issue as to whether this statement precluded the Court considering afresh the question whether the Claimant was in fact a workman. In my view, the Claimant’s statement that he was not a workman has to be taken in context: namely that he spent the bulk of his time on supervision as opposed to actually doing manual/construction work. This does not mean that as a matter of law, the Claimant is not a workman. Supervisory responsibility does not mean the person cannot be a workman. After all, section 2(1) includes under “workman” any person employed partly for manual labour and partly for the purpose of supervising in person any workman in and throughout the performance of his work. Indeed, section 2(1) also provides (in brief) that a person who is employed partly as a workman and partly in some other capacity is deemed to be a workman unless his work as a workman is less than one-half of his work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The fact of the matter is the Claimant was supervising “in person” the workmen in his team “in and throughout the performance of his work”. He was not supervising off-site or through chains of command.  For this reason, I am of the view that there is a good case to be made that the Claimant was a workman for the purposes of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, it is not necessary to reach a definite conclusion on this issue as I find that the Claimant was not in any case employed in an executive or managerial position. Section 35(b) applies Part IV to an employee (other than a workman) provided he is not employed in an executive or managerial position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There is no doubt that the Claimant was employed under a contract of service with the Employer. The only question is whether the Claimant was employed in an executive position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The term “executive position” is not defined in the Act. The word “executive” has been defined as referring to “[a] corporate officer at the upper levels of management” (<span class="font-italic">Black’s Law Dictionary </span>(Thomson Reuters, 9th Ed, 2009) at p 651). It is not difficult to imagine that such employees are likely to be in a better position to safeguard their own employment interests in respect of the matters falling within Part IV.  Thus, Assoc Professor Ravi Chandran, in <span class="font-italic">Employment Law in Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2017) at para [4.18], had this to say about why persons employed in executive positions are excluded from the definition of “employee” under section 2(1) of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The idea behind [section 2(1)] is likely that persons in … executive positions are <span class="font-italic">better able to protect their own interests and hence, do not need statutory protection.</span> <span class="font-italic">However, in reality that may not be the case except perhaps for very high level employees. Thus, it is suggested that this provision should be interpreted narrowly</span> <span class="font-italic">so as not to extend to a mere</span><span class="font-italic"> sales ‘executive’ for instance</span>. It is suggested that factors such as the nature of the job and the responsibilities of the employee, the qualifications of the employee and amount of remuneration payable to the employee should be taken into account in determining the issue [emphasis added].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Indeed, Assoc Professor Chandran’s views resonate with Parliament’s approach to determining which classes of employees should be given statutory protection. In that regard, it is clear that Parliament’s decision on whether to afford statutory protection to a class of employees depends heavily on whether that class of employees is able to safeguard its own interests independently of legislation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I have summarised above why Parliament decided to amend the Employment Act in 2008 to afford access to the Labour Court for managers and executives earning S$2,500 and below in basic monthly salary. The Acting Minister for Manpower had explained (<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [45]) that “managers and executives are also currently not covered as they are <span class="font-italic">generally in a better bargaining position</span> [emphasis added]” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 November 2008) vol 85 at cols 949—950 (Gan Kim Yong, Acting Minister for Manpower)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Subsequently, the Acting Minister also explained Parliament’s intention in introducing a S$4,500 monthly salary threshold for workmen in order for Part IV to apply. In this context, the Acting Minister said (at cols 950—951): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… highly paid and skilled workmen <span class="font-italic">are able to negotiate for favourable employment terms without having to be protected under Part IV</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, … we will introduce a basic monthly salary threshold of $4,500 for workmen under Part IV. Workmen with lower income will not be affected, and will continue to be protected under Part IV.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 And perhaps to concretise who this skilled workman, capable of negotiating for favourable employment terms without having to be protected under Part IV is, the Acting Minister stated (at col 951):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This change will affect a relatively small proportion of workmen, making up about 0.6% of all workmen, the majority of whom are employed in fewer than 10 companies in the petroleum, petrochemical and aerospace industries. The exclusion will provide these highly skilled workmen and their employers the flexibility to offer employment packages that better suit their needs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The courts will approach the question of whether an employee is employed in an executive position by looking at all the circumstances of the case. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Brightway Petrochemical Group Singapore Pte Ltd v Ang Lily </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 729 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Lily</span>”) illustrates this. Chan Seng Onn J held that the respondent employee in that case was not employed in an executive position. The appellant employer had sought to show that the respondent was employed in a managerial, executive or confidential position, arguing that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the employee was employed as an “accountant” and that was her job description or designation (<span class="font-italic">Ang Lily </span>at [9]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the employee’s job responsibilities included setting up the company accounts, which would require the expertise of a trained accountant (<span class="font-italic">Ang Lily </span>at [9]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the high salary paid while the employee was still on probation showed that she was not employed in a mere clerical or administrative position, but was instead employed in a position that required her to exercise managerial and executive functions (<span class="font-italic">Ang Lily </span>at [10]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that the role of an accountant was foundational to the appellant’s growing business. The respondent was the only accountant employed by the appellant at that time and was expected to carry out all the functions expected of a competent accountant (<span class="font-italic">Ang Lily </span>at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In rejecting the respondent’s arguments, Chan J found:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 … The respondent testified that she <span class="font-italic">reported to the finance manager</span>, which indicated to me that she was <span class="font-italic">playing more of a supportive role although her designation stated in the job offer letter was “accountant”</span>. According to the respondent, she was in a new set-up with only two of them in the finance department, namely, the finance manager and herself. Clearly, she did not have any supervisory functions or any staff under her charge. The respondent further testified that her work involved setting up the company’s accounts, filing of vendor bills, issuing cheques, preparing payment vouchers, creating petty cash and payment voucher forms, booking air tickets for the staff, arranging for interviews for candidates for the operation manager, making enquiries of the medical check-up procedures and performing other duties assigned by the finance manager. <span class="font-italic">Even though setting up the company’s accounts was one aspect of her work, I believed that she would probably be doing so under the direct supervision of the finance manager, whom she reported to</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 After considering <span class="font-italic">all the relevant circumstances and the nature of her employment</span>, I came to the … conclusion … that the respondent’s duties and responsibilities were predominantly administrative … in nature.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 At the appeal hearing, I queried <span class="font-italic">whether the respondent had a degree in accountancy, but was informed that she was a diploma holder.

He had to made [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] many decisions in the day to day operations. In fact, one such decision was to check and confirm the safety requirements have been complied with before the Permit to Work for excavation and piling works can proceed … The claimant can influence the workers and decide the manner in which they worked to meet the deadline. The claimant also had influence over his workers’ appraisal. The claimant had made recommendation to Mr Zhang … to promote or dismiss the workers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The main points in the ACL reasoning can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Claimant was a site supervisor.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As a site supervisor, the Claimant was in charge of his team and had to make many decisions on a daily basis, one of which was to confirm that safety requirements have been complied with before work can proceed for the day.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Claimant had influence over his workers’ appraisal and had made recommendations to promote or dismiss workers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Respectfully, I cannot see how these reasons are sufficient to show that the Claimant is employed in an executive position. To begin with, the fact that the Claimant was employed as a site supervisor is not sufficient by itself to lead to the conclusion that he is an executive. After all, the fact that a worker has a supervisory role does not even necessarily remove his status as a “workman.” Much must depend on the nature and level of supervisory powers that he has been given and all other relevant circumstances. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Ang Lily</span> (<span class="font-italic">supra </span>[64]), the fact that the employee was engaged as an “accountant” did not mean that she was in an executive position. Chan J examined the nature of her actual work and other factors including the point that the employee had a diploma instead of a degree in accountancy. This “fortified” Chan J’s view that she was not employed in a managerial, executive, or confidential position (at [15], <span class="font-italic">supra </span>[65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the present case, the Claimant does not have a diploma.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Accordingly, I reiterate my finding that Part IV of the Act applies to the Claimant. This means that the Claimant can rely on sections 37(2) or (3) as appropriate to calculate the amounts the Employer must pay to him for the work he did within his normal hours of work on <span class="font-italic">rest days</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first eight hours of work on rest days). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In particular, I note section 37(3) (relied on by the Claimant) that where an employee <span class="font-italic">at the request of the employer</span> works on a rest day, then if the period of work exceeds his normal hours of work for one day, the employee is entitled to a sum at the basic rate of pay for 2 days’ work <span class="font-italic">and</span> a sum not less than one and a half times his hourly basic rate of pay for each hour or part thereof that the period of work exceeds his normal hours of work for one day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 That said, as noted (<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [28]), under section 37(2) the rate of pay is lower if it was <span class="font-italic">the employee</span> <span class="font-italic">who made the request</span> to work on a rest day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 To be sure, my finding that the Claimant can avail himself of the provisions of Part IV does not affect his claims for payment for work done on <span class="font-italic">public holidays</span>. Payment for work done on public holidays is, after all, governed by section 88 of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 If the Claimant had worked on a public holiday, then he must be paid an “extra day’s salary at the basic rate of pay for one day’s work in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day” (section 88(4) of the Act). I have found that the Claimant’s basic rate of pay for one day is the same as his gross rate of pay for one day – S$92.31 (<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [34]). The Claimant shall, therefore, be paid S$184.62 per day for work done on a public holiday.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For avoidance of doubt, I also note that when asked by the ACL to state his claims at the start of the hearing below, the Claimant’s response was that his claim was for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One month’s salary in lieu of notice; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Overtime pay for the period 6 February 2015 to 31 December 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Claimant did not state to the ACL that there was also a claim to the higher rate of pay applicable when work was done on rest days or public holidays. However, I note also that in the submissions it is stated that aside from overtime, the Claimant is also claiming for work performed on rest days and public holidays in accordance with Part IV of the Employment Act.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I find it hard to accept the Employer’s new evidence that the Claimant was employed on the basis that he was not entitled to overtime payment. It certainly was not the view the Employer took at the hearing before the ACL. Quite apart from its evidence from the stand, if the Employer had genuinely taken that view, why did it adduce over 70 pages worth of bored pile records to contest the amount of overtime hours the Claimant had worked? This change in position casts serious doubt on the credibility of the Employer’s evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Even if, taking the Employer’s case at its highest, the Claimant was informed he was not entitled to overtime payment under his employment contract and that an express provision to that effect was set out in the contract, such a term cannot withstand the statutory regime. The Act provides that a term of the contract “which provides a condition of service which is less favourable to an employee than any of the conditions of service prescribed by this Act shall be illegal, null and void to the extent that it is so less favourable” (section 8 of the Act). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 An employee who comes within the provisions of Part IV of the Act is entitled to overtime payment at the rate stated under section 38(4). Essentially, the employee will have to be paid for overtime work “at the rate of not less than one and a half times his hourly basic rate of pay irrespective of the basis on which his rate of pay is fixed” (section 38(4) of the Act). This is the Basic Overtime Rate that parties did not dispute at the hearing before the ACL (<span class="font-italic">supra </span>[85]). It follows that this is the rate at which the Employer must remunerate the Claimant for the overtime work he did in the Relevant Period.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The question then is how best to determine the number of hours of overtime work the Claimant had done in the relevant period, that is, from 6 February 2015 to 31 December 2015?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Claimant claims for 1515 hours of overtime work over the Relevant Period broken down as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 6 February 2015 to 31 August 2015: 750 hours</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 1 September 2015 to 31 December 2015: 765 hours.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)   The handwritten note prepared by the Claimant setting out his estimated overtime hours (750 hours) for the period, 6 February 2015 to 31 August 2015. No weight was attached to this at all, as it was nothing more than the Claimant’s own estimate of what he claims as the overtime hours for this period. In essence, the handwritten note could not be used as evidence (proof) of its own truth. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Claimant’s own time cards for the period, 1 September 2015 to 31 December 2015, showing a total of 765 hours of overtime were not signed by the Project Supervisor. These were not official in that they had not been countersigned by the Project Manager. It appears that the ACL did, however, rely on these time cards for the limited purpose of opening the door towards reference to and use of the Bored Pile Records for the same period for the purpose of calculating overtime hours.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The time sheet record prepared by the Claimant for the workers in his team for 26 August 2015 to 3 January 2016 did not state the Claimant’s working hours and it was also unclear when the Claimant signed the time sheet record. The hours of work recorded for different workers varied. It appears that this time sheet record was not relied upon because of (i) issues of reliability (when was the record made); and (ii) issues of relevance (what inference could be drawn given the documents purported to be a time sheet record of other workers in his team).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The time cards of Mr Ferdausur were not official time cards. As a safety supervisor, he was not required to keep time cards.  Further, the hours of work the Claimant recorded in his own time cards for November to December 2015 were not always consistent with those in Mr Ferdausur’s time cards. On occasions, the Claimant’s time card indicated half an hour more working time. Further, Mr Ferdausur was in the process of bringing his own (separate) claim for overtime hours and accordingly had an interest in the case. Accordingly, it appears Mr Ferdausur’s time cards were not relied on for reasons similar to (c) above: (i) reliability; and (ii) relevance.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The time cards of Mr Saimun, Mr Faruk, Mr Atikan and Mr Shahin were discounted or not relied on because the Claimant was unable to recall when the cards were signed and because of some discrepancies between the days indicated for one worker and the days the Claimant claimed he had worked as part of the team. Once again, it appears these were essentially not taken into account also because of (i) reliability; and (ii) relevance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The ACL’s assessment was that even though the Bored Pile Records were not “the best record” for establishing what were the Claimant’s overtime hours, they were the best that were available in the circumstances. The ACL expressed reluctance to use the time cards of other workers as the basis of computing the Claimant’s working hours. Quite apart from reliability, there was the issue of relevance. Further, whilst there was no issue over the reliability of the tool box records, these were only available for 2 days. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ACL’s decision and the Bored Pile Records of 6 February 2015 to 13 August 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 At the hearing below, the Employer tendered complete sets of Bored Pile Records for the Relevant Period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 6 February 2015 to 31 December 2015).

The other Bored Pile Reports for the earlier period were returned to the Employer. It appears this was because the Claimant only supported his claim with time cards he had filled in himself for the period, 14 August 2015 to 31 December 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It, therefore, appears the ACL did at least refer to the fact that the Claimant put in his “unofficial” time cards for the limited purpose of recognising an overtime claim for the period, 14 August 2015 to 31 December 2015. After all, it was for this reason that the ACL accepted the Bored Pile Records for this period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99  There are, however, two difficulties. First, it appears that the ACL did not actually refer to the Bored Pile Records for this period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 14 August 2015 to 31 December 2015) when calculating the overtime hours. Instead, the ACL referred to and used the Employer’s own calculation of overtime hours for this period as set out in Exhibit R7. On appeal, the Claimant submits that the Employer’s calculation as summarised and set out in R7 was incorrect. For example, R7 states that no piling work was done on 11 September 2015 as that was a public holiday. This could not be correct because the Bored Pile Record for 11 September 2015 indicated piling works started at 9.00 am and finished at 6.30 pm.

Against this, the Claimant’s time card submitted by the Employer for 25 October 2015 showed that he worked from 7.30 pm to 8.00 am. The Claimant also complains that the Employer did not provide the Bored Pile Record for 25 October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Claimant also submits that errors were also made in calculating the hours of bored piling work on some days recognised in R7 as days when piling was done. For example, R7 states that piling work on 1 September 2015 commenced at 1.30 pm and ended at 11.00 pm which amounted to half an hour’s overtime. But the Bored Pile Records for that date shows that bored piling works started at 9.30 am and ended at 10.15 pm. This time period is also consistent with what was recorded in the Claimant’s own time card for September 2015.

I note also that some of the documents set out in the affidavits as exhibits such as HS-5 are hard to read/decipher because the print is faint or unclear. The same is true of some of the Employer’s exhibits such as the time cards found at R1. That aside, it does appear that the Employer’s calculation of overtime hours as set out in R7 and relied on by the ACL are not accurate and are likely to have understated the actual overtime hours. It would have been preferable if the ACL had assessed the overtime working hours directly from the Bored Pile Records or to have asked the parties to come to an agreement as to what the hours of work were based on the actual Bored Pile Records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The second problem is that R7 sets out the Employer’s calculation of overtime hours for the whole of the relevant period including February to August 2015. It will be recalled (<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [97]) that the ACL returned the Bored Pile Records for this period on the basis that these would not be looked at since the Claimant had not put in any of his own time cards for this period. That said, the ACL did award 185 hours of overtime for this period based on R7. But it is clear that the ACL could not have checked against the actual Bored Pile Records for February to August 2015, as she had returned them. Instead, the ACL simply accepted the Employer’s own calculation and summary as set out in R7. Thus, whilst the ACL did make an award of overtime for February to August 2015, the Claimant’s complaint is (i) the actual Bored Pile Records were not even before the ACL;

The ACL’s decision was that the onus of proof was on the Claimant to prove the overtime hours. The ACL did not accept the Bored Pile Records for this period because the Claimant did not submit any time cards. What was left was a handwritten note prepared by the Claimant setting out his own estimate of the overtime hours in this period.

</div> According to the ACL, this was because the Employer’s business was in bored piling, and the Bored Pile Records were the official records of the Employer’s. The Bored Pile Records showed the different stages of the bored piling and the times when the piling was done. The Claimant signed off on the Bored Pile Records. The premise is that so long as bored piling was taking place, one can safely infer that the Claimant would be working. In the ACL’s view, therefore, these records were the best and most accurate measure of the amount of overtime work the Claimant had done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Based on the Employer’s calculation and table summary of bored piling work hours at R7, the total overtime from 6 February 2015 to 31 December 2015 was assessed by the ACL at 289 hours.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I agree with the ACL that the Bored Pile records would reflect <span class="font-italic">some</span> of the work the employees did.

</div> It was clearly important that they should be standing ready to attend to any matters that might arise during or after the bored piling as necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 It follows that the Employer cannot say that just because the Claimant was waiting (or on stand-by) while bored piling was ongoing, he was not doing work and therefore ought not to be remunerated for his hours at work. To be clear, there is nothing to suggest that the ACL actually discounted hours in the Bored Piling Records on account of any suggestion that there would be time periods when the Claimant had no work to carry out. The above comments are made in response to submissions made before this Court. The problem, however, remains that the ACL did not appear to assess the hours directly from the Bored Pile Records and instead relied on the Employer’s summary in R7.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Should the ACL have awarded an uplift to the work hours as recorded in the Bored Pile Records?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 There is no doubt that exclusive reliance on the Bored Pile Records will lead to an under-estimation of the Claimant’s actual hours worked in the relevant period. To be clear, even if the complete set of Bored Pile Records was available and referred to, it is likely that the Claimant’s actual working hours would exceed the figures revealed for the reasons that have been referred to above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The problem, however, is that it may not be that easy to determine the appropriate “uplift” to the hours as calculated by reference to the Bored Pile Records.

If required to, however, workers would sometimes work beyond the shift hours, as would the Claimant. At the end of each shift, the supervisor of that shift would hand over the work to the supervisor of the next shift.

</div> This meant that, instead of working 12-hour day shifts or night shifts, once the Claimant’s team started work on the construction of a specific bored pile, his work shift will continue until the completion of work on that particular bored pile. The Claimant gave evidence that he and his team would typically start work at 7.30 am, and that a typical shift would often end late at night. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Once again, given the fact that there are clear errors in R7 and the Employer’s summary and table of working hours based on the Bored Pile Records, it must follow that the overtime hours should at the very least be re-calculated by reference to the actual Bored Pile Records (where these are available) for this period.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 What remains is again the question of an uplift to the hours calculated solely by reference to the Bored Pile Records. There is likely to be a substantial difference between the hours calculated based on the Bored Pile Records and the hours claimed in the unofficial time cards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 One approach may be to run through the time cards of the other workers (including Mr Ferdausur), toolbox meeting forms (where available) and to compare these with the time cards of the Claimant. Are the hours claimed generally consistent bearing in mind that the Claimant as the supervisor of his team may well start/finish work before and after workmen in his team? Given that the time cards of the Claimant and Mr Ferdausur are unofficial and un-endorsed, it may also be appropriate to discount the hours set out in the time card in recognition of the possibility of error. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The reservations of the ACL in paying regard to the time cards of other workers under the Claimant (including Mr Ferdausur) is understandable. That said, the whole point of the exercise of comparing different workers’ time cards and time sheets is not to look for absolute precision, but to look for a broad measure of regularity that paints a picture consistent with the evidence given. In a non-automated system of time recording, it is only to be expected that the timings recorded will not be accurate to the second or even to the minute. Moreover, even in situations where workers work in the same shift, there may be some minor differences in the timings recorded on different workers’ time cards as a result of exigencies at work, for example, that may cause one worker to clock-off or clock-in at a time slightly different from another worker’s in his shift. The principal duties of the workers are to work and not to keep a detailed and meticulous record of their hours of work. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">November to December 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Claimant’s evidence is that sometime in November 2015, the Employer reverted to the shift system in which teams worked either the day or night shift.

</div> and that this did not necessarily mean that the Employer gave the requisite notice of termination of his employment. That may well be so. Nevertheless, the fact remains that there is evidence he was given a timely notice of termination. In light of this, I agree with the ACL’s decision to dismiss the Claimant’s claim for one month’s salary in lieu of notice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150      <span class="font-italic">Employment Law in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>(Benjamin Yim, ed) (Academy Publishing, 2016) comments at para [1.3] that “the Employment Act has evolved to serve a dual role – to safeguard employment rights, with particular protection for more vulnerable workers; and to regulate employment relations by ascertaining the rights and obligations of employers and employees, and providing mechanisms for effective employment dispute resolution.” The present case largely concerns an employee’s right in respect of remuneration for overtime work and work performed on rest days and public holidays. Leaving aside civil proceedings, in some cases, breaches by the employer are also covered by criminal offences such as section 53 which deals with failure to pay salary in accordance with Part IV.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The effective operation of the Act, including Part IV and Part X, depends on a proper system of records that tracks an employee’s or workman’s hours of work in the first place. <span class="font-italic">Employment Law in Singapore </span>comments at para [1.16] that the 2015 amendments to the Employment Act were primarily concerned with new requirements on employers to maintain proper employment records and to provide key employment terms and payslips to their employees. To be clear, this case does not concern the criminal provisions in the Employment Act or the statutory provisions on record keeping. The point that is made is a general one: without proper records of hours of work and work performed on rest days and public holidays, it is not surprising if disputes arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In the present case, Mr Chan submitted that in rejecting the documentary records the Claimant kept in support of his claims, the ACL had effectively allowed the Employer to rely on its own unfair practices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The evidence as to the system in place for recording hours of work for supervisors was confusing. On the one hand, it appears that no time cards were required for supervisors like the Claimant and Mr Ferdausur. Indeed, not only were these not required but when the Claimant tried to submit time cards these were rejected as being unnecessary.

</div>
</div> It was only sometime in August 2015 when, according to the Claimant, there was an increase in hours of work that he decided to keep his own unofficial time cards (September to December 2015) once again. These were rejected by the ACL as they were not countersigned by the Project Manager. The difficulty the Claimant was in was that when he tried to submit the time cards in the earlier period to the Employer, they were not accepted. But, on the other hand, the Employer testified that it would have paid overtime if the Claimant presented his time card for verification. It also took the position that the only reason why it did not pay the Claimant’s overtime was because the Claimant did not submit his time cards for verification. If this was so, then one would have, at the very least, expected that the Employer would require an employee in the Claimant’s shoes to keep time cards to support his overtime claims. One would also have expected that the Employer would have in place some form of record-keeping to track workers’ hours of work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 It is, therefore, surprising that the transcript of the proceedings before the ACL makes clear that this was not so:

Moreover, the Employer’s evidence appears to suggest that supervisors like the Claimant do not perform much overtime work. Yet the Employer’s own summary and table (R7) of overtime hours based on the Bored Pile Records recognises overtime hours for every month in the relevant period (except December 2015). If supervisors were not required to submit time cards, it may be thought that, perhaps, that there is another system of tracking attendance. Yet, the “time machine” was down since August 2015. In any case, the “time machine” does not seem like a very reliable attendance tracker because in the Employer’s own testimony, it “relied more on the workers’ time card more than the record provided by the time machine in paying overtime”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 To be clear, the ACL’s discomfort with relying solely on the Claimant’s unendorsed time cards is understandable. As these are records that the Claimant kept on his own without corroboration, there is a risk that they may not be entirely accurate. An employer’s endorsement would have served as corroboration. But the Employer apparently told the Claimant there was no need to endorse. What is clear is that the system for recording the hours of work of supervisors like the Claimant was unclear and, in any case, not well implemented. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The present case underscores the importance of Employers keeping and maintaining proper records of hours of work on work days, rest days and public holidays. Indeed, it is perhaps especially important that there are proper records of hours of work performed on any given day over and above the normal working hours. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I now summarise the findings of the Court and the directions that it makes in this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 First, save for the matter of payment of salary in lieu of one month’s notice, the Claimant succeeds in the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Second, I am of the view that it is appropriate to remit the matter back to the ACL for re-consideration in light of the findings I have made. The ACL has heard the witnesses and will be in the best position to examine the actual Bored Pile Records for the relevant period and to come to a considered decision as to the hours of work as revealed by the actual Bored Pile Records. Whether the parties are able to come to an agreement as to what the correct hours are by reference to the actual Bored Pile Records for the whole of the relevant period is for the parties and I make no further comment on this. In addition, the ACL is also in the best position to determine the appropriate uplift to those hours based on the evidence as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161  In coming to the decision to remit the matter to the ACL, I note that this is also desirable as the copies of the records and other documents before me in the Record of Proceedings and Affidavits are often hard to read because of the quality of the reproduction. I accordingly order that this case be remitted and the evidence re-considered by, as far as practicable, the ACL herself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 For convenience, I summarise my main findings against which the ACL is to reconsider the claim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Claimant is not employed in an executive or managerial position.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Claimant is entitled to the protection and benefits of Part IV of the Employment Act. In particular, the Claimant is entitled to:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The benefit of section 37 which deals with the employee’s right of remuneration for work done on a rest day. Section 37 is to be applied bearing in mind the distinction where an employee requests to work on a rest day and where an employee was asked to work on a rest day.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The benefit of section 38 which deals with hours of work and in particular section 38(4) and payment for extra work (ordinarily over eight hours a day or 44 hours a week) at the rate of not less than one and a half times his hourly basic rate of pay.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The benefit of section 88(4) which states that where an employee is required to work on a public holiday he shall be paid an extra day’s salary at the basic rate of pay for one day’s work in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day etc. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) The Claimant’s basic rate of pay for one day is the same as his gross rate of pay for one day – S$92.31. The Claimant shall therefore be paid S$184.62 per day for work done on a public holiday.   </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) The Basic Overtime Rate the Claimant is entitled to is S$17.31 per hour of work.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Claimant is entitled to overtime pay from February to December 2015. In assessing the overtime hours, the ACL must consider the Bored Piling Records for the entire period. To be clear, the Employer’s summary and Table based on the Employer’s assessment of the Bored Piling Records (R7) must be verified so far as possible against the actual Bored Piling Records (where available).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) After assessing the overtime hours based on the actual Bored Piling Records, the ACL is to consider what uplift to the number of overtime hours is supported by the evidence as a whole including the Claimant’s own time cards, the time cards of other workers/employees (where available) and the toolbox records. The appropriate uplift is a matter of judgment which is perhaps best approached on the basis of the goal of being “roughly right.” For example, if the tenor of the evidence is consistent with the Supervisor needing to spend an hour or so at work, such as preparing/conducting tool box meetings for his workers obtaining permits and that this is outside of what is captured by the Bored Pile Records, this might form the basis for an uplift. Alternatively, if the evidence indicates that approximately 20% of the Claimant’s work involved matters not directly captured by the Bored Pile Records then it might be appropriate to award an uplift on that basis. In other words, that on a balance of probabilities the case has been made out for a 20% uplift to the Bored Pile Record hours in the assessment of overtime hours. These are, of course, just examples to illustrate the approach that might be taken to the evidence as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Thereafter, the Claimant’s entitlement to overtime pay is to be assessed in accordance with the rates set out above. The Claimant is also entitled to be paid for work done (within normal hours) on rest days and public holidays in accordance with section 37(3) and section 88(4).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Costs are awarded in favour of the Claimant to be agreed, and if not agreed, taxed. Whilst the Claimant lost on the issue in respect of one month pay in lieu of notice, I am of the view that it is appropriate to award the Claimant his costs without discount.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I thank learned counsel for both parties for their efforts and, in particular, learned counsel for the Claimant for his detailed submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Kah Keen Melvin and Tan Tho Eng (TSMP Law Corporation) for the applicant;<br/>Tng Kim Choon (KC Tng Law Practice) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
