        Lee Seiu Kin J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 27 May 2008, Lai Siu Chiu J
                    (“Lai J”) gave interlocutory judgment in favour of the
                    plaintiff against the three defendants in this action. Her written judgment is
                    reported in [2008] 3 SLR(R) 981 (“the High Court
                    Judgment”). Lai J ordered damages to the plaintiff to be assessed by
                    the Registrar. All three defendants appealed and the Court of Appeal dismissed
                    the appeal on 14 November 2008. The written judgment of the Court of
                    Appeal is reported in [2009] 1 SLR(R) 524 (“the CA
                    Judgment”). As the facts are amply set out in both judgments, I will not
                    repeat them here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The assistant registrar (“the
                    AR”), in notice of assessment no 47 of 2009, heard
                    evidence on damages and made the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     That judgment be entered for the
                        plaintiff in the sum of $6,661,092.07, the breakdown of which is as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       sponsorship sums of
                            $6,155,250.00 paid by the plaintiff to the 1st
                        defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       wasted man-hour costs in the sum of
                        $493,162.60;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       payment in the sum of $7,585.20 to Conflo
                        Marketing;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       payment in the sum of $52.06 to SMG RCG;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       payment in the sum of
                            $4,882.21 to Singapore Airlines; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       payment in the sum of $160.00 to
                            Mr Patrick Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     That cost of the assessment fixed at $60,000.00 excluding
                        reasonable disbursements to be paid forthwith by the defendants to the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     That
                        the defendants pay the plaintiff pre-judgment interest as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       interest on the sponsorship
                            sum of $6,155,250.00 computed from 11 August
                        2005;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       interest on the wasted man-hours of $493,162.60 computed from
                            5 January 2006;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       interest on the special damages computed from
                            the date the expenses were disbursed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       any interest accruing up to
                            31 March 2007 to be computed at 6% per annum and any interest
                            accruing from 1 April 2007 to be computed at 5.33% per
                            annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The third defendant appealed before me against
                    the decision of the AR. After hearing counsel for the parties on
                    8 February 2010, I dismissed the appeal and now give my grounds of
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Item a - $6,155,250.00 Sponsorship Sum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Counsel for the third defendant,
                    Mr Srinivasan, submitted that as Lai J had held that there was a
                    Quistclose trust in respect of the $6,155,250 (“the Sponsorship
                    Sum”) advanced by the plaintiff to the first defendant, the defendants
                    were entitled to such legitimate expenses that they could prove had been
                    incurred. However upon perusing the High Court Judgment at [158] and the CA
                    Judgment at [9], there is no doubt that the order was for the refund of the
                    Sponsorship Sum in full. Indeed the Court of Appeal had explicitly stated that
                    “there was an unequivocal obligation to refund the moneys in full to the
                    respondent if the Event was not staged”. I noted also that both the High
                    Court and Court of Appeal had noted that the defendants had no intention to
                    stage the event in Singapore. Therefore the AR was correct in ordering the
                    return of the Sponsorship Sum in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In any event, even if the third
                    defendant’s position was correct in principle, I did not see how it could
                    be entitled to any expenses in the circumstances. Under the first agreement, the
                    defendants would have been obliged to refund the Sponsorship Sum in full should
                    the first defendant fail to confirm that it had raised core finance by a certain
                    date. It was due to this failure that the plaintiff entered into the second
                    agreement. However the court found that during this time the defendants were
                    secretly making arrangements to stage the event in New York instead of
                    Singapore. Indeed the Court of Appeal had described this as a “carefully
                    orchestrated pretence” at [6] of the CA Judgment. Since the defendants
                    had no intention of staging the event in Singapore, whatever expenses incurred
                    could not have been for the purpose of staging the event in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Item b - $493,162.60 Wasted Man-hour cost</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Srinivasan did not dispute that that the
                    sum of $493,162.60 was expended by the plaintiff. His point was simply that most
                    of these expenses were incurred before the third agreement had come in force. I
                    did not agree with this argument as the third agreement had been rescinded by
                    the court (at [161] of the High Court Judgment) and the position of the parties
                    reverted to that of the second agreement. Given the finding by the court that
                    the activities carried out by the defendants were nothing but a charade, or as
                    the CA Judgment put it at [4], “an elaborate charade”, the
                    plaintiff had undertaken activities pursuant to the second agreement for nought.
                    Therefore the defendants are liable for those expenses incurred by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The third defendant’s appeal was
                    accordingly dismissed with costs.</p>
