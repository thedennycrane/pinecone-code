<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Both Martek Biosciences Corporation (the
                    “Applicant”) and Cargill International Trading Pte Ltd (the
                    “Respondent”) are in the infant formula business. The Respondent
                    commenced proceedings to revoke the Applicant’s Singapore Patent P-No.
                    42669 (“the Patent”) under section 80(1)(a) and (c) of the Patents
                    Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed). After a four-day hearing, Deputy Registrar
                    of Patents Danielle Yeow and Principal Assistant Registrar of Patents Isabel
                    Chng (“the Tribunal”) in <em>Cargill International
                        Trading Pte Ltd v Martek Biosciences Corporation</em> SGIPOS 12 (the
                    “grounds of decision”) granted the Respondent’s application
                    to revoke the Applicant’s patent. In this Originating Summons (“the
                    Appeal”), the Applicant is appealing against the decision of the
                    Tribunal. The Appeal has not been heard yet. What is presently in issue is an
                    interlocutory application by the Applicant for leave to adduce further evidence
                    at the Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Patent was entitled “Arachidonic Acid
                    and Methods for the production and use thereof” and the published
                    abstract reads as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The present invention relates to processes for the production of
                        arachidonic acid containing oils, which preferably are free of
                        eicosapentaneoic acid. This invention also relates to compositions
                        containing oils of very high amounts of arachidonic acid in triglyceride
                        form, and to uses of such oils. In a preferred embodiment, <em>Mortierella alpina</em> is cultivated using conditions
                        which yield triglyceride oil having particularly high levels of arachidonic
                        acid residues, biomass is harvested and the oil is extracted, recovered, and
                        used as an additive for infant formula.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Patent further explained the nature and
                    functions of arachidonic acid: that it serves a primary role as a structural
                    lipid and acts as the direct precursor for a number of circulating eicosenoids
                        [<em>eg</em>, Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>
                        (PGE<sub>2</sub>), prostacyclin I<sub>2</sub>
                        (PGI<sub>2</sub>), thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>
                        (TxA<sub>2</sub>), leukotrienes B<sub>4</sub>
                        (LTB<sub>4</sub>) and leukotrienes C<sub>4</sub>
                        (LTC<sub>4</sub>)] which exhibit regulatory effects on
                    lipoprotein metabolism, blood theology, vascular tone, leucocyte function and
                    platelet activation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Despite its importance to human metabolism,
                    arachidonic acid cannot be synthesized in humans <em>de
                        novo</em>. Thus, it must be provided in the diet and this is
                    especially important during times of very rapid body growth such as infancy.
                    Human breast milk contains high levels of arachidonic acid. However, many
                    mothers do not breast feed their infants or do not breast feed for the entire
                    period of rapid infant growth, choosing instead to utilize an infant
                    formula.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Patent stated that no commercial infant
                    formula known to the Applicant contained arachidonic acid in triglyceride form
                    and it also cited some unsuccessful attempts made in the quest for obtaining
                    arachidonic acid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent, in its application to revoke the
                    Patent, cited ten prior art enumerated D1 to D10 respectively. The Respondent
                    alleged that the Applicant’s patent claims were not patentable and that
                    the patent specification did not disclose the invention clearly and completely
                    for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Pleadings to the revocation proceedings
                    commenced on 20 January 2006. The revocation hearing was conducted before
                    the Tribunal from 9 to 12 February 2009. The Tribunal rendered its grounds
                    of decision on 3 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the Appeal, the Applicant will be contending
                    that the Tribunal erred in law and in fact in finding, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that:</p>

                            lacked an inventive step;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Claims 3, 26 and 36 were not novel and/or

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Pending the hearing of the Appeal, the Applicant
                    took out Summons No 234 of 2010/Q (“the application”)
                    pursuant to Order 55 rule 6(2) and/or Order 87A rule 13(2)
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed.)
                    (“ROC”) to apply for leave to conduct the experiment described in
                    prior art reference D4a and to adduce evidence of and relating to the same
                    (“the fresh evidence”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     D4 (D4a being the English translation of D4,
                    the original Japanese text) was a document cited by the Respondent as one of the
                    prior art references before the Tribunal. During cross-examination before the
                    Tribunal, it transpired that the Respondent’s witness, Dr. William R.
                    Barclay (“Dr. Barclay”), had not personally conducted the
                    experiment described in D4a.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The adduction of further evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As this was the first case in Singapore which
                    involved an application to adduce further evidence for a patents revocation
                    appeal against a Tribunal’s decision, counsels for the Applicant and the
                    Respondent sought to draw analogies with adduction of further evidence:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In an appeal from a lower court, tribunal or
                            person to the High Court pursuant to O 55 r 6(2)

                            of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev. Ed.)

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The principles governing the adduction of
                    further evidence appear to differ according to the nature of appeal from a lower
                    adjudicating body to an appellate body. Hence, an analysis of the nature of an
                    appeal from the Registrar of Patents (<em>ie</em>, the
                    Tribunal) to the High Court is useful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Nature of Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     O 87A r 13(2) ROC which governs the
                    nature of an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Patents (<em>ie</em>, the Tribunal) to the High Court applies to the
                    present application:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of appeal under O 87A is akin to that under O 55
                ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Applicant submitted that in
                    “rehearing” the Appeal, this court is entitled to revisit the
                    totality of the evidence tendered before the Tribunal below. In other words, the
                    Applicant pitched its case as such: an appeal from the Patents Registrars to the
                    High Court under O 87A r 13(2) ROC is analogous to that of an appeal
                    from a tribunal to the High Court under O 55 r 2(1) ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Following this logic, when hearing the Appeal,
                    this court is not fettered by any principle limiting its discretion and is free
                    to come to conclusions which differ from the conclusions of the Tribunal. As the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius and another v Tan
                        Harry and another</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 588 at [15]
                        (“<em>Teo Chee Yeow</em>”) held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hen a judge in chambers hears an appeal from a decision of the
                        Registrar, the judge is not exercising an appellate jurisdiction but a
                        confirmatory jurisdiction. In such an appeal, there is a rehearing and the
                        judge is entitled to exercise an unfettered discretion of his own.</p>

          <em>Teo Chee Yeow</em> at

                            the Court of Appeal.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In the case of (b) above, it was held that the Court of Appeal could
                    only upset a decision of the High Court if it was shown that the latter had
                    erred on a matter of principle, had taken irrelevant considerations into account
                    or that the decision was plainly wrong (see <em>The Vishva
                        Apurva</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 912).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Thus, the Applicant’s stance was that
                    the nature of the Appeal was akin to one under O 55 r 2(1) ROC in
                    which the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles were not of
                    assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Authorities from UK Trade Marks appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Applicant also sought to demonstrate, by
                    way of analogy, that a series of UK trade marks cases had held that the
                    restrictive principles expressed in <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> did not apply where the question was whether a party
                    should be allowed to file further evidence on a trade mark appeal from the
                    Registrar of Trade Marks to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It was submitted that the principles
                    enunciated in these UK trade marks cases should apply with equal force to the
                    application as any distinction between the principles applicable to adduction of
                    further evidence in a trade marks appeal and those relating to a patents appeal
                    to the High Court was illusory insofar as trade marks and patents were both
                    statutorily created intellectual property rights which conferred statutory
                    monopolies on their proprietors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As Lloyd J held in <em>ELLE Trade Marks</em> [1997] FSR 529 at 536 (“<em>ELLE Trade Marks</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> does not
                        apply to an appeal from the Registrar to the High Court, although it no
                        doubt would apply if there were a further appeal from this court [<em>ie</em>, the High Court of England] to the Court of
                        Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>ELLE Trade Marks</em> thus stands for the
                    proposition that the rule in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    applies only to an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal but not to
                    an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Applicant submitted that the above reason
                    compounded with the identical wording of O 87 r 4(2) ROC (which
                    governs the adduction of evidence in trade marks appeals) and that of O 87A
                    r 13(2) ROC (on patents appeals) warranted an equal application of the
                    principle in <em>ELLE Trade Marks</em> to the present
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The case of <em>Julian
                        Higgins’ Trade Mark Application</em> [2000] RPC 321
                        (“<em>Julian Higgins’</em>”) lends
                    force to the Applicant’s position. As observed by Sir Richard Scott VC at
                    326, in the UK, the introduction of new evidence on an appeal was governed by s
                    18(8) Trade Marks Act 1938 which allowed new evidence to be adduced either
                    “in the manner prescribed” or with “by special leave of the
                    court”. Since nothing had been prescribed, new material could only be
                    adduced with the leave of the court. Leave, in turn, would be granted according
                    to Order 55 rule 7(2) of the UK Rules of the Supreme Court (“UK
                    RSC”) which is now in Schedule I to the UK Civil Procedure
                Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     O 55 r 7(2) of the UK RSC read as
                    follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court shall have the power to receive further evidence on questions of
                        fact, the evidence may be given in such manner as the court may direct
                        either by oral examination in court or by witness statement or affidavit, by
                        deposition taken before an examiner or in some other manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sir Richard Scott VC contrasted the language of O 55 r 7(2)
                    UK RSC with that of O 59 r 10(2) UK RSC which applied to the admission
                    of new evidence in appeals to the Court of Appeal. O 59 r 10(2) of the
                    UK RSC stipulated as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal shall have power to receive further evidence on
                        questions of fact, either by oral examination in court, by affidavit, or by
                        deposition taken before an examiner, but in the case of an appeal from a
                        judgment after trial or hearing of any cause or matter on the merits,
                            <em>no such further evidence (other than evidence as to
                            matters which have occurred after the date of the trial or hearing)
                            shall be admitted except on special grounds</em>. (emphasis
                        added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It was held in <em>Julian
                        Higgins’</em> (at 327) that since the less restrictive language
                    of O 55 r 7(2) UK RSC was to be applied in that instance (<em>ie</em>, an appeal under the Trade Marks Act), <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>, which spelt out the manner in which the
                    courts were to approach the exercise of discretion to admit further evidence
                    under O 59 r 10(2) UK RSC, was not thought to be of any assistance.
                    This approach was endorsed by the case of <em>Club Europe Trade
                        Mark</em> [2000] RPC 329 at 338 which further emphasised
                    that <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles only applied to
                    appeals to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Applicant further pointed out that the
                    strict language of O 59 r 10(2) UK RSC (which <em>Ladd
                        v Marshall</em> principles reflected) was closely mirrored by
                    O 57 r 13(2) ROC (<em>ie</em>, appeals from High
                    Court to the Court of Appeal) which stipulates as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal shall have power to receive further evidence on
                        questions of fact, either by oral examination in Court, by affidavit, or by
                        deposition taken before an examiner, but, in the case of an appeal from a
                        judgment after trial or hearing of any cause or matter on the merits,
                            <em>no such further evidence (other than evidence as to
                            matters which have occurred after the date of trial or hearing) shall be
                            admitted except on special grounds</em>. (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the Applicant submitted that the strict language in O 57
                    r 13(2) ROC should be distinguished from the wider language employed by
                    O 87A r 13(2) ROC (which applied to the application). Moreover, as
                    there was no requirement for “special grounds” under O 87A
                    r 13(2) ROC, the principles of <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> were accordingly inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Applicant submitted that the test in
                        <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s Trade Mark Application</em>
                    [1996] RPC 233 (“<em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s
                        case</em>”) was the appropriate one for the
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Laddie J in <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s case</em>, which was an appeal to the High
                    Court of England from an opposition decision of the UK Registrar of Trade Marks,
                    noted that the repercussions of adducing evidence at a later stage in cases of
                    private litigation involving two parties (as was in <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em>) could be different from those in trade mark
                    opposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In a case of private litigation between two
                    parties, if one of them failed to produce evidence which was relevant and
                    helpful until too late, only that party would suffer the consequences. However,
                    in a case of opposition of trade mark, refusing permission to an opponent who
                    filed evidence late affected not only him but may also penalise the rest of the
                    trade as a new statutory monopoly would have been created. The possibility of
                    multiplicity of proceedings, as the party who loses as a result of the exclusion
                    of further evidence might return in a separate proceeding to seek rectification
                    of the procedure, would also be avoided by allowing fresh evidence at the appeal
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The factors enunciated by Laddie J at 242

                            significantly prejudiced by the admission of the evidence in a way which
                            cannot be compensated, <em>eg</em>, by an order for

                        case</em> granted leave to the opponent to file further evidence,
                    despite the fact that such an evidence should have been obtained prior to the
                    opposition hearing before the UK Registrar of Trade Marks and the fact that no
                    explanation was offered by the opponent for its failure to rely on the evidence
                    earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Taking into account all the relevant factors,

                    to adduce the fresh evidence on the following grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">As the Appeal is by way of rehearing, this court

                            doing so arose out of the cross-examination of the Respondent’s
                            witness, Dr. Barclay;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The fresh evidence was highly relevant for the
                            purposes of the Appeal as D4a was a prominent feature in the

                            Appeal;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The filing of the fresh evidence would probably
                            have an important influence on the outcome of the Appeal as the Tribunal
                            would have arrived at differing findings and conclusions had the fresh

                            monopoly conferred by the Patent, the Appeal should be based on a

                    determination of the issues in the Appeal based on all available evidence,
                    including the fresh evidence, would thus provide greater certainty and finality
                    for both parties. Therefore, taking into account all the relevant <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s case</em> factors, in the absence of
                    any prejudice to the Respondent, the overriding interests of justice, certainty
                    and finality should prevail to warrant the admission of the fresh

          <em>MediaCorp</em> was an
                    appeal by MediaCorp pursuant to s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) and s
                    8(3) of the Trade Marks Act to oppose the registration of the “Astro

                    Seiu Kin J considered the standard of review applicable to the proceedings
                    and noted that the earlier Court of Appeal case of <em>Future

                    noted at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nevertheless, the fact that such proceedings are “by way of
                        rehearing” does not necessarily mean that the appeal court’s
                        decision is unfettered. An appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal
                        is similarly by way of rehearing under O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC.
                        However, the Court of Appeal will be slow to upset an exercise of discretion
                        by the trial judge (<em>Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd v

                    at [26] distinguished between two instances:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A finding of facts where the Court of Appeal is
                            “generally reluctant to interfere because the trial judge is in a

                            where in respect of the latter “an appellate court is in as good
                            a position as the trial court to make an evaluation from primary
                            facts” (<em>Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered

<p class="Judg-1">Thus, Lee J referred to <em>Future
                        Enterprises</em> as authority that the law pertaining to trade marks
                    infringement was unique in that the final analysis was “more a matter of
                    feel than science”, <em>ie</em>, akin to a matter of
                    subjective assessment of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The effect of O 87 r 4(2) ROC was
                    also reviewed by Chan Seng Onn J in <em>Valentino</em>
                    (affirmed in Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2009). However, neither <em>Future Enterprises</em> nor <em>MediaCorp</em>
                    was referred to in <em>Valentino</em>. Chan J said at
                    [10] to [11]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    On O 55 which
                            governs appeals to the High Court from any court, tribunal or person,
                            para 55/1/2 of <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em>
                            notes that O 55 r 2(1) stipulates that the appeal is by way of
                            rehearing. Order 55, it suggests, confers upon the Court wider
                            powers than those so conferred under O 53 which deals with,
                                <em>inter alia</em>, judicial review. Hence,
                            O 55 r 6(5) provides that the appellate court can make any
                            order which should have been made by the tribunal. The appellate court
                            is thus not confined to merely determining whether the decision below
                            was compliant with rules of natural justice or reached honestly
                                (<em>Ling Uk Choon v Public Accountants
                                Board</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 517 at
                        [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    “By way of
                            rehearing” in my view means that the Court is not constrained to
                            determine only whether the tribunal’s decision was proper and/or
                            contained manifest errors of fact and law. If it wishes to, the Court in
                            its discretion may consider the entire ream of evidence before it and
                            venture beyond determining the propriety of the tribunal’s
                            decision or inquiring into whether there had been manifest errors of
                            fact or law. However, I do not think that it places an <em>irrevocable burden</em> upon the Courts to hear the
                            matter anew so that the substantive merits fall to be determined afresh.
                            As para 57/3/1 of <em>Singapore Civil
                                Procedure</em> observes with regard to the phrase “by
                            way of rehearing”, albeit in relation to appeals to the Court of
                            Appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">These words do not mean that the witnesses are heard afresh. They
                            indicate the appeal is not limited to a consideration whether the
                            misdirection, misperception of evidence or other alleged defect in the
                            trial has taken place, so that a new trial should be ordered. They
                            indicate that the court considers (so far as may be relevant) the whole
                            of the evidence given in the court below and the whole course of the
                            trial. [emphasis in italics in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The court’s power is therefore discretionary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Respondent therefore submitted that
                        <em>MediaCorp</em> and <em>Valentino</em> both represent the view that “rehearing”
                    in relation to an appellate review of a trade marks tribunal’s decision
                    under O 87 ROC takes reference from “rehearing” in an appeal
                    from the High Court to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As to the dichotomy between the finding of
                    facts and that of evaluation of facts, it was the Respondent’s submission
                    that regardless of whether a patents revocation proceeding paralleled a fact
                    finding exercise or one made on evaluation of facts, the appellate court in
                    exercising its discretion was still bound by <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> principles in considering whether new evidence should be
                    admitted at a late stage to be reviewed in totality with other evidence
                    presented before the tribunal or court below. In relation to the adduction of
                    evidence under O 87 r 4(3) ROC, the Respondent cited the following
                    passage at 1641 of the Singapore Court Practice 2009:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is an obligation on the parties to put forward all the evidence on
                        which they intend to rely before the Registrar, and failure to do this does
                        not normally result in indulgence by the court. The court’s task on an
                        appeal from the Registrar is to determine whether in all circumstances the
                        overriding objective was furthered by the admission of further evidence.
                        …
                        <em>the factors set out in the case of Ladd v Marshall [1954]
                            2 WLR 1489 are relevant to the exercise of the discretion to
                            admit further evidence</em>. (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Respondent submitted that this approach should be followed in
                    relation to adduction of further evidence under O 87A r 13(2)
                    ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Authorities from UK Trade Marks and Patents appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Respondent submitted that the approach
                    under O 87 r 4(2) ROC which imported the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> principles to the admissibility of fresh evidence in an
                    appeal from a trade marks tribunal to the High Court should equally apply to
                    that of an appeal from a patents tribunal to the High Court under O 87A
                    r 13(2) ROC. This approach is also supported by UK authorities which dealt
                    with trade marks and patents appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Allen &amp; Hanburys
                        Limited’s (Salbutamol) Patent</em> [1987] RPC 327
                        (“<em>Allen &amp; Hanburys case</em>”),
                    Dillon LJ at 374 held that an appeal to the Patents Court from the
                    Comptroller was “by way of a rehearing” pursuant to O 104
                    r 14(14) UK RSC which stated that no further evidence was to be given
                    except with the leave of court. This sub- rule appears to state the same
                    position as O 87A r 13(2) ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, the Respondent submitted that a
                    distinction ought to be drawn between O 104 r 14(14) UK RSC and
                    O 87A r 13(2) ROC as <em>Allen &amp; Hanburys
                        case</em> was decided against the backdrop of a statutory framework
                    whereby the Patents Court was empowered by O 104 r 14(18) UK RSC to
                    receive further evidence on questions of fact in such manner as the court may
                    direct and the Patents Court had the power to give any judgment or decision or
                    to make any order which ought to have been given or made by the Comptroller.
                    Hence, Dillon J’s holding at 376 that “the hearing in the
                    Patents Court was indeed a re-hearing and not merely a supervisory
                    exercise”. A parallel to O 104 r 14(18) UK RSC is notably
                    absent in O 87A ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The position stated in <em>Allen &amp; Hanburys case</em> may no longer be good law since the UK
                    Civil Procedure Rules 52PD 9.1 now provides that an appeal will not be a
                    re-hearing (as opposed to a review of the decision of the lower court) unless
                    required by any enactment or rule or unless the decision below was reached
                    without a hearing or without consideration of evidence, see <em>C.I.P.A Guide to the Patents Act</em> (6<sup>th</sup>
                    Edition) at [97.08].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Respondent also cited <em>Gebhardt’s Patent</em> [1992] RPC 1
                        (“<em>Gebhardt’s Patent case</em>”)
                    which involved an appeal against the Comptroller’s decision by the
                    proprietor of patent (relating to a roller train for the conveying and storage
                    of articles) to the Patents Court. This case confirmed the application of
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles to the adduction of
                    new evidence in an appeal to the Patents Court. Aldous J at 14 also held
                    that the alleged importance of new evidence in itself was not a sufficient
                    ground for its admission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     O 104 r 19(14) UK RSC (which the wording

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It was accepted in <em>Gebhardt’s Patent case</em> that the new evidence was available

                    the Patent Office. No reason was given why it was not. In refusing to admit
                    the new evidence that should have been filed before the hearing in the Patent
                    Office, Aldous J at 14 explained:</p>

                        to Order 14 proceedings. Proceedings before the Comptroller are similar
                        to proceedings before the Registrar of Trade Marks. On an appeal to the High
                        Court from a decision of the Registrar, new evidence can be admitted.
                        However, the general practice of the court on applications to admit new
                        evidence is the same as in the Court of Appeal, namely, to apply the
                        principles laid down in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954]
                        3 All ER 743 (see <em>Oxon Italia SPA’s Trade
                            Mark Application</em> [1981] FSR 408).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It was submitted that the application of
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles in <em>Gebhardt’s Patent case</em> was consistent with other
                    UK cases dealing with admission of fresh evidence in an appeal hearing before
                    the UK Patents Court (see <em>Imperial Chemical Industries v
                        Montedison (UK) Ltd &amp; Anor</em> [1995] RPC 449 at 467)
                    and in UK trade marks appeal proceedings (see <em>Etat Francaise
                        Representee par la Ministere de L’Agriculture de la Foret v Bernard
                        Matthews plc</em> [2002] EWHC 868).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Respondent further submitted that
                    Singapore cases on civil jurisprudence supported its position that <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles applied in the
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Court of Appeal in <em>WBG

                    clarified its earlier decision in <em>Lassiter Ann Masters v To
                        Keng Lam</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 392 (“<em>Lassiter’s case</em>”) which distinguished
                    between the standard to be applied in appeals where:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There were the characteristics of a full trial or
                            where oral evidence had been recorded (<em>eg</em>,
                            in proceedings of inquiries or in an assessment of damages);

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Court of Appeal in the <em>WBG case</em> at [8] recognised that, strictly speaking, <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> applied to appeals from the High Court
                    to the Court of Appeal and not to appeals from the Registrar to a judge in
                    chambers. However, the concern in <em>Lassiter’s
                        case</em> as raised by Chao Hick Tin JA was that a liberal use of
                    wide discretion by a judge in chambers to admit fresh evidence would defeat the
                    very rationale underlying the delegation of matters to the Registrar, <em>ie</em>, to help save judicial time. Such an objective would
                    be lost and could lead to abuse if either party was entitled to freely adduce
                    evidence for the judge at a later hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Furthermore, as Prakash J reasoned in
                        <em>Ang Leng Hock v Leo Ee Ah</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 361 at [15] (affirmed by <em>WBG
                        case</em> at [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that there is a distinction to be drawn between the adduction of
                        further evidence before the judge in chambers on an appeal from the
                        registrar against a decision on an interlocutory application like an
                        O 14 application, and one that is against a final decision, albeit by a
                        registrar, which has been taken after a full trial on the merits in that
                        discovery has taken place, documents and affidavits of evidence-in-chief
                        have been filed, <em>viva voce</em> evidence has been
                        given and the parties have had the opportunity of cross-examining each
                        other’s witnesses. In the first case the original evidence would have
                        been only documentary. Any prejudice that might have arisen from allowing
                        further documentary evidence by way of affidavit could have been dealt with
                        easily by giving the other party a right of reply. The second situation is
                        very different. In that case, both parties would have (or should have)
                        prepared for the hearing before the registrar in the same manner as for a
                        trial in the High Court and would have engaged in the discovery exercise and
                        in the cross-examination of witnesses. To allow further evidence to be
                        freely adduced before the judge on appeal could easily lead to abuse of
                        process…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It was submitted that <em>Lassiter’s case</em> at [24] - [26] held that the strict
                    applicability of the second and third conditions of <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> principles was confined to cases where the first
                    instance proceedings contained the hallmarks of a full trial. In contrast, a
                    more liberal judicial discretion for admission of new evidence exists in
                    interlocutory appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In this respect, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>WBG case</em> at [14] took the view that a party
                    wishing to adduce further evidence before the judge in chambers in cases where
                    the hearing at first instance did not possess the characteristics of a trial
                    might still have to persuade the judge that he had overcome all three
                    requirements of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> because the judge
                    was entitled, <em>though not obliged</em>, to employ the
                    conditions therein in deciding whether to exercise her discretion to admit or
                    reject the further evidence. Hence, in cases where the first instance
                    proceedings did not bear the traits of a full trial, the question of whether
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles applied to the
                    facts of the case and the extent of application thereof would essentially be
                    left to the court hearing the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Respondent submitted that the present case
                    had been dealt with in a quasi-trial manner as statements and evidence were
                    exchanged and the respective parties’ witnesses were examined and
                    cross-examined before the Tribunal. Thus, the second and third conditions of
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> should strictly apply even if
                    the Appeal was taken to be a hearing <em>de
                    novo</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was the Respondent’s submission that
                    the Applicant failed in satisfying (in particular) the second and third
                    conditions of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> as:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There were ample opportunities in which the
                            Applicant could have conducted the experiment in D4a as it was raised in
                            the Respondent’s Notice of Revocation dated 20 January 2006 and
                            had been made available to the Applicant for the last four years to
                            conduct any experiments set out in D4a and submit any evidence therein
                            to the Tribunal during the revocation proceedings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The alleged fresh evidence would be of little, if
                            any, value given that the Tribunal had decided that the
                            Applicant’s claims were invalid in view of prior art other than
                            that of D4a;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Applicant had not shown the credibility of
                            the alleged fresh evidence as the Applicant had not provided any basis
                            in the application for the Respondent’s technical experts to
                            verify that the steps and/or procedures to be undertaken in the repeat
                            experiment would be in accordance with the steps and/or procedures set
                            out in D4a.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Respondent also advanced the following
                    factors (apart from the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    principles), which were enumerated in <em>Wunderkind Trade
                        Mark</em> [2002] RPC 45 at 937 (approved by <em>DU PONT Trade Mark</em> [2004] FSR 15 at [103]), in assisting
                    this court in determining whether it should exercise its discretion in relation
                    to the adduction of fresh evidence in the Appeal:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether or not the Respondent will be

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of Appeal under O 87A r 13(2) ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The fact that a patents revocation appeal
                    under O87A ROC is made from a Tribunal does not necessarily warrant the
                    conclusion that it is identical or analogous to an appeal made under O 55
                    ROC. A plain reading of the wording of O 87A ROC which stipulated that
                    “except with the leave of the Court, no further evidence shall be
                    given” suggests that the judge’s discretion under O 87A
                    r 13(2) ROC is not as wide as its counterpart under O 55 r 6(2)
                    ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Insofar as O 87 ROC provides assistance
                    in the determination of the nature of an appeal under O 87A ROC, it was
                    noted at 1655 of the Supreme Court Practice 2009 that the approach under
                    O 87 ROC concerning trade marks whereby “rehearing” is
                        <em>not</em> to be understood as referring to a full
                        <em>de novo</em> rehearing of evidence and that the
                    court merely reviews the decision under appeal under its supervisory
                    jurisdiction should be adopted when deciding under O 87A ROC. This supports
                    the analysis in <em>MediaCorp</em> and <em>Valentino</em> that a “rehearing” under O 87
                    r 4 ROC is similar to that under O 57 r 13 ROC (<em>ie</em>, an appeal from High Court to the Court of
                    Appeal).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Further, it is also important to note that the
                    hearing before the Tribunal differed from normal interlocutory applications
                    before a Registrar of the Supreme Court. The proceedings before the Tribunal
                    were akin to a full trial with oral evidence having been adduced and
                    cross-examination having taken place. <em>Lassiter’s
                        case</em> which was an appeal against a Registrar’s assessment
                    of damages would therefore provide a better analogy to the application as
                    opposed to one of an interlocutory nature. The statutory framework of the
                    Patents Act read with O 87A ROC suggests that the Tribunal is the proper
                    forum for the taking of evidence and that the High Court sitting in its
                    appellate capacity does not have unbridled powers to introduce fresh evidence
                    after a decision has been rendered by the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Hence, by contrasting the language employed by
                    different rules concerning adduction of further evidence under ROC and taking
                    into account the characteristics of a hearing before the Tribunal, it could be
                    seen that the nature of an appeal under O 87A r 13(2) ROC is akin to
                    that from the High Court to the Court of Appeal under O 57 ROC. Notably,
                    this forms a coherent and parallel framework to the adduction of evidence in the
                    context of trade marks appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The authorities which were cited by the
                    Applicant in support of its position that the principles in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> did not apply to the present application did not
                    purport to detract from <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>.
                    Laddie J’s judgment in <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s
                        case</em> as quoted in the Applicant’s submissions should be
                    given adequate scrutiny in order to fully appreciate the reasoning therein. At
                    241, Laddie J opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he hearing before the High Court is a rehearing. In my view the more
                        appropriate course to adopt now is to look at all the circumstances,
                            <em>including those factors set out in</em> Ladd v
                        Marshall and to decide whether on the particular facts the undoubted power
                        of the court to admit fresh evidence should be exercised in favour of doing
                        so. (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Laddie J therefore did not decide that the principles in
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> were irrelevant in the context
                    of adduction of further evidence in a trade marks appeal. It is clear that
                    Laddie J contemplated that <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    factors were to be taken into account, albeit to be considered with/against
                    other factors as stated in <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s
                        case</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Pumfrey J in <em>Wunderkind Trade Mark</em> [2002] RPC 45 at [57] held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no doubt that in a trade mark appeal other factors outside the
                            <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> criteria may well be
                        relevant. Thus in my judgment it is legitimate to take into account such
                        factors as those enumerated by Laddie J in <em>Hunt
                            Wesson</em>, <em>provided always that it is
                            remembered that the factors set out in</em> Ladd v Marshall
                            <em>are basic to the exercise of the discretion to admit
                            fresh evidence and that those factors have peculiar weight when
                            considering whether or not the overriding objective [ie, of dealing with
                            individual cases justly] is to be furthered</em>. (emphasis
                        added)</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The cases cited by the parties appear to me to
                    be merely variations or different formulations of what essentially were the
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles. For instance,
                    Jeffery Pinsler SC in Singapore Court Practice 2009 noted at 1641 that some of
                    the eight factors expounded by Laddie J in the “somewhat relaxed
                    approach” in <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s case</em>
                    were similar to those in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> while
                    others were of particular relevance to trade marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Moreover, Aldous J’s observation in
                    respect of O 104 r 19(14) UK RSC in <em>Gebhardt’s Patents case</em> that the practice of the UK court
                    has been to refuse to admit new evidence, save in exceptional cases, unless the
                    new evidence was not in the possession of the party seeking to introduce it and
                    that such party could not with reasonable diligence have obtained the evidence
                    for use at the hearing in the Patent Office, was also a variation of the first
                    condition of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>. Essentially, the
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> principles are “simple
                    and sensible directions” (in <em>WBG case</em> [15])
                    which revolve around one enquiry that goes towards the justice of the case: why
                    did the applicant not adduce the evidence before the Tribunal given its alleged
                    importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As the Court of Appeal in <em>WBG case</em> at [11] noted, the position in <em>Lassiter’s case</em> should not be construed as any form of
                    unqualified endorsement of any rule that the second and third conditions of
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> must necessarily apply in all
                    circumstances, whether they be appeals from an assessment of damages before the
                    Registrar or in respect of interlocutory applications. Given that the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>WBG case</em> at [14] also envisaged that
                    even in cases where the first instance proceedings did not manifest the
                    characteristics of a trial, the applicant in an application to adduce further
                    evidence might still have to persuade the judge that he had overcome all three
                    requirements of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>, I am of the view
                    that <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> should apply where leave is
                    sought to adduce further evidence, albeit with appropriate modifications if the
                    nature of the appeal and the factual matrix of the case so
                require.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The experiment in D4 ought to have been done
                    before the hearing or applied for during the hearing or, at the very least,
                    between the close of hearing and the decision by the Tribunal (a period of some
                    8 months). The Applicant’s position that the necessity of conducting the
                    experiment only arose during cross-examination did not explain why the
                    application to adduce fresh evidence should only take place at the appeal stage.
                    The Applicant’s inaction over the period between 12 February 2009 to
                    3 November 2009 shows a lack of due diligence in securing all relevant
                    evidence before the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     After the hearing of the application before
                    me, counsel for the Applicant, by way of a letter dated 19 March 2010
                    requesting further arguments pursuant to s 34(1)(c) SCJA, informed me that
                    “After the date of the hearing, we learned that the Applicant had already
                    conducted a repeat of Example 1 in D4 (as referred to in the application) and
                    had obtained the results referred to below”. This was surprising as the
                    application had proceeded on the basis that the Applicant <em>wanted to conduct the experiment</em> and place the results before
                    the appellate court. If the experiment had been conducted prior to the hearing
                    of the application, the question immediately arises as to why the Applicant did
                    not file any affidavit relating to the experiment and its outcome to support its
                    application to adduce the fresh evidence. This was despite the Respondent having
                    filed an affidavit to oppose the application, alleging that the Applicant had
                    not explained how and in what manner the fresh evidence would be relevant or
                    have an important influence on the outcome of the appeal (see [4] of the affidavit of Kristian J Robinson
                    filed on 1 February 2010). The Applicant’s failure to properly
                    instruct its counsel about having conducted the experiment before the
                    application places it in poor light when the court decides whether or not to
                    exercise its discretion to admit the fresh evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It was submitted (in the request for further
                    arguments) that the result of the experiment conducted by the Applicant was
                    crucial and highly relevant to the Appeal as the Applicant’s findings
                    revealed that the oil produced by following Example 1 in D4 did not meet the
                    requirement of claim 1 of the Patent, <em>ie</em>, that the
                    oil must comprise at least 50% arachidonic acid. This would cast doubt on the
                    accuracy of the results in Table 1 of D4 which stated that 72.9% arachidonic
                    acid could be produced. The court was therefore urged not to accept the results
                    stated in D4 at face value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In its response by letter dated 29 March
                    2010, the Respondent objected to the request for further arguments. The
                    Respondent criticised the Appellant’s failure and/or neglect to instruct
                    its counsel about the alleged experiment and asked why, if it was so important,
                    the Applicant did not produce it at the hearing of its application. The
                    Respondent further submitted that the alleged experiment would not have any
                    major or influential bearing upon the Appeal. This was because even if there was
                    an inaccuracy in D4, the Tribunal’s decision was that the Patent was also
                    invalid in view of prior art <em>other than</em> D4. As
                    illustrated by the Respondent:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Applicant alleged that the Tribunal erred in
                            finding that claims 3, 26 and 36 were not novel and inventive over D1,
                            D2 and D4a. The Tribunal’s grounds of decision at [152] clearly
                            showed that even if D4a was not considered, the features of claims 3, 26
                            and 36 that cells of <em>Mortierella alpina</em>
                            produce arachidonic acid but not EPA when incubated at 25 ºC was
                            disclosed in D1 and D2;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">[156] of the grounds of decision showed that even
                            if D4a was not considered, the feature claims 4, 27 and 37 that the oil
                            was obtainable by submerged fermentation of <em>Mortierella alpina</em> was disclosed in D7;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Applicant’s claim 24 which disclosed
                            the feature of use of hexane as the non-polar solvent was anticipated by
                            both D4a and D7. Hence, in any event, claim 24 would be anticipated by
                            the disclosure in D7;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Similarly, claim 2 lacked novelty in view of D7
                            alone whereas claims 1 to 19 and 35 to 44 lacked inventive step in view
                            of any one of prior arts D1, D2, D6 or D7. Even if D4a was not
                            considered, the claims 1 to 19 and 35 to 44 would lack inventiveness in
                            view of the aforementioned prior art references.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Moreover, without enclosing any report or result of the alleged
                    experiment, the Respondent’s experts would be in no position to verify the
                    credibility of the alleged result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I agreed with the Respondent and did not
                    accede to the request for further arguments. Apart from causing undue delay to
                    the Appeal proceedings, granting leave to adduce the fresh evidence would entail
                    a re-opening of the revocation hearing and further taking of evidence by a judge
                    of the High Court. This would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme in which
                    the taking of evidence is within the purview of the Tribunal. If I were to
                    direct that the Tribunal to conduct the further hearing in respect of the fresh
                    evidence, the status of the Patent would be in limbo again. All this would be
                    unjustifiable in the light of the Applicant’s conduct relating to this
                    application (see <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     For the foregoing reasons, the application in
                    Summons No 234 of 2010 was dismissed with costs of $5,500 (inclusive of
                    disbursements) to be paid by the Applicant to the Respondents as costs of this
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Applicant has appealed to the Court of
                    Appeal against my decision.</p>
