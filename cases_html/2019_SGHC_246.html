The second accused (“Reduan”) and the third accused (“Nazeeha”), who is Reduan’s girlfriend, are Singaporeans. On 23 September 2016, Tan delivered a purple bag (“the Paper Bag”) containing one Daia washing powder box (“the Daia Box”) to Nazeeha at Lorong 26 Geylang, and Nazeeha brought it back to Reduan’s flat at Rezi 26 (“the Flat”). Reduan had asked Nazeeha to collect the item from Tan. The Daia Box was subsequently found to contain, among other things, a packet containing not less than 978.3 grams of crystalline substance, analysed and found to contain not less than 661.2 grams of methamphetamine (“the Drugs”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Tan, Reduan and Nazeeha were tried jointly.

Nazeeha’s plea was re-taken and she nevertheless elected to claim trial. Parties stated that there was no need to recall witnesses or take further evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against Tan, Reduan and Nazeeha, and I convicted them on their respective charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I found that Tan’s role in the offence was restricted to that of a courier and that he was suffering from abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility within the meaning of s 33B(3) of the MDA, and I imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Reduan did not qualify for the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA and I thus imposed the mandatory death sentence on him.

At about 6.05pm on 23 September 2016, Tan was spotted riding a motorcycle into Geylang Lorong 26 and turning into a small lane next to Rezi 26. A while later, Nazeeha was observed exiting the side gate of Rezi 26 and towards Geylang Lorong 26, and subsequently turning back and walking towards the small lane that Tan had turned into earlier.

After a few deliveries, Tan began to suspect that the money might be from illegal activities as he had seen that “the amount was big” and that the money was in a “big bundle” when Ahmad opened the plastic bag containing the money in front of him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 23 September 2016 at about 3.45pm, Ahmad called Tan to collect a plastic bag containing a box of detergent powder from a male Indian, just after the crossing at Woodlands Checkpoint, and to hand it to Reduan. Although Ahmad told Tan that it was “nothing dangerous”, Tan was reluctant to help Ahmad as he thought the delivery must be “for something illegal”. Nevertheless, he agreed to do so as he owed Reduan a favour for having helped him pay off some rental arrears, and Ahmad had informed him that if he did not assist with the delivery he would not get $200 which he was supposed to receive for helping Ahmad deliver some money earlier that day.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) After crossing Woodlands Checkpoint, Tan picked up a blue plastic bag with the Daia Box from an Indian man and brought it home but left it outside his flat. He then called Reduan and told him that he would reach his place at about 6.00pm and if Reduan did not come and collect the Daia Box, he would leave it by the roadside. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Tan removed the Daia Box from the blue plastic bag and placed it into the Paper Bag and rode to Geylang Lorong 26. When he arrived, he called Reduan and Reduan told him that Nazeeha would collect the Daia Box from him. Tan left the Paper Bag with the Daia Box near some flower pots as he was “feeling very scared” and thought that if the Daia Box really contained “Bai Fen”, an illegal drug which may carry the death penalty in Singapore, he would not see his wife again. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Shortly after, Nazeeha appeared and handed Tan the Envelope. She told him that it contained $200 for his “kopi money” and another $750 for the Indian man from whom he had collected the Daia Box. Nazeeha told him to hand the $750 to Ahmad.

Subsequently Tan made a few more deliveries for L, for a cash reward.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In July 2016, Reduan asked Tan for help again, and told Tan that he was working with Ahmad on drug activities. On that occasion, Tan had borrowed $1,200 from Reduan. Reduan told him that after he assisted Reduan to deliver money to Johor Bahru each time, Reduan would deduct his reward of $200 to repay the loan. Reduan also told him that he and Ahmad were dealing in small quantities of “Sejuk” (or “bing”). Tan then started delivering money for Ahmad and Reduan in the last week of July. Reduan also asked Tan if he could assist to collect “bing” for him on a subsequent occasion, for which he would be paid $800. Tan agreed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In early August 2016, Reduan asked Tan to collect drugs in Singapore in addition to delivering money. Tan agreed as he wanted to repay the loan to Reduan. At Ahmad’s instructions, he met up with one “Boy Ask” who handed him a bag of coffee powder and told him there was Sejuk (“bing”) inside. Tan delivered the coffee powder to Reduan who told Tan that Tan did not owe him any more money.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In the last week of August 2016, he helped to deliver money, but did not collect any cash reward of $200 from Reduan as he had ordered some “bing” from Reduan for the same price. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) On 23 September 2016, when Ahmad asked him to collect the Daia Box, he was reluctant to do so as first, as he believed that it contained “bing”.

</div>, Reduan received a call from Tan, whilst he and Nazeeha were in bed. Reduan told Nazeeha that Tan had called to send groceries, asked her to collect them and at the same time to take the Envelope from his car to pass to Tan. Reduan did not tell her what the Envelope contained. Nazeeha took the Envelope and went to look for Tan. When she saw him, she passed him the Envelope and only said “nah” to him. Tan then pointed to the Paper Bag on the ground near his motorcycle and told her “Nah, this is the barang-barang”, mumbled something that she did not understand, and then rode off. After stopping to smoke a cigarette, she returned to the Flat with the Paper Bag (which she saw contained the Daia Box), put it on the chair in the living room and went back to bed. Shortly after, CNB raided the Flat. When Tan told her it was “barang barang”, she understood it to mean groceries though she accepted that a literal English translation would be “stuff” or “things”.

</div> The bottom line was that he did not attempt to dispel his suspicious at all, and in any event, he admitted that he was not even purchasing groceries for Reduan on that occasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Third, Tan’s conduct after he took the Daia Box was telling. He refrained from bringing the Daia Box into his flat as he was “scared” because he knew it contained something illegal. When he arrived at Geylang Lorong 26, he called Reduan and told him to “quickly come” and collect the Daia Box; and he decided that if Reduan did not collect it soon, he would leave it by the roadside so that it would not “attract attention easily”. He was clearly in a hurry to leave the Daia Box behind. Tan said that he was very scared because if the Daia Box contained drugs, he would not be able to see his wife again. He then left the Paper Bag with the Daia Box next to some flower pots to disassociate himself from these, instead of waiting to hand them directly to Reduan or Nazeeha. While these alone may not necessarily show that Tan had knowledge that the Daia Box contained methamphetamine, his conduct must be considered in totality with the rest of the evidence above. In particular, it disproved his claim that he did not believe Ahmad when Ahmad told him the Daia Box contained “bing”. Indeed, in court, Tan agreed that at the material time, he strongly suspected that the Daia Box contained methamphetamine and that was why he left it outside his flat and then by the roadside when he arrived at Geylang Lorong 26.

</div> For starters, Tan did not even rely on this reason as his defence. Even if he were suffering from major depressive disorder and was lowly educated, this did not therefore mean that he was unaware of what he was carrying at the material time, or that his claim that he thought he was carrying washing powder should be believed. I reiterate that Tan had claimed to have had previous dealings with Reduan and/or Ahmad in relation to drugs. In Tan’s 5th Statement, he claimed to have helped deliver drugs, and related Reduan’s offer to him in August 2016 to transport drugs. Reduan had also supplied him with methamphetamine to consume

Tan’s suspicion and deliberate refusal to inquire were evidence which, against the backdrop of all the other evidence, sustained a factual inference that he had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (<span class="font-italic">Adili </span>at [45]), in this case methamphetamine. Moreover, Tan’s possession of the Daia Box (containing the Drugs) was for the purposes of trafficking – he admitted he intended to deliver it to Reduan and had passed the Daia Box to Nazeeha – and without authorisation. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the elements of the charge against Tan had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted him on the charge. Even on an alternative analysis relying on the ss 18(1) and 18(2) presumptions, for the same reasons stated above, I would not have found Tan to have rebutted the presumptions on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings on Reduan </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Reduan stated that he instructed Nazeeha to collect “sabun cuci baju” on 23 September 2016 from Tan.

Some 10 minutes before Reduan sent the Message, he had sent another message to Ijai asking “how many to standby” “because many order”, whereupon Ijai replied to ask for “500”. Indeed, after sending the Message stating “the most I can kick 250”, he sent Ijai another message to explain “because one stick is another customer’s”. I agreed with the Prosecution that, reading the messages together, Reduan was unable to supply more than 250g of methamphetamine not due to any policy about dealing beyond a particular weight, but due to him having more than one order.

</div> Indeed, Reduan’s explanation to Ijai why he could only supply 250g of methamphetamine to Ijai “because one stick is another customer’s” would suggest that Reduan was dealing with more than 250g of methamphetamine at the same time. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even though Reduan’s policy (as he claimed) was not to have at any one time more than 250g of methamphetamine and thus not to sell an amount exceeding 250g, Ijai had asked Reduan for 500g. I rejected Reduan’s explanation that Ijai had asked him for 500g of methamphetamine because Ijai saw Tan pass to Reduan a pack (which contained 250g of methamphetamine) and Tan had another “stick” in his motorcycle. As Reduan admitted, Ijai would not have known whether the “stick” contained drugs let alone the amount, and there was no evidence that Ijai knew the quantity of drugs in the pack that Tan had passed to Reduan. Further, if Reduan’s policy was that he would not deal with more than 250g of methamphetamine at a time, it was strange that his reply to Ijai (when Ijai asked for 500g) was that he could only “kick 250” because “one stick is another customer’s” when it would have been more logical to inform Ijai of his policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Additionally, on 14 July 2016, Reduan sent Nazeeha a message stating:

</div> Even assuming that the above message was sent whilst Reduan and Nazeeha were in a quarrel, as Mr Masih suggested, I disbelieved Reduan because there was no link between the text of the message and his purported attempt to seek Nazeeha’s attention. Nothing in the message suggested that Reduan was persuading or pleading with Nazeeha regarding their baby. When asked how a message like that would have persuaded Nazeeha not to abort their baby, he could not give a satisfactory explanation, and merely claimed that what he told her (that he was going to take 1kg from Tan) was something that “came to [him] out of a sudden”.

Reduan’s 18 September message was sent by him <span class="font-italic">to Nazeeha</span>. There was no reason why Reduan would discuss Mambo’s customers with her. Pertinently Reduan’s 18 September message was preceded by a message from Nazeeha to Reduan (just two minutes before) asking about “sales” and another message (about 30 minutes before) stating “I just need the sales update”. In my view, reading the messages in context, Nazeeha was asking Reduan for an update of <span class="font-italic">his</span> sales of drugs.

Then, in his final statement (Reduan’s 9th Statement) he stated the Drugs belonged to Ahmad who told him to hold onto it for someone to collect, and at the material time, he did not know the amount of “ice” in the Daia Box.

In Reduan’s 9th Statement, he claimed he lied and did not mention Ahmad because if the CNB could not arrest Ahmad, he would “be dead”.

He initially made up a story about an Indian man in his earlier statements. He also claimed he had no idea what the remaining $750 in the Envelope was for, but later admitted that Nazeeha had informed him that Reduan was deducting $50 from him.

On the contrary, in Nazeeha’s 3rd Statement, she asserted that she had asked Tan where the bag was. However, in court she first denied she had mentioned this to ASP Prashant, then claimed that she could not recall how the conversation between her and Tan went but there “[wasn’t] much conversation”, before finally claiming that she could not recall specifically what the conversation was (when it was put to her that saying “nah” was an afterthought and untrue).

Even before 23 September 2016, Nazeeha already knew that Reduan was involved in drug activities. She admitted that the delivery of the “barang-barang” on 23 September 2016 was unusual, especially given that she had not ordered anything. Her reason for not verifying the contents of the Daia Box because Tan was a bubbly and jovial person whom she would not have suspected was involved in any drug, was unconvincing. The handphone messages between Reduan and her also showed that she wanted to assist him in his drug activities, to the extent of her actively prompting him for sales updates. I also found that she had seen the Words on the Envelope and known of its contents, and I accepted Tan’s account that Nazeeha had told him about some money in it being his “kopi money” – Reduan himself confirmed he had told Nazeeha there was money in the Envelope. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the elements of the charge against Nazeeha had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted her on the charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence in relation to Tan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Given the quantity of drugs in relation to the charge against Tan, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death.

I had rejected his defence that he was merely holding the drugs for Ahmad’s customer – Ahmad’s evidence was unhelpful and did not support Reduan’s case in any event. There was no evidence that what Reduan did was restricted to transporting, sending or delivering of the Drugs, or offering to do any of the aforementioned, within the definition of “courier” under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). His act of instructing Nazeeha to collect the Drugs from Tan was also not an act that was “preparatory to or for the purpose of” transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug – which must be limited to facilitative and incidental acts (see <span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] SGCA 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainudin</span>”) at [91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I was cognisant that the court should look only to Reduan’s role in respect of the charge for which he was tried (and in relation to the consignment of drugs which form the subject of the charge), in determining whether he was a courier. Nevertheless, as the Court stated in <span class="font-italic">Zainudin</span> (at [109]), it is imperative that the accused furnishes an explanation for his conduct if he is seeking to persuade the court that he is a mere courier, given that s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) puts the burden on him to prove that he is a courier. Apart from his assertion that he was merely holding the Drugs for Ahmad’s customers (which I disbelieved), Reduan had not shown me what he had intended to do with the Drugs, which were of a very large quantity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In any event, as the Prosecution did not issue Reduan with a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA, Reduan could not avail himself of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B.

Nazeeha had also assisted Reduan in his trafficking activities, including weighing drugs and keeping track of his sales records. As Nazeeha was financially dependent on Reduan and his drug trafficking business in particular, she benefitted financially from her assistance in his drug trafficking activities. Hence she was of low to medium culpability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Mr Dhillon submitted that a sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate. Nazeeha was not recruited by Reduan in his illegal drug enterprise and she did not receive any monetary benefit for her role. She also did not transport the Drugs in a sophisticated manner to avoid detection, and had cooperated in the investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">Adri Anton Kalangi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 2 SLR 557 at [80] (“<span class="font-italic">Adri</span>”), the Court of Appeal held that the indicative starting sentence for trafficking in 217g to 250g of methamphetamine would be between 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. In <span class="font-italic">Adri</span>, the Court upheld the sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, where the accused had pleaded guilty to a charge of importing not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine. In <span class="font-italic">Pham Duyen Quyen</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 571, the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment, where the accused had claimed trial to a charge of importing not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine (the charge having been reduced to a non-capital offence).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I noted that Nazeeha had no antecedents. However, the quantity of methamphetamine in the amended charge was large, initially being capital in nature but subsequently reduced to just below the capital threshold. Further, apart from the fact that Nazeeha has no relevant antecedents and that she is young, there were no real mitigating factors such as a plea of guilt. Whilst there was no evidence that she had been “recruited” by Reduan in his drug trafficking activities, she had nevertheless assisted him willingly.
