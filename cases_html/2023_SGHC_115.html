Further, since the Claimant is not relying on a presumption of resulting trust, there is no scope for the operation of any presumption of advancement (by virtue of the Defendant being the Deceased’s wife at the material time) in the Defendant’s favour to negate the finding of a trust.

It was not disputed that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun had made unequal contributions to the joint accounts. Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he then was) held that the operation of the right of survivorship turned on the following successive stages of analysis. First, citing the judgment of Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Collars Muriel Esther de Jesus v Sandra Audrey Jude Collars </span>[2008] SGHC 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Collars Muriel Esther</span>”, at [30]), Ang JC noted that the onus would be on the person challenging the right of survivorship to demonstrate a contrary intention (at [53]-[54] of <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>). Where such a contrary intention could be shown, the rule of survivorship could be displaced by a resulting trust or a presumed resulting trust. The former would arise where there was evidence of a clear intention on the part of the deceased to retain beneficial ownership, whereas the latter would operate where there had been a transfer of property to the survivor for which the survivor had not provided the whole of the consideration (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> at </span>[35]), and there was no evidence before the court which “adequately reveals the true intention of the transferor” (<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel</span>”) at [79]). Where the presumption of resulting trust arose, the burden of proof would shift such that the deceased was presumed to have intended to retain the beneficial ownership of the property (at [55] of <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>). Ang JC further noted (at [57] of <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>) that the CA in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>had made it clear that the presumption of resulting trust “should not be applied mechanically”, and that the strength of the presumption would vary depending on the particular circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Next, Ang JC pointed out that the presumption of resulting trust, being a rebuttable presumption, was capable of being rebutted in cases where the presumption of advancement operated such that the deceased transferor was regarded as having made a gift to the transferee with no intention to retain an interest in the property concerned. The presumption of advancement would be “only relevant where a presumed resulting trust has already been found on the facts”; and if applicable, it “shifts the burden of proof back to the party who challenges the transfer to the surviving recipient” (at [58] of <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In respect of the application of the presumption of advancement, Ang JC also highlighted the CA’s view in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>(at [77]) that as with the presumption of resulting trust, so too the strength of the presumption of advancement would vary according to the individual circumstances of each case. This “would allow a court to more accurately give effect to the parties’ intentions”. In this connection, the court would consider two key elements in its inquiry: first, the nature of the relationship between the parties, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the obligation that one party has to the other; and second, the state of the relationship, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the parties were in a close or distant relationship (<span class="font-italic">per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew </span><span class="font-italic">Kim</span> at [78]). Based on the weight of the evidence, the court would determine if the presumption of advancement had been successfully rebutted. If the challenging party manages to defeat the presumption of advancement, then the original presumption of resulting trust would operate; and conversely, if they failed, then the presumption of advancement would displace the presumption of resulting trust such that the right of survivorship would take effect (at [64] of <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni and another v Tay Yuan Wei </span><span class="font-italic">Jaycie (formerly known as Tay Yeng Choo Jessy) and another </span>[2020] SGCA 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>”), the CA noted that the presumption of advancement operates in certain circumstances to rebut the presumed resulting trust – <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in the context of certain recognised categories of relationships such as parent-child relationships. Such recognised categories of relationships included transfers from husband to wife (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [60]). The CA in <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span> reiterated that the strength of the presumption would vary based on the prevailing circumstances of the case, with key elements in the inquiry including, in particular, the nature and state of the relationship between the parties (at [5] of <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>). In <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>, the dispute concerned the beneficial ownership of a HDB flat originally purchased by the appellants, a married couple. Some 12 years later, the appellants added their son (the second respondent) and his then wife (the first respondent) as legal co-owners. The issue that arose on appeal before the CA was whether the presumption of advancement arising in favour of the second respondent had been rebutted. The CA held that it had. In the CA’s view, it was significant that the appellants’ financial circumstances at the time of the transfer were such that they could not conceivably have intended to make a gift of a substantial part of what was in truth their principal asset. The CA found, moreover, that the evidence revealed that the respondents were added as legal co-owners to enable them to use their Central Provident Fund monies to help pay down part of the mortgage in light of the appellants’ dire financial straits (at [9] of <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In applying the analytical approach set out by Ang JC in <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>, it is also important to bear in mind the CA’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”, at [52]) that “the question in every case where the claim is based on the existence of a resulting trust is still whether there is any direct <span class="font-italic">evidence that may adequately reveal the intention of the transferor</span>”. The CA in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> endorsed the reasoning of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Yeow Kelvin</span>”). In that case, the High Court found that there was no necessity to make use of presumptions such as the presumption of resulting trust because it was satisfied on the basis of the evidence before it that the deceased (one “Bee Bee”) had intended to give the monies in the joint bank account to the defendant. In so finding, the court observed at [116] (and its observations were cited with approval by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… If the court could discern a clear intention on the part of the deceased to gift all the moneys in the joint account to the survivor from the evidence before it, then there should be no need to apply any presumption of a resulting trust to aid the fact-finding or decision-making process. Only when the court is not able to find any clear intention or if the evidence is inconclusive either way as to what the deceased’s real intention might be, then in this rather limited and exceptional situation (where the evidence is so finely balanced on either side) should the court apply the evidential presumption of a resulting trust to tilt the balance in favour of the estate of the deceased (who solely contributed the moneys in joint account).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As an illustration of how the courts analyse the evidence adduced to ascertain if it discloses a clear intention on the deceased’s part to gift (or not to gift) the jointly held property, it is helpful to examine the decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court (“AD”) in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin (as the sole executrix of the estate of Lim Guan Heong, deceased) v Lim Sai Ing Peggy </span>[2022] 1 SLR 873 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>”). In that case, the respondent was one of several children of the late Mr Lim Guan Heong (“Mr Lim”). A dispute arose over the ownership of a HDB flat in Jalan Batu. Mr Lim had originally been the sole registered proprietor of the flat, but he had added the respondent as a joint tenant in 1981 (“the 1981 Transfer”). Mr Lim passed away in 2015. The appellant, who was also one of Mr Lim’s children, brought an application in her capacity as the sole executrix of his estate for a declaration that the respondent held the flat on trust for Mr Lim’s estate. The High Court rejected the appellant’s application at first instance on the ground that the documentary evidence unequivocally showed Mr Lim’s intention to confer his beneficial interest in the flat on himself and the respondent as joint tenants by way of <span class="font-italic">inter</span><span class="font-italic"> vivos </span>gift. The High Court relied in particular on a stamp in the title deed which stated that the flat had been transferred to Mr Lim and to the respondent by way of gift, as joint tenants. Additionally, the transfer instrument stated that the 1981 Transfer had taken place in consideration of “natural love and affection”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The High Court’s decision was reversed by the Appellate Division of the High Court (“AD”) on appeal. In allowing the appeal, the AD pointed out that though the title deed and the transfer instrument were contemporaneous records, they “could hardly be said to be conclusive of Mr Lim’s actual intent and state of mind as at the time when the 1981 Transfer was effected” (at [11] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>). Noting that the importance of considering the circumstantial evidence on hand in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span> was reinforced by the lack of any evidence from the late Mr Lim about his intentions, the AD found that the weight of the evidence as a whole did not support the respondent’s contention that the 1981 Transfer had been intended as a gift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As the Claimant in the present case seeks to rely heavily on <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>, it is important to examine the reasons why the AD in that case found that the evidence before it did not support the contention that the transfer of the flat was intended as a gift. First (at [14]-[15]), the AD noted that Mr Lim was illiterate in English and had signed in Chinese on the transfer documents. There was also no evidence that he had been advised on the legal implications of the 1981 Transfer or that he had even read or understood the words “By Gift” on the title deed stamp. The AD contrasted those facts with the facts of <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Saw Ching v Yam Hui Min, Barbara Rebecca </span>[2014] SGHC 212 (“<span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Saw Ching</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Saw Ching</span>, the applicant also executed a transfer of a HDB flat to the respondent as joint tenant with the applicant herself. The consideration for the transfer was also stated in the transfer document to be “Natural Love and Affection”, with the transfer being described as a “Gift” on the HDB lease. In finding that the applicant had intended the transfer as a gift and not as a trust as she subsequently claimed, the High Court placed weight on the fact that both the procedure for and the effect of the transfer had been clearly explained to the applicant before she executed the transfer; and further, that the applicant had not challenged the respondent’s evidence that the words “Natural Love and Affection” had been stated as the consideration at her (the applicant’s) direction (at [37] of <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Saw Ching</span>).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, the AD in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>(at [16])<span class="font-italic"> </span>found that even after the 1981 Transfer, Mr Lim continued to exercise control over the flat as if he were its sole owner: <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by adding the appellant as a joint tenant as well in 2001 without first obtaining the respondent’s consent (though the appellant herself removed her name from the flat of her own accord in 2003); and by demanding the payment of rental from those of his children who resided in the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Third, the AD (at [18]-[19] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>) found that there was no evidence of a particularly close relationship between the respondent and Mr Lim. On the contrary, the evidence showed that Mr Lim was a “traditional patriarch who favoured his only son”. In this connection, the AD found it pertinent that the evidence showed Mr Lim had added only the respondent’s name in 1981 because she was the only one out of his eight children who was suitable to become an owner of the flat at that time; and that he had added her name only as a matter of administrative convenience and/or because he feared that since he (the then owner) did not stay at the flat himself after 1981, there was a risk of it being repossessed by HDB.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Fourth, the AD (at [20] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>) was of the view that the evidence showed the respondent to have conducted herself “more like a lodger”, paying for expenses only when she was staying at the flat and giving no instructions for its maintenance or upkeep after her relocation to the United Kingdom. The respondent’s email exchanges with the appellant also made no mention of any legal or beneficial interest she had in the flat; and she did not claim any interest in it from the time of Mr Lim’s death until after she was told about his will some two years later. The AD opined that the respondent’s failure to ask about what would happen to the flat following Mr Lim’s demise suggested that she did not think she owned any interest in the flat (at [21] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 From the AD’s consideration of the evidence before it in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>, it is plain that the court’s inquiry into the “actual intentions and desires” of the transferor of the property in issue is a fact-specific one: the totality of the evidence – <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, direct evidence from the transferor if it is available, contemporaneous documentary evidence, and circumstantial evidence – has to be weighed in the balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is with the above principles in mind that I have examined the evidence in this case. Having gone through the evidence, I am satisfied that it speaks to a clear intention on the Deceased’s part to gift the Defendant with a beneficial interest in the Flat by adding her as a joint tenant on 4 July 2014. I explain below my reasons for this finding.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence of the Deceased’s clear intention to gift a beneficial interest in the Flat to the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The Deceased had the benefit of explanation from HDB officers on the effect of the transfer in July 2014</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, on the basis of the evidence adduced by the Defendant, I accept that in taking the necessary steps to effect the transfer of the Flat to the Defendant and himself as joint tenants in July 2014, the Deceased – and indeed the Defendant too – had the benefit of explanation from the HDB officers regarding the procedure for and the nature of the transfer. It will be recalled that in <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Saw Ching</span>, the fact that the applicant transferor was advised by HDB officers on the procedure for and effect of the transfer was an important factor which – in the court’s view – “belied the Applicant’s allegation that she had intended to create a trust in making the transfer” (at [37] of <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Saw Ching)</span>. In the present case, the Defendant gave evidence that the consultation with the HDB officers occurred on two occasions: at the first appointment on 9 May 2014 when the Deceased filled in the application form for the transfer; and at the subsequent appointment on 4 July 2014, when they returned for the signing of “the legal document”.

At this first appointment, the HDB officer would also have gone through the “Terms and Conditions for change in flat ownership”, which would have included matters such as “Manner of Holding” (whether joint tenancy or tenancy in common), as well as the “Important Notes on Change in flat ownership by way of gift”. At the second appointment (“the completion appointment”), the HDB officer would have gone through “the transfer legal instrument, highlighting to the parties who the transferor(s) and transferee(s) are and the manner of holding as per parties’ earlier indication on the application form”, prior to the parties signing the transfer instrument.

</div> In other words, there was ample time for the Deceased to have thought through the transfer, following the explanation received from the HDB officer on 9 May 2014 – and to have changed his mind if he wished. On the evidence adduced, there was no reason why the Deceased should have pressed on with the transfer application if he had any misgivings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Indeed, for that matter, there was no reason why the Deceased should even have taken the initiative to add the Defendant as a joint tenant if his intention all along was to remain the sole beneficial owner of the Flat. The Deceased in this case was in a very different position from the appellants in <span class="font-italic">Low Yan Ni</span>, whose “dire” need for assistance with their mortgage repayments led to their adding both respondents as legal co-owners despite their “vehement” disapproval of the first respondent (at [8]-[9] of <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>). The Deceased’s position is also to be contrasted with that of the late Mr Lim in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>, where the AD found that the evidence supported the appellant’s contention that Mr Lim had added the respondent’s name “as a matter of administrative convenience, and/or because he was concerned that since he did not actually stay at the Flat after 1981 when his wife passed away, the Flat might be repossessed by the HDB if it were not occupied by its owner” (at [19] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>)<span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In this connection, I note that the Claimant has suggested that the Deceased arranged for the Defendant to be added as a joint tenant “in order to facilitate [her] application… to become a Singapore permanent resident”.

</div> On the evidence adduced, it is clear that the failure to attend the formal solemnisation did not in any way signify a change of heart on the Deceased’s part insofar as his love for the Defendant and his wish to provide for her were concerned. As I have earlier pointed out (at [68]-[71] above), the Deceased continued to pay for the Defendant’s hospitalisation insurance and her monthly allowance up to the time of his death; and he also paid for the cost of her diploma studies in massage therapy in March 2016.  Dong Kou also gave evidence that when she stayed with the Defendant at the rented room in the period October to December 2015, the Deceased would drive them around on their outings and join them for meals.

</div> The Claimant places great weight on the case of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>in advancing this argument.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I do not think the AD’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span> is of much assistance to the Claimant. As I pointed out earlier (at [58]), the court’s inquiry into the actual intentions of a transferor of property is a fact-specific process. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>, the AD found that after the late Mr Lim added the respondent as a joint tenant of the Jalan Batu flat in 1981, he also added the applicant as a joint tenant without seeking the respondent’s permission and with no apparent objections from the respondent. Mr Lim also demanded rental from those of his children who stayed in the flat, including the respondent herself. The AD also noted that even though the respondent refused to pay the rental demanded by Mr Lim, she had explained to the appellant that this was “because she had already been paying for the Flat’s renovations and expenses” – not because she was a co-owner of the flat (at [16] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>). In other words, Mr Lim’s actions made it clear that he saw himself as the only person entitled to make decisions about the ownership of the flat and its use, and that he did not see the respondent as a genuine co-owner of the flat. The respondent’s responses to those actions showed that she shared the same understanding.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 No such factors were present in this case. Post the 4 July 2014 transfer, there is no evidence of the Deceased making decisions about the ownership of the Flat and its use as if he were the sole owner. On the contrary, the Deceased gave the Defendant a set of the keys to the Flat,

</div> It is true that their plans to rent out the room eventually came to nought. However, the point is that the Deceased appears to have made efforts to involve the Defendant in arrangements pertaining to the Flat. His conduct was thus very different from that of the late Mr Lim in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 For the reasons I set out above, I reject the Claimant’s argument that the Deceased continued to exercise control over the Flat as if he were its sole owner, even after the transfer in July 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Claimant has also argued that the evidence indicates the Defendant’s awareness that she had no real interest in the property, since she did not sleep overnight in the Flat and took no steps to assert her ownership following the Deceased’s death. I similarly reject this argument. I have examined the affidavit evidence put forward and have had the opportunity in addition to observe the Defendant in the witness stand. She strikes me as a timorous and self-effacing individual who has to be prodded into action and who prefers following others’ lead to taking charge herself. When the Deceased was alive, the Defendant clearly followed his lead; and once he passed away, she was completely bereft.

</div> It is not disputed, moreover, that she is illiterate in English, has no family in Singapore, and appears to have very few friends. In other words, she does not have a strong support network in Singapore. I do not find it at all strange or unbelievable that she would have preferred to stay out of the way of the Claimant, HWF, and the Deceased’s other siblings, and to avoid any overt confrontation with them.

This is based on all the conduct of the parties which sheds light on the common intention between them – rather than simply adopting a purely arithmetic approach with respect to contributions to purchase price (<span class="font-italic">Buthmanaban</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Vaithilingam v Krishnavanny d/o Vaithilingam (administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) and another</span> [2015] SGHC 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Buthmanaban</span>”) at [82]; <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Woon (executor and trustee of the estate of Lai Thai Lok, deceased) v Lai Foong Sin and another</span> [2016] SGHC 113 (“<span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Woon</span>”) at [95]). The common intention constructive trust arises by operation of law from the date of the circumstances giving rise to it and the court simply declares that such a trust has arisen in the past (<span class="font-italic">Sumoi</span><span class="font-italic"> Paramesvaeri v Fleury, Jeffrey Gerard and another</span> [2016] 5 SLR 302 at [61] and [62] citing <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</span> [1996] AC 669 at 714G). Once a common intention between the parties has been made out, there must be detrimental reliance on the party relying on the trust (<span class="font-italic">Ong Chai Soon v Ong Chai Koon and others </span>[2022] 2 SLR 457 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Chai Soon”) </span>at [38]-[39]; <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Woon </span>at [95]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is also crucial to note the distinction between an inferred and an imputed common intention. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, the CA agreed with Lord Neuberger’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Stack v Dowden </span>[2007] 2 AC 432 (“<span class="font-italic">Stack</span>”), where Lord Neuberger (at [125]-[127]) has observed that although an intention may be express or inferred, it may not be imputed by the court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Claimant’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Claimant’s position is that pursuant to a common intention constructive trust, the Defendant and each of the Deceased’s siblings should be entitled to 20% of the Flat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 To recap, the Claimant argues that in this case, the inferred common intention constructive trust approach applies, and the Defendant should be accorded 20% beneficial interest “at the highest”, <span class="font-italic">because </span><span class="font-italic">of the relatively short duration of the marriage, the absence of any children to the marriage, the lack of contribution by the Defendant to the Flat, and the alleged lack of intimacy between the Deceased and Defendant</span>.

</div> The Claimant argues, in addition, that if the Defendant is accorded the same interest as the Deceased’s four siblings, this will mean there are five beneficiaries each with an interest in the Flat; and it will be “reasonable” for each beneficiary to be entitled to a 20% beneficial interest.

In the first place, the Claimant brought the present proceedings in her capacity as the administratrix of the Deceased’s estate: <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, she is in court to represent the Deceased’s estate – and <span class="font-italic">not his four siblings</span>. There is no basis, therefore, for her to seek in these proceedings a five-way apportionment of the Flat as between herself, the Defendant and the Deceased’s other siblings – unless such a five-way apportionment was a common intention between the Defendant and the Deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 More fundamentally, the Claimant has misunderstood the very basis of the doctrine of common intention constructive trusts. This type of trust arises because of a common intention between the parties – not for the types of reasons raised by the Claimant (as summarised in italics in [87] above), which appear to be premised on some vague notion of fairness. Further, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel </span>has made clear (at [83]) that for a common intention constructive trust to arise, “there must be <span class="font-italic">sufficient and compelling evidence </span>of the express or inferred common intention” (emphasis in original).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Regrettably, in the present case, having put forward an alternative case of a common intention constructive trust, the Claimant has been unable to articulate with any coherence the “common intention” relied on, let alone to adduce “sufficient and compelling evidence” of any alleged common intention. It must be remembered that the common intention constructive trust arises at the time of the transfer; and in this case, since the transfer took place as between the Deceased and the Defendant, the relevant “common intention” must have been one that existed as between the Deceased and the Defendant at the time of the transfer on 4 July 2014. Given that the Claimant has submitted that the Defendant and each of the Deceased’s siblings is entitled to 20% of the Flat, her position must be that there was a common intention <span class="font-italic">as between the </span><span class="font-italic">Deceased and the Defendant </span>at the time of the transfer that the Flat would be owned equally by the Defendant and the Deceased’s four siblings, with the Deceased and the Defendant (the registered joint tenants) holding 80% on trust for the four siblings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Assuming this <span class="font-italic">is</span> the Claimant’s position, however, there is simply no evidence of such a common intention, whether express or inferred. Indeed, it appears to me highly improbable that the Deceased would have decided his siblings should each get 20% of the Flat without bothering to tell any of the siblings either before or after effecting the transfer on 4 July 2014.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In any event, when counsel for the Claimant cross-examined the Defendant, nothing was put to her about any alleged common intention she might have shared with the Deceased vis-à-vis the issue of his siblings’ interest in the Flat. The omission to put to the Defendant a clear case on the alternative claim of a common intention constructive trust was telling – and ultimately, fatal to the Claimant’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the reasons given above, I reject the Claimant’s alternative claim of a common intention constructive trust whereby the Defendant and each of the Deceased’s siblings would be entitled to 20% of the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the formation of a trust over the Flat held by the Defendant in favour of the Defendant would contravene s 58(11) of the HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Given my finding that no trust arises over the Flat held by the Defendant, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether the formation of a trust over the Flat would contravene s 58(11) of the HDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In conclusion, I reject the Claimant’s application in whole and allow in part the orders the Defendant is seeking.
