Here, the knowledge that is relevant is that of the accused, and the unexpressed feelings and thoughts of the victim is often irrelevant for the purposes of proving that knowledge. Furthermore, the accused’s knowledge must be assessed in relation to the alleged victim, as can be gleaned from the focus on the outrage of modesty of “<span class="font-italic">that </span>person”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Hence, context is everything.

Unless the accused can avail himself of one of the relevant exceptions in the Penal Code (such as the unsoundness of mind), any allegations by the accused that he did not know that his acts would outrage the victim’s modesty would fly in the face of logic and human experience.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, in cases where the context discloses a relationship (whether romantic or not) between the parties, the objective circumstances in which the alleged OM offence was committed must be carefully assessed against the context to determine whether the accused knew at the material time that his acts would likely outrage the victim’s modesty. This is a two-stage process:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the objective circumstances that are patent to the accused must be determined.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the objective circumstances in (a) must be assessed against the context in which the acts were committed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is to this point which I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The trial judge’s findings as regards the appellant’s knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The trial judge was cognisant of the need to consider the mental state of the appellant at the time of the commission of the alleged offences, and that this mental state had to be assessed against the appropriate context.

In this regard, the appellant was the OC (or covering OC) of the PWs, and held the rank of Inspector. He was a senior officer, while the PWs were only SCs (a lower rank than the appellant) who were serving their national service obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  Viewing the appellant’s acts in light of this superior-subordinate relationship, the trial judge found that the lack of express consent by the PWs to the appellant’s actions, which amounted to intrusions of varying degrees to the PWs’ intimate regions, was sufficient to imbue in the appellant knowledge that his acts would likely outrage the PWs’ modesty.

In this regard, the relationship between PW1 and the accused is critical. PW1 was then performing his national service in the [Singapore Police Force]. He was 19 years old. The accused was an Inspector, his superior and more than 30 years older. The accused was in a position of authority in relation to PW1.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">102 As for the accused’s state of mind, … [t]here is … no evidence to suggest that he could have reasonably believed PW1 was a consenting party. There is no requirement of resistance to prove the absence of consent. I accepted PW1’s description of his state of mind, namely, his ‘freeze’ reaction. He was understandably shocked and embarrassed as he was naked when the accused entered unexpectedly. I accepted his evidence that he ‘froze’. He found himself unable to say anything and the fact that he did not stop the accused cannot be considered as consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, to the trial judge, the absence of verbal consent by PW1, viewed in light of the superior-subordinate relationship between PW1 and the appellant, was sufficient to prove that the appellant had knowledge that his acts would likely outrage PW1’s modesty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Considering the totality of the evidence, I did not agree with the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>in relation to the first, second, fifth and sixth charges. I found that the evidence plainly did not show that the appellant had knowledge that his actions in respect of those charges were likely to outrage the modesty of the PWs.

With respect to the first charge, the appellant had applied hair removal cream to PW1’s pubic and anal region. With respect to the second charge, the appellant applied body scrub to PW1’s naked body, including his buttocks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Viewed in isolation, it would have been obvious that the appellant’s acts were done with the knowledge that they would have likely outraged PW1’s modesty. However, as alluded to at [40] above, in determining the appellant’s knowledge, the objective circumstances must be assessed against the appropriate context. The appellant’s knowledge must be ascertained objectively also by what the appellant himself would have known or been informed from (a) reading PW1’s messages; (b) seeing PW1’s actions, responses, facial expressions and behaviour; and (c) hearing and understanding what PW1 had said to him.  One cannot expect the appellant to be able to read PW1’s mind if PW1 had not in some way expressed himself in words or messages to the appellant or exhibited his emotions and feelings physically through some form of facial or bodily expressions in the view of the appellant.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Objective circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The objective circumstances that were patently before the appellant would shed light on his knowledge at the time of the commission of the acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Here, PW1 went to the appellant’s home, where the appellant gave PW1 instructions on how to remove the hair on his body. The appellant also informed PW1 that the hair removal cream should not be left on for too long as it could burn the skin or cause rashes.

As a result, it was understandable that PW1 failed to sound out his objection to the appellant’s acts.

Such instructions included the appellant touching PW1 in highly sensitive areas, namely his pubic region, anus, and buttocks. However, they were strictly confined to the hair removal and body scrubbing procedure which the appellant had invited PW1 to his home to do.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) PW1 never told the appellant that he was agreeing or consenting to the appellant’s acts. However, notwithstanding the highly intrusive nature of the appellant’s acts, PW1 also did not show any visible signs of objection, alarm or discomfort throughout that extended period of time.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The active participation by PW1 for the hair removal process and the scrubbing procedure would not have appeared to the appellant to be consistent with the conduct of someone who felt that his modesty was outraged. Instead, it would have demonstrated to the appellant that PW1 was a willing participant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 With these, it is appropriate to turn towards the context in which PW1 arrived at the appellant’s home.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The context as disclosed by the messages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 While much weight was placed on the power disparity between the appellant and PW1, a closer inspection of the messages exchanged between them prior to the fateful day when PW1 went to the appellant’s home reveal that the appellant had taken active steps to downplay his superiority, and that the parties had a relationship that belied the formal superior-subordinate relationship they otherwise shared.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 To begin, the appellant started the conversation between the pair by asking PW1 personal questions such as which block PW1 lived in and where PW1’s family was staying.

</div> The appellant picked PW1 shortly after, and the parties arrived at the appellant’s place at around 10:31 am on the same day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The messages show that the parties communicated as equals, and contradict the alleged power disparity between them. It is in this context (rather than as superior and subordinate) that PW1’s compliance to the appellant’s intrusive acts had to be assessed in determining whether the appellant had knowledge that his acts would likely outrage PW1’s modesty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assessment of the appellant’s knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The context reveals that, from the appellant’s perspective, PW1 had willingly arrived at his home for the hair removal and body scrub processes. There was also little to no power disparity between the parties for the purposes of PW1’s visit to the appellant’s home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Viewing the objective circumstances (see [63] above) in light of this context, PW1’s lack of objection over an extended period of time to the appellant’s highly intrusive acts (which were in line with the procedure he had described to PW1 in his message) would not lead to the inference that the appellant knew that his acts would likely outrage PW1’s modesty. The contrary would be the case. In fact, consistent with his expressed intention of helping PW1 get rid of his body odour, after the hair removal and body scrub was complete, the appellant gave PW1 several personal hygiene products, including the body scrub and hair removal cream, before PW1 left his home.

Furthermore, while I noted that the offences took place abruptly such that PW2 could not react to the appellant’s action, such opportunistic behaviour was not unique to the appellant’s case, and was a common element in most OM cases. Hence, I did not regard this aspect of the appellant’s behaviour as aggravating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Nonetheless, the appellant, being the superior of PW2, was in a position of responsibility towards PW2. Instead of exercising responsibility towards PW2, the appellant abused his position, and took liberties with intruding PW2’s personal space on at least two occasions (forming the substance of the third and fourth charges). In this regard, deterrence was clearly relevant, given the difficulty of detection of such offences committed in the workplace, where the subordinates may be wary of speaking out against such untoward conduct of their superior. The requirement to deter such conduct is particularly apposite in this case as the victim (PW2) was a full-time national serviceman, serving his national service liability, and who therefore had little mobility and choice as regards his choice of workplace and superiors. Therefore, I found that the appellant’s abuse of his position of trust vis-à-vis PW2 was an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Harm caused to the victim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As regards the harm caused to the victim, while the Prosecution tendered a victim impact statement of PW2 stating that he became “miserable” and “extremely uncomfortable”, and that he “began losing trust” in people after the incident, the trial judge had found that the victim impact statement was exaggerated.

</div> the offender was convicted after trial on four charges under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for offences committed against his 14-year-old step-daughter. The first charge was for the offender using his hand to squeeze the left side of her buttocks, while the second charge was for using his hand to squeeze her buttock cheeks. The fourth charge was for using his hand to stroke her right buttock area. The third charge was more egregious, and involved him touching her body from her breast to the groin area. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The district judge in <span class="font-italic">Mazlan</span> applied the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>, and sentenced the offender to three months’ imprisonment for the first, second and fourth charges, and a term of eight months’ imprisonment for the third charge. The total sentence was 11 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Two offence-specific aggravating factors were apparent in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Mazlan</span>, namely the abuse of a position of trust and the exploitation of a young, vulnerable victim. However, as regards the first, second and fourth charges, the degree of sexual exploitation was relatively low.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In relation to the third charge in this case, the degree of sexual exploitation was low and there was only one aggravating factor (the abuse of a position of trust). While higher standards may be expected of a law-enforcement officer, I did not think that the sentence of four months’ imprisonment imposed by the trial judge was commensurate with the culpability of the appellant. This was especially so because, as the trial judge observed, “<span class="font-italic">Mazlan’s</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case … involved a graver betrayal of trust and multiple offences against the 14-year-old step-daughter” (GD at [73]). Accordingly, I reduced his sentence for the third charge to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for the fourth charge, given that the appellant’s sentence was lower at ten weeks’ imprisonment, I did not find the trial judge’s sentence manifestly excessive, and accordingly did not disturb it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I also did not disturb the trial judge’s holding that the sentences of the third and fourth charge, which were committed against the same victim, were to run concurrently. This, in my view, was in order with the overall gravity of the appellant’s offending, and would send a sufficiently deterrent message. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As a result, the appellant’s aggregate sentence was reduced from 16 months’ and nine weeks’ imprisonment to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. Given that he had long out-served his sentence by the time the appeal was heard, I ordered his release immediately.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 This was a troubling case. On one hand, it is important to deter unsolicited encroachment of another person’s private space. On the other hand, the law mandates that the appellant must have had knowledge that his acts would likely outrage his victims’ modesty. This was a vital requirement, and failure to prove this was fatal to some of the convictions against the appellant. Hence, it was necessary to undertake a laborious process to determine whether the objective circumstances, considered against the appropriate context, would have been sufficient to imbue in the appellant with such knowledge. As is often emphasised, the Prosecution bears a weighty burden of proving each element of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. Since the Prosecution had failed to prove the first, second, fifth and sixth charges to such a degree, I was duty bound to acquit the appellant on those charges.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mahmood Gaznavi s/o Bashir Muhammad and Khadijah Yasin (Mahmood Gaznavi &amp; Partners) for the appellant;<br/>Nicholas Lai Yi Shin (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
