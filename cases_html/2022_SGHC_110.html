As such, the costs of the services were settled in 2018. This was said to be a “usual setup that a number of companies active in the business choose”.

</div> At the commencement of these proceedings, the Plaintiff primarily sought to recover the Principal Sum from the Defendant. On 23 December 2021, however, HARPA and HPS refunded the Principal Sum to the Plaintiff. This is preceded by a letter from Luther LLP on 1 December 2021 stating that “HARPA and HPS consider their claims against [the Plaintiff] to be well founded”. However, if the payments were seen to be giving them “preferential treatment” over other creditors under Singapore law, they were prepared to repay the sums, and “justify their claims in the same way as the other creditors would do.”

Depending on the nature of the duty involved, different remedial consequences follow. By way of example, the breach of a non-custodial fiduciary duty (namely, the duty to act in good faith, the duty of no-conflict and the duty of no-profit) entitles a claimant to the relief of equitable compensation. In contrast, the breach of the duty of care and diligence only allows the claimant to obtain the common law remedy of compensatory damages measurable by reference to the losses suffered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As it stands, the Plaintiff’s case appears to centre heavily on demonstrating that the Defendant breached core fiduciary duties.

Apart from HARPA and HPS, the Plaintiff owed OIG, a sum of S$1,805,568.10. The Plaintiff would not have had sufficient assets to satisfy all the Plaintiff’s creditors. Consequently, HARPA and HPS were unlikely to have received the full sum of moneys owing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Fourth, the Payments occurred within the relevant time frame of two years from the date of the making of the winding up application (19 April 2020 by OIG).

Accordingly, the payees, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, HARPA and HPS, bear the burden to rebut the presumption that the Payments were not influenced by the Plaintiff’s desire to prefer the payees. The Defendant has not sought to do so and indeed, HARPA and HPS have repaid the Payments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Based on the above, I find that the Payments were unfair preference payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant failed to determine or ascertain whether the Plaintiff or the other directors should have facilitated the Payments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Plaintiff’s quarrel with the Defendant concerns his omissions or inaction in relation to the Payments, in particular, for failing to determine whether it was permissible for the Plaintiff to make the Payments and for failing to ascertain to ascertain whether the <span class="font-italic">other directors</span> were acting in breach of their various duties in facilitating the Payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my view, it is clear that the Defendant neither determined whether it was permissible for the Plaintiff to make the Payments nor ascertained whether the other directors acted in accordance with their duties in facilitating the Payments.

To reiterate, on the Defendant’s account, he was only informed about the Payments by the Finance Manager subsequently, and that the Payments were authorised by the other directors.

</div> it is unclear whether the Plaintiff’s position is that the Defendant had actual knowledge or that the Defendant should have known about the Payments. In any event, I find that the evidence does not support either formulation of the Plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29  I begin with the affidavit of Mr Aw Cheok Huat (“Mr Aw”) dated 5 July 2021 at paragraph 41, in reply to the Defendant’s denial of responsibility for the impugned transactions on the basis that it was the “other directors of [the Plaintiff] and the H&amp;P German’s finance department” which allegedly authorised the Payments. Mr Aw’s affidavit highlights that the Defendant was aware that the Plaintiff had other creditors apart from HARPA and HPS, such as OIG, based on the signed audited financial statements of the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant’s answer to a question in the 15 June 2021 letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On the face of Mr Aw’s response, it is unclear how this meets the Defendant’s point that he was unaware of the Payments, and that the Payments were authorised by the other directors of the Plaintiff. The mere fact that the Defendant was aware that there were other creditors does not mean that the Defendant knew or should have known about the Payments. Looking at the signed audited financial statements, the statements do not go any further than to indicate that the Defendant would have been aware of the debt owing to OIG. In fact, on a holistic assessment of the 15 June 2021 letter, the Defendant’s answers to questions 22 to 36 (including question 26) are <span class="font-italic">consistent</span> with the Defendant’s contention that he did not know that the Payments had occurred. Without more, the documents are of little use in showing that the Defendant was aware of the Payments. Indeed, I also note that it was the Defendant’s position that he did not know about the Repayments from HPSH prior to the Payments (in reply to question 16 of the 15 June 2021 letter).

At best, the documents demonstrate that had the Defendant known about payments being made to HARPA and HPS, the Defendant would have known that these were likely to be unfair preference payments. Fundamentally, these documents do not go towards the anterior factual question of whether the Defendant was aware that the payments were made to HARPA or HPS. Similarly, the Plaintiff does not demonstrate how these documents would have placed the Defendant in a position such that he should have been aware that payments were being made to HARPA or HPS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I only wish to add one point in relation to the Defendant’s conduct vis-à-vis the financial statements. As explained by the former directors in the 11 September 2020 letter, arising from the arrangements within the group of companies, the amounts to be paid to HARPA and HPS were only finalised for settlement in 2018. Even though I found that the Payments to be unfair preference payments (which should not have been made), I did not accept the Plaintiff’s contention that there was something amiss in finalising the amounts due to HPS and HARPA only in 2018.

However, the evidence <span class="font-italic">does not</span> demonstrate that the Defendant knew or should have known about the Payments. In fact, I should point out that prayer one of Plaintiff’s originating summons seems to tacitly accept that the other directors (and not the Defendant) were responsible for facilitating the payment of the Principal Sum.

The liquidator also concurrently brought a claim against the defendant for breach of her fiduciary duties in procuring undue preferences. The court agreed that the transactions constituted unfair preference payments, and that such a finding “<span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>led to the conclusion that the conclusion that [the defendant] breached her fiduciary duty to ensure that the company’s assets were not misapplied to the prejudice of creditors’ interests” (see [78]).  The court also observed that, “[t]he fact that the purpose of this duty mirrors that of the statutory avoidance provisions makes this inference practically inevitable in every case although I accept that <span class="font-italic">there may be exceptional circumstances where a director may be found to have acted bona fide in the best interests of the company even though he or she might have procured an undue preference ...</span>” [emphasis added] (see [78]). Consequentially, the court ordered that the defendant be required to restore the company to the position it would otherwise have been, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to repay the sum of the total value of the undue preference (see [87] and [90]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Plaintiff, in relying on <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span>, seems to suggest that the Defendant breached his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of the company, as he did not ensure that its assets were not misapplied to the prejudice of some creditors. However, <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> is readily distinguishable. In <span class="font-italic">Living </span><span class="font-italic">the Link</span>, there was no dispute as to the defendant’s involvement in executing the transactions in question (at [11]), and the liquidator’s claim against the defendant was for her procurement of the transactions (at [5]). In contrast, the Defendant’s offending act consists of the failure to prevent certain payments (which he was not aware of). In other words, the nature of the offending conduct giving rise to the purported breach of obligation greatly differs. Without more, the Plaintiff cannot baldly rely on <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> for the submission that the Defendant has breached his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of the company by failing to perform the requisite checks. This is especially so considering the absence of evidence to suggest that the Defendant knew or should have known about the Payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the course of oral submissions, the Plaintiff argues in the alternative that <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the Defendant did not know about the Payments, this was insufficient to excuse the Defendant from any liability. In this connection, the Plaintiff relies on <span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ho Soo Fong and another </span>[2020] SGHC 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim</span>”) at [100], where the court held that the second defendant was not absolved of liability on the basis that he was a “sleeping” or “nominee” director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim</span>, the liquidators of the company commenced a suit against the defendants (who were the ex-directors of the company) for failing to recover a sum of moneys from related parties. The second defendant therein argued that he was a “sleeping” director (at [19]). Flowing from this, the second defendant averred that he was unaware of his obligations to the company and left the management of the company fully to the first defendant (at [17] to [20]). The court rejected the second defendant’s argument based on his extensive involvement in the running of the company (at [86], [88] and [100]). In particular, the second defendant had signed a financial statement which would have informed him that there were moneys owing from related parties and was also a shareholder and director of the related parties (at [88] and [89]). In these circumstances, the court found at [89] that the second defendant “knew that the Related Parties were HTS and IH and he was equally privy to the decision to collect the $3.59m Sum from them to the prejudice of [the plaintiff company] and its creditor, Revitech” and was thus in breach of his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim</span> is of limited assistance to the Plaintiff. There, the court made a <span class="font-italic">factual</span> finding that the defendant was not a mere “sleeping” or “nominee” director, and was, on the contrary, aware of the moneys owing from the related parties that were not collected. Thus, the defendant was held to be in breach of his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona </span><span class="font-italic">fide</span> in the best interests of the company. In contrast, the Plaintiff has not shown that the Defendant was aware (or placed in a position such that he should have been) of the payments of the Principal Sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As such, I am not satisfied that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that the Defendant breached his fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of the Plaintiff and its creditors, by failing to determine whether it was permissible for the Plaintiff or the other directors to have facilitated or made payments of the Principal Sum. At the nub of the matter, the Plaintiff has not shown that the Defendant was aware or should have been aware of the Payments. In such circumstances, the Defendant’s failures cannot be described as unreasonable or dishonest. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant was in breach of his duty to exercise skill, care and diligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Plaintiff’s submissions on the Defendant’s duty to exercise skill, care and diligence is primarily based in <span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim</span>, which was raised in the course of oral submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In <span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim</span>, the court found that <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the second defendant was a “sleeping” director, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the second defendant was unaware of his obligations and the ongoings of the company, the second defendant was still in breach of his duty to exercise skill, care and diligence (at [100]). The second defendant was “not a greenhorn to business or to [the plaintiff company]” (at [97]). In particular, the court observed that it would “not have gone unnoticed” to the second defendant, had he taken some steps to monitor the company’s management, that the company’s main asset was the moneys owed from the related parties which remained uncollected (at [97]). This was further in the context that the second defendant should have known that the company, by way of various court decisions, owed money to creditors (at [97]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Beyond a bare reliance on <span class="font-italic">Ho Pak Kim</span>, again, the Plaintiff does not provide any particularisation of the manner in which the Defendant’s omissions were in breach of his duty to exercise skill, care and diligence. The Plaintiff also does not make clear what the Defendant’s experience and background was, and what was expected of the Defendant in the circumstances. For instance, was the Defendant required to review all telegraphic transfers by the Plaintiff in the period on the basis that the Plaintiff was nearing insolvency and/or insolvent? Did the other directors’ actions in financial and operational matters give rise to any concerns such that Defendant should have been more closely monitoring the company’s management? In this respect, the Plaintiff does not provide any evidence or make any arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In assessing whether it was reasonable that the Defendant was unaware of the payments of the Principal Sum, I further note that the Defendant is the sole local director of the Plaintiff. On the Defendant’s account, the other two directors were the material directors who had full management and conduct of the Plaintiff’s business operations and financial matters.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s written submissions at paragraph 6.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This is not disputed by the Plaintiff. While this does not absolve the Defendant of his duties, it impacts the extent to which the Defendant is expected to be informed of the Plaintiff’s affairs. This was also recognised in <span class="font-italic">Prima </span><span class="font-italic">Bulkship Pte Ltd (in creditor’s voluntary liquidation) and another v Lim Say Wan and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 839 at [49] where the court recognised that the fact that the defendants were appointed to fulfil the statutory requirement of a local resident director impacted the extent to which the defendants were expected to be informed of the company’s affairs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As such, I do not find that the Defendant failed to exercise due care, skill and diligence. Materially, it is unclear what was expected from the Defendant, and what was the basis for such an expectation, especially having regard to the Defendant’s seemingly limited role in the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In sum, I find that the Defendant did not breach any of his fiduciary or statutory duties as a director of the Plaintiff. While the Defendant has, indeed, failed to check whether the Plaintiff or the other directors should have made or facilitated the Payments, the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Defendant knew or should have known about these Payments. Also, the circumstances were not such that the Defendant was put on the alert about the conduct of the other directors, and therefore should have checked on any payments which they authorised even though the Plaintiff was insolvent or nearing insolvency. This, consequentially, undermined the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant was in breach of his duties. As explained earlier, the finding that the Defendant has breached his statutory or fiduciary duties is the premise of the Plaintiff’s case for Additional Damages. Given that I do not find that the Defendant has breached his duties, the Plaintiff’s claim for Additional Damages necessarily falls away. I therefore say no more about this. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Before I conclude, I note that the Defendant had applied for the originating summons to be converted to a writ by way of HC/SUM 3987/2021, so that the substantial disputes in relation to the Payments, as well as his conduct may be tested at a trial. In fact, the Defendant wanted Mr Harren and Dr Harren to be called as witnesses at the trial – to ascertain their intentions in making the Payments (which would, in turn, throw light on the Defendant’s conduct at the material time). However, the Plaintiff objected to the application, and the application was not allowed. Further, the Plaintiff did not apply for cross-examination of the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Given the Plaintiff’s stance, I do not have the benefit of having the Defendant’s evidence tested in cross-examination, or having full evidence from the other relevant witnesses, in order to determine the Defendant’s knowledge and state of mind which form the nub of the case (as indicated at [14]). Instead, I am left to assess the case based on the affidavits and documentary evidence. For reasons I have stated above, in light of the Defendant’s consistent explanations, I find that the Plaintiff has failed to prove the Defendant’s breach of fiduciary and/or statutory duty. Accordingly, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s prayers for damages against the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Parties may provide cost submissions within two weeks of this judgment. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ponnampalam Sivakumar and Phang Shi Ting (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; <br/>Lai Kwok Seng (Lai Mun Onn &amp; Co) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
