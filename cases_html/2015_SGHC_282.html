<p>[LawNet Editorial Note: The defendant’s appeal to this decision in Civil Appeal No 213 of 2015 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 9 May 2016 with no written grounds of decision rendered. The Court of Appeal largely endorsed the findings of the High Court, save in one respect. The Court of Appeal accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the original agreement though it had been structured as an investment in the property was in fact a loan. However, this had no bearing on the appeal. In the Court of Appeal’s judgment, on the facts of this case, it was dealing with a one-off moneylending transaction rather than a party who was carrying on the business of moneylending without a licence. Accordingly, s 14 of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) did not apply and therefore the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.]</p>

        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff says that on 11 October 2010,
                    he entered into an agreement with the defendant (“the October 2010
                    Agreement”) under which the defendant promised to transfer to the
                    plaintiff a 46.5% stake in a strata title property (“the
                    KG Avenue Unit”) in consideration for the release from debt
                    owed to the plaintiff. The October 2010 Agreement is the last in a series of
                    agreements signed by the parties that date back to April 2008. The
                    defendant’s position is that no contract was made on 11 October 2010
                    because he did not agree to the plaintiff’s offer and the plaintiff did
                    not provide good consideration for the October 2010 Agreement. In any event,
                    even if a contract existed, it would be unenforceable because the underlying
                    transaction entered into in April 2008 offended the laws against
                    moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Both parties are businessmen. They share the
                    same surname but have no familial relationship to each other at all. They met in
                    2007 shortly after the defendant acquired an office property adjacent to the
                    plaintiff’s business premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff owns and runs a software
                    development company called “Hiwire Data &amp; Security Pte Ltd”.
                    His office is located at 200 Jalan Sultan, #08-06, Textile Centre, Singapore.
                    The defendant purchased the neighbouring office unit, #08-07, Textile Centre
                    (“Unit 08 TC”), on 20 July 2007 and sub-divided it into
                    two office units which, from time to time thereafter, were rented out to third
                    parties. The defendant is a part-time property agent and an active investor in
                    the property market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Whilst the parties participated in a number of
                    agreements, their perspectives on the facts before the court are diametrically
                    opposed to each other. The dichotomy arises from the defendant’s portrayal
                    of the plaintiff as a moneylender seeking to recover an extortionate loan and
                    the plaintiff’s portrayal of himself as a businessman who was persuaded by
                    the defendant to enter into an investment in property which subsequently
                    entangled him in a whole series of transactions with the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to the plaintiff, the parties shared a
                    friendly relationship. The defendant brought fruit to the plaintiff’s
                    office and gave him mooncakes during the mid-autumn festival. Both parties also
                    went out for lunch or coffee breaks together, sometimes with a few of the
                    plaintiff’s employees. The plaintiff and defendant had a number of casual
                    discussions which often revolved around property investments. The defendant says
                    otherwise. According to him, the parties were merely casual acquaintances and
                    not very familiar with each other. They went out together for meals only
                    occasionally and, when they did, they paid for their own meals. They never
                    discussed property investments; instead, the plaintiff would remind the
                    defendant to repay the sums allegedly borrowed from him. Any food given to the
                    plaintiff was given out of courtesy and because the plaintiff had seen the
                    defendant carrying it around.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The agreements between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Between 24 April 2008 and 11 October
                    2010, the parties entered into seven alleged agreements on six occasions. The
                    first and last of these agreements are the most crucial in this
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first agreement: the 24 April 2008 Option to Purchase
                Unit 08 TC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant says that he approached the
                    plaintiff for a loan on 23 April 2008 because he urgently needed money and
                    the plaintiff’s office was right next to Unit 08 TC. According
                    to the plaintiff, the defendant claimed to have exercised an option to purchase
                    200 Jalan Sultan, #18-08, Textile Centre (“Unit 18 TC”), a
                    residential unit in the same building as the parties’ offices. The
                    defendant explained that his co-investor had backed out from the purchase and he
                    urgently needed $240,000 to complete the purchase the following
                day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendant then offered to sell
                    Unit 08 TC to the plaintiff for $240,000 on the condition that he
                    could “buy back” the option from the plaintiff by 28 July 2008 for
                    $340,000. According to the plaintiff, the defendant was willing to buy the
                    option back at a price which would give the plaintiff a profit of $100,000
                    because he was anticipating a capital gain of $400,000 if he completed the
                    purchase of Unit 18 TC; its market value was $680,000 at that time
                    whereas the price at which the defendant was buying it was only $280,000. The
                    defendant proposed that if he was unable to buy back the option, the plaintiff
                    would be entitled to act on it and complete the purchase of Unit 08 TC
                    for $240,000. The plaintiff was initially hesitant; but ultimately accepted the
                    defendant’s offer after being assured that it was in order and that the
                    defendant would definitely “buy back” the option since
                    Unit 08 TC was worth more than $240,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 24 April 2008, the defendant granted the
                    plaintiff an option to purchase Unit 08 TC for $240,000 (“the
                    April 2008 Option”). The plaintiff says that the defendant prepared the
                    option, whereas the defendant says the opposite. The April 2008 Option was
                    signed at the office of, and witnessed by, Mr Mak Kok Weng (“Mr
                    Mak”), an advocate and solicitor. The purchase price of the unit stated
                    on the April 2008 Option was $300,000 instead of $240,000, but this made little
                    difference to the plaintiff for two reasons: first, the price was essentially
                    academic as the defendant had assured the plaintiff that he would buy back the
                    option and, secondly, even if the defendant did not do so, the plaintiff would
                    be unlikely to suffer a capital loss despite having to pay an extra $60,000 to
                    complete the purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff duly exercised the April 2008
                    Option and tendered three cashier’s orders for a total sum of $240,000 on
                    the same day. On 28 April 2008, Mr Mak lodged a caveat over
                    Unit 08 TC on the plaintiff’s behalf (“the April
                    2008 Caveat”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second agreement: the July 2008 Joint Venture Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On or about 24 July 2008, a few days
                    before the expiry of the period to buy back the April 2008 Option, the defendant
                    told the plaintiff that he could not raise the $340,000 needed to exercise his
                    repurchase right. The plaintiff says that the defendant asked him to waive his
                    rights under the April 2008 Option and instead enter into a joint venture
                    agreement under which the plaintiff would be deemed to have contributed $340,000
                    to the purchase of Unit 18 TC (for clarity I repeat that this was the
                    residential unit that the defendant had purchased in April 2008 with the funds
                    derived from the April 2008 Option).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The parties signed a joint venture agreement
                    the same day (“the July 2008 JVA”). Under this agreement, the
                    defendant was to sell Unit 18 TC and the plaintiff would be entitled
                    to the first $340,000 of the sale proceeds and half of any net sale proceeds
                    beyond the first $680,000. The plaintiff says that this document was prepared by
                    the defendant whereas the defendant says that the plaintiff prepared and asked
                    him to sign it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Additionally, the plaintiff says that the
                    defendant agreed that if he defaulted on the July 2008 JVA, the plaintiff would
                    be entitled to buy Unit 18 TC for $476,000 (<em>ie</em>, by paying another $136,000 above his deemed contribution of
                    $340,000). This, however, was a verbal agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third agreement: the August 2008 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     According to the plaintiff, on 15 August
                    2008, the defendant asked him to vary his rights under the July 2008 JVA by
                    accepting a 10-year repayment plan on a principal sum of $340,000, under which
                    the defendant would pay:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     $3,418.15 per month for the first
                        two years (representing the monthly instalment of principal and interest at
                        3.85% per annum);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     $3,437.79 per month for the third to the tenth year (representing the
                        monthly instalment of principal and interest at 4% per annum);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     $1,000 per
                        month (representing the plaintiff’s share of rental
                    income).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     This variation agreement (“the August
                    2008 Agreement”) was handwritten by the defendant. It has two interesting
                    features. First, the property referenced in this agreement was not
                    Unit 18 TC but Unit 08 TC. Secondly, it provided that there
                    would be “no sharing of selling profits”. The plaintiff says that
                    the defendant did not give him any reason for this but he suspected that the
                    defendant was acting on rumours of an <em>en bloc</em> sale
                    of Textile Centre; the plaintiff thought that the value of Unit 18 TC
                    would be assessed at about $1.5m and that the defendant did not want to share
                    this windfall with the plaintiff. The plaintiff says that the defendant proposed
                    the terms of the August 2008 Agreement and that he accepted those terms. The
                    defendant’s explanation, however, is that the plaintiff insisted on the
                    change for his own benefit because the value of the residential property
                        (<em>ie</em>, Unit 18 TC) had fallen below
                    that of the commercial property (<em>ie</em>,
                    Unit 08 TC) in the light of the financial crisis. At the trial,
                    however, he said he was forced to enter into this agreement because the
                    plaintiff did not pay $136,000 under the July 2008 Agreement. According to him,
                    the plaintiff dictated the terms of the August 2008 Agreement to him and that
                    was why the document was in his handwriting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After the agreement was signed, the defendant
                    commenced the payment of the monthly instalments via bank
                transfers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fourth and fifth agreements: the November 2008 Deed and the
                November 2008 Option to Purchase Unit 08 TC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According to the plaintiff, shortly before
                    28 November 2008 the defendant visited him and proposed replacing the
                    August 2008 Agreement with a set of twin agreements. The plaintiff accepted the
                    offer. Unsurprisingly, the defendant says that it was the plaintiff who drafted
                    these agreements and asked the defendant to sign them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     One of these agreements was a deed
                    (“the November 2008 Deed”) under which the defendant promised to
                    pay:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     $3,418.15 per month for the first
                        two years;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     $3,437.79 per month for the third to the <em>ninth</em> year (the plaintiff, however, says that this was a
                        mistake and the monthly payments should be made in the tenth year as well);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     $1,000 per
                        month from the rental received from the tenant of Unit 08 TC until
                        the defendant pays up the principal sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Under cl 3 of the November 2008 Deed, the defendant was entitled to
                        discharge the deed at any time by paying the balance of the principal sum
                        due to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The other agreement was an option to purchase
                    Unit 08 TC for $350,000 (“the November 2008 Option”)
                    issued by the defendant in the plaintiff’s favour. Clause 2b of this
                    option provided that if the defendant defaulted on the payments under the
                    November 2008 Deed for six months, the plaintiff would be entitled to either
                    complete the purchase of Unit 08 TC or sell Unit 08 TC in
                    the open market and apply the sale proceeds in satisfaction of the outstanding
                    sum owed to him by the defendant. The defendant was also entitled, under
                    cl 3 of this option, to pay “all dues instalment” to
                    “reinstate” cl 2b; the plaintiff says he understood this to
                    mean that the defendant could prevent the plaintiff from exercising his rights
                    under cl 2b by paying all overdue instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff duly exercised the November 2008
                    Option. The signing of the acceptance copy of this option was apparently
                    witnessed by Mr Mak again (even though he did not remember it). However, a
                    fresh caveat was never lodged over Unit 08 TC because the April 2008
                    Caveat (which had been lodged against Unit 08 TC on the basis of the
                    April 2008 Option) had not been discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The penultimate agreement: the April 2009 Variation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     By the end of February 2009, the defendant had
                    made five monthly payments of $3,418.15 and five monthly payments of $1,000. In
                    March 2009, the defendant paid the plaintiff $200 instead of $1,000. The reason
                    for this is disputed. The plaintiff says that the defendant simply wanted to pay
                    less, but the defendant says that Unit 08 TC was vacant by then and
                    accordingly no rental was due under the November 2008 Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 1 April 2009, the defendant proposed
                    varying the November 2008 Deed into a 9-year repayment plan at an interest
                    rate of 5% per annum for the first year from 1 April 2009 and 6% per annum
                    for the remaining period, in lieu of giving the plaintiff a share in the rental.
                    This meant that the defendant was to pay the plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     $3,753.54 per month for one year;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     $3,896.51
                        per month subsequently, until the principal sum is
                repaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff says that he reluctantly
                    accepted these terms. This agreement (“the April 2009 Variation”)
                    was never put in writing. The defendant’s position is that the plaintiff
                    foisted these terms on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Thereafter, the defendant paid the plaintiff
                    $3,753.54 per month for 12 months until March 2010. From 1 April 2010
                    onwards, he paid $3,896.51 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The last agreement: the October 2010 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 11 October 2010, the undisputed
                    outstanding principal sum was $279,352. The defendant went to the
                    plaintiff’s office and told the plaintiff that he had, on 9 September
                    2010, exercised an option to purchase the unit known as Block 803, King
                    George’s Avenue, #02-168, Singapore 200803
                    (“the KG Avenue Unit”) at $430,000. The defendant
                    was to hold this property with an investment partner, Tan Nguan Cher
                    (“NC Tan”), as tenants-in-common in the proportions of 97%
                    and 3% respectively. It transpired that the KG Avenue Unit had been
                    previously held by the defendant and NC Tan as tenants-in-common in equal
                    shares; they had sold it in January 2009 to the then tenant of the unit for
                    $380,000 subject to a right to repurchase it for $430,000 within an 18-month
                    window. They subsequently exercised this right as the value of the
                    KG Avenue Unit had risen above $430,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     According to the plaintiff, the defendant
                    offered to settle the outstanding principal sum of $279,352 in the following
                    way: in return for the plaintiff’s promise to waive his rights under the
                    November 2008 Option, the defendant would pay the plaintiff $79,352 and deem the
                    remaining $200,000 to have been contributed towards 46.5% of the repurchase
                    price of the KG Avenue Unit so that the plaintiff would receive a
                    46.5% share in the KG Avenue Unit upon completion of the repurchase.
                    Were this settlement to be executed, the plaintiff, the defendant and
                    NC Tan would hold the property as tenants-in-common in the proportions of
                    46.5%, 50.5% and 3% respectively. The plaintiff claims to have been assured by
                    the defendant that his name could be included as a tenant-in-common because the
                    option to repurchase the KG Avenue Unit had stated
                    “[NC Tan] … and [the defendant] … and/or <em>nominee(s)</em> [emphasis added]” and that the
                    defendant alone could make all the decisions regarding the
                    KG Avenue Unit. The defendant, however, denies having made such
                    representations. According to him, the plaintiff wanted to exploit the
                    defendant’s situation when he learnt of the defendant’s intention to
                    repurchase the KG Avenue Unit at $430,000. At the time, the defendant
                    needed a bank loan to finance the repurchase of the KG Avenue Unit.
                    Pending the approval of the bank loan (which was eventually extended to him),
                    the defendant says that he approached the plaintiff for a further loan. While
                    the plaintiff did not extend this loan, he proposed to set off moneys then owing
                    by the defendant for a share in the KG Avenue Unit. Eventually, this
                    proposal was embodied in the October 2010 Agreement which was in truth a
                    proposal and not a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 11 October 2010, the parties signed
                    the October 2010 Agreement. On the same day, the plaintiff authorised a firm of
                    advocates and solicitors to withdraw his caveat over Unit 08 TC. The
                    defendant, however, continued to make monthly payments of $3,896.51. His
                    position is that the terms of the October 2010 Agreement were never accepted by
                    him even though he signed it. The proposal could not become a contract without
                    NC Tan’s approval, which was never obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     According to the plaintiff, the defendant
                    later claimed to have had problems in completing the repurchase of the
                    KG Avenue Unit because the owner was reluctant to complete the sale
                    due to the low purchase price. The defendant told the plaintiff that he would
                    not include the plaintiff’s name as a nominee because his lawyer had
                    advised him that the seller might otherwise have an excuse to dispute, void or
                    delay the sale. The defendant promised to transfer a 46.5% interest in the
                    KG Avenue Unit once the title passed to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Although the purchase of the
                    KG Avenue Unit was eventually completed on 8 November 2011, the
                    plaintiff only found out about this on 1 January 2012, when the defendant
                    told him that he would not be transferring the 46.5% share in the
                    KG Avenue Unit to the plaintiff. Instead, the defendant tendered a
                    cheque for $240,515.17 (an amount which the plaintiff understood to represent
                    the outstanding principal sum at that time) and asked the plaintiff to discharge
                    him from his obligations under the October 2010 Agreement. The plaintiff
                    rejected the cheque and asked for the share in the KG Avenue Unit
                    which he had been promised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff says that while he delayed legal
                    action on account of his friendship with the defendant, the defendant’s
                    dilatory behaviour eventually led the plaintiff to seek legal advice. The
                    parties had corresponded in various ways and the documentary trail shows that
                    the plaintiff kept making demands which the defendant practically
                    ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 23 October 2012, Advent Law
                    Corporation, the solicitors for the plaintiff, sent a letter to the defendant,
                    demanding the transfer of a 46.5% interest in the KG Avenue Unit to
                    the plaintiff. On 6 March 2013, the plaintiff sent another letter to the
                    defendant, accusing the latter of failing to transfer the 46.5% share in the
                    KG Avenue Unit to him and demanding an unconditional return of
                    $200,000 within seven days on the threat of legal action. On 29 March 2013,
                    the defendant sent the plaintiff an e-mail showing that he transferred $3,896.51
                    to the plaintiff’s bank account on 28 March 2013. The plaintiff
                    replied, later that day, saying that the defendant only owed $1,549.42 (which,
                    to the plaintiff, represented the balance of $79,352 that the defendant had
                    agreed to pay under the October 2010 Agreement). The plaintiff purported to
                    treat the remaining $2,347.09 as part payment for the sum of $200,000 which he
                    said the defendant owed. However, he demanded the balance in weekly instalments
                    of $50,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The weekly instalments of $50,000 demanded
                    never came. On 1 April 2013, the defendant paid $3,896.51 to the plaintiff.
                    The defendant wrote to the plaintiff again on 8 April 2013, asking the
                    plaintiff to verify that the outstanding principal sum was $195,757.65. The
                    plaintiff replied on 11 April 2013, stating that the principal sum was
                    $195,757.44 (the difference was caused by the plaintiff’s rounding off of
                    certain figures to the nearest dollar). The last straw came when the defendant
                    paid another $3,896.51 on 1 May 2013. On 7 May 2013, the plaintiff
                    wrote to the defendant, stating that the monthly instalments were unacceptable
                    and that he was entitled to a 46.5% share in the KG Avenue Unit under
                    the October 2010 Agreement. He purported to return the 1 May 2013 payment
                    by issuing a cheque to the defendant for $8,139.07 and on the same day commenced
                    this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the parties’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff’s case is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     the October 2010 Agreement is valid
                        and enforceable; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     the defendant breached the agreement by either completing the
                        purchase of the KG Avenue Unit without including the plaintiff as
                        a tenant-in-common holding a 46.5% interest or, failing thereafter, to
                        transfer a 46.5% interest in the KG Avenue Unit to the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendant’s case, in substance, is
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     the October 2010 Agreement was a
                        proposal to which the defendant never agreed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     no consideration moved from the plaintiff under
                        the October 2010 Agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     in any event, the October 2010 Agreement and the November
                        2008 Deed are unenforceable under s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act
                        (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) and at common
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The issues as regards the liability, if any,
                    of the defendant to the plaintiff, appear clearly from the above summary.
                    Briefly, they are as to the existence of the October 2010 Agreement, whether
                    there was consideration for the same and, whether the underlying transaction was
                    an illegal moneylending one covered by the Act, thus rendering the October 2010
                    Agreement unenforceable. If the defendant is found liable, further issues will
                    arise regarding what remedy would be appropriate for the plaintiff in the
                    circumstances of the case. I will delineate those later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The credibility of the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Before I discuss the substantive issues that
                    arise, I must deal with the credibility of the defendant. Generally, he did not
                    strike me as a credible witness. There are three broad reasons for
                this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The first set of reasons concerns the fact
                    that the defendant suppressed his understanding of the English language and his
                    financial sophistication. For example, he asserted that he was unable to draft
                    options to purchase property when the same contained special features (as the
                    April 2008 Option did) and had to ask the plaintiff to explain certain clauses
                    to him. I find this extremely hard to believe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Although the defendant testified in Mandarin,
                    the evidence and his conduct showed that he is proficient in the English
                    language. All the instances of written communication from the defendant are in
                    English. The standard of grammar and vocabulary displayed is more than
                    rudimentary. The defendant accepts that the handwritten annotations and terms on
                    the agreements, which are all in English, were almost exclusively written by
                    him. He says that almost all the annotations made by him were dictated to him by
                    the plaintiff. I find it very hard to believe that the plaintiff would have
                    dictated to the defendant every handwritten annotation and term in the
                    agreements. The more important point, however, is that the defendant’s
                    command of the English language was adequate. Even though the defendant said
                    that his written English was better than his spoken English, he understood many
                    questions posed to him in English during cross-examination and re-examination
                    even before they were translated into Mandarin. He was also able to read out
                    portions of documents written in English.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant also seemed to be a shrewd and
                    financially savvy investor. The defendant was awarded a diploma in life
                    insurance in 1992. He admitted after some probing that the life insurance course
                    had been conducted in English (though he maintained that there was some Mandarin
                    interpretation) and that the text books were written in English. Someone with
                    only a basic command of the language would have found it very difficult to
                    successfully complete such a course. The defendant also attended some property
                    or investment seminars to help him make investments. By 2008, he had had at
                    least five years’ experience as a part-time estate agent and, by his own
                    admission, he had completed at least three or four transactions. When Wintz Lim,
                    one of the plaintiff’s employees, needed to rent a room, he found the
                    defendant to be a satisfactory property agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The defendant stated confidently that as an
                    investor he bought properties for long-term investment. He maintained a
                    “spare fund” with his business partner in order to be able to
                    seize investment opportunities as they arose, and he was willing to finance the
                    acquisition of properties by using overdraft facilities in order to overcome a
                    lack of ready cash. The defendant had at least three business partners who each
                    invested with him in different properties. By 2010, the defendant was already
                    the owner of five properties: Unit 08 TC, Unit 18 TC, the
                    KG Avenue Unit, the unit known as 462 Crawford Lane, #02-37,
                    Singapore 190462, and the unit known as 2 Rochor Road, #06-590,
                    Singapore 180002. In cross-examination, he conceded that he did “know a
                    bit” about investing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the light of all this evidence, the
                    defendant’s claim that he could not understand certain clauses in the
                    April 2008 Option, as well as his other claims that he was neither competent in
                    English nor financially sophisticated, must be viewed with great
                    suspicion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Next, the defendant downplayed his friendship
                    with the plaintiff and repeatedly accused him of being devious and manipulative.
                    It appears to me that the defendant was not truthful in this regard. First,
                    although the plaintiff and his staff consistently took the position that the
                    defendant brought fruit to their office, the defendant’s denial was heard
                    for the first time only during cross-examination and was never put to the
                    plaintiff or his staff members. Secondly, the defendant also had lunch and tea
                    with the plaintiff on a number of occasions. The plaintiff’s employee,
                    Wintz Lim, was also invited to lunch while another employee, Tan Jong Chuan,
                    joined them on at least one occasion. According to both the plaintiff and Tan
                    Jong Chuan, the parties’ conversations often revolved around property
                    investments, prices, trends and events. Again, the defendant’s denial was
                    heard for the first time in cross-examination and his position was not put to
                    the plaintiff or Tan Jong Chuan. The defendant in fact went on to claim that the
                    parties seldom talked during lunch and that, if they did, the plaintiff would
                    mention the alleged loan he gave to the defendant. However, I cannot understand
                    why the defendant would want to have meals with the plaintiff if the plaintiff
                    was constantly harping on the alleged loan. Further, the defendant has not
                    accounted for conversations in the many months <em>before</em> the transaction on 24 April 2008 was entered into,
                    during which the plaintiff obviously could not have been talking about any
                    alleged loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The third point concerns the fact that the
                    defendant left a set of keys to Unit 08 TC in the plaintiff’s
                    office. The plaintiff explained that this was done because Unit 08 TC
                    had been partitioned into two sub-units, one of which was still vacant; if the
                    defendant was unavailable to show potential tenants the vacant sub-unit, the
                    plaintiff could assist. The defendant, however, claimed that the plaintiff
                    wanted the keys to Unit 08 TC because the defendant had borrowed money
                    from the plaintiff. However, it would be very strange for an experienced
                    businessman like the plaintiff to keep, as security for an alleged loan, a set
                    of keys to the debtor’s property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In my view, all these claims were made to set
                    the stage for the defence of illegality. To me, the evidence showed a fairly
                    close friendship between the parties, albeit a business friendship, at the
                    material time. In fact, in February 2009, the defendant bought a 2-year
                    subscription for the software produced by the plaintiff’s company and
                    received a substantial discount for it. By this time, the April 2008 Option had
                    been thrice varied. This, to me, is not the behaviour of a devious, manipulative
                    moneylender on one hand and an oppressed debtor on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Finally, the defendant was generally evasive
                    on the stand and many parts of his testimony were incredible. I list five
                    examples below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant claims that he had
                        approached the plaintiff to “borrow” $240,000 merely because
                        he was in need and because the plaintiff was his neighbour. However, he says
                        that he had never discussed property investment with the plaintiff and did
                        not know if the plaintiff had any substantial savings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant surmises that the
                        plaintiff did not complete the purchase of Unit 08 TC under the
                        April 2008 Option because he felt guilty and afraid that the supposed
                        illegality of the transaction might be exposed. At the same time, the
                        defendant insists that each variation to the prevailing agreement between
                        the parties was more advantageous to the plaintiff than the defendant and
                        was foisted by the plaintiff on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     The defendant has failed to explain satisfactorily his
                        position that he approached the plaintiff for a second loan to repurchase
                        the KG Avenue Unit in 2010 despite thinking that the terms of the
                        April 2008 Option were oppressive to him and expecting the plaintiff to
                        impose terms that were less favourable to him than those offered by a
                        bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        defendant has also failed to give a satisfactory answer as to why he signed
                        the October 2010 Agreement if it was (as he said) meant to be a mere
                        proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        defendant says that, on each occasion he asked the plaintiff for a loan, he
                        did not state the terms which he proposed to the
                plaintiff.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Plaintiff’s Signature]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lim Beng Cheng, 11 Oct 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Whether the parties agreed to the terms of the October 2010
                Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The first issue is that of agreement. The
                    plaintiff’s point is simply that the October 2010 Agreement was freely
                    signed by the defendant and was meant to be a binding contract. The
                    defendant’s position is that the October 2010 Agreement was merely a
                    proposal prepared by the plaintiff which was never accepted by the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     To me, it is clear that a binding agreement
                    was formed on 11 October 2010. First, the language of the document suggests
                    that the October 2010 Agreement was intended to be a binding contract and not a
                    mere proposal. The concept of an agreement appeared three times in the language
                    of the document (“The <em>agreed</em>
                    settlement …”, “In view of this <em>agreement</em> …” and “… it is
                        <em>agreed</em> …”) whereas the
                    concept of a proposal was nowhere to be seen. Secondly, the parties signed the
                    document after spending an hour preparing it. If it was a mere proposal (as the
                    defendant says), signing it would make little sense. When the defendant was
                    asked why he signed it, he replied that there was an understanding that the
                    document was merely a proposal and that he signed it because the plaintiff asked
                    him to do so. The document was, in his words, a “non-binding
                    proposal”. In my view, his answer is unsatisfactory. At the time, the
                    defendant had much experience in executing transactions generally and obviously
                    understood the significance of signing a document. Further, it would be strange
                    for the defendant to wait an hour to sign a document that he says the plaintiff
                    had been preparing, if that document was merely a proposal. The
                    defendant’s argument that there was nothing wrong in parties recording the
                    terms of a proposal in writing misses the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendant makes four other arguments to
                    support his claim that a contract was never concluded on 11 October
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     First, the defendant argues that the proposed
                    terms of the October 2010 Agreement were so onerous and commercially insensible
                    that the defendant could not be taken to have agreed to them. Specifically, he
                    says that the plaintiff would acquire a share in the KG Avenue Unit
                    which he knew to be valued at $302,250 simply by forgiving the defendant’s
                    debt to the extent of $200,000, and that the defendant would be saddled with an
                    immediate financial burden because the balance debt of $79,352 was to be paid in
                    a lump sum and not in instalments. However, I struggle to find any commercial
                    insensibility of the kind that would make the plaintiff doubt whether the
                    defendant’s consent was genuine. Paying the $79,352 in a lump sum would
                    have freed the defendant from paying interest on instalment payments. If the
                    returns earned by the defendant on his investments were less than the interest
                    of 6% he was paying on the sum owed to the plaintiff, it would make sense to pay
                    the $79,352 in a lump sum rather than in instalments. In fact, the October 2010
                    Agreement would have improved the defendant’s medium-term liquidity
                    generally. It is perfectly conceivable that the share of the
                    KG Avenue Unit to be given to the plaintiff was calculated based on
                    its repurchase price rather than its then market price. By receiving an interest
                    in property instead of cash, the plaintiff would suffer a loss of liquidity and
                    the risks of ownership (<em>eg</em>, fluctuating property
                    prices) and it was only natural that he was compensated for it by receiving a
                    share of the KG Avenue Unit the market value of which exceeded his
                    notional investment. It should also be noted that as a part owner of the
                    KG Avenue Unit the plaintiff’s liquidity would have been subject
                    to more restrictions than those faced by sole owners of property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Next, the defendant argues that this agreement
                    was subject to NC Tan’s approval, which was never obtained. The
                    evidence does not support that argument. First, NC Tan was evidently not
                    intended to be party to the October 2010 Agreement; it neither required
                    NC Tan’s signature nor suggested that his approval was needed in any
                    way. Secondly, the plaintiff was told by the defendant that the defendant and
                    NC Tan had agreed to hold the KG Avenue Unit as tenants-in-common
                    in the respective shares of 97% and 3% and that the defendant alone could make
                    all the decisions regarding the KG Avenue Unit. Although the defendant
                    denies having made these representations, I think that the plaintiff’s
                    version of events should be believed. To my mind, the plaintiff would only have
                    entered the October 2010 Agreement if the defendant had assured him in some way
                    that the promises could be carried out. In the light of this, the reference to
                    NC Tan’s shareholding was merely additional information and, in my
                    view, both parties treated it as such when they signed the document on
                    11 October 2010. The defendant explained that he ought to consult
                    NC Tan because they were long-time business partners and because the terms
                    were onerous to NC Tan. That, as the plaintiff points out, is inconclusive.
                    NC Tan did not even state in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that there
                    was an agreement that restrained the defendant from dealing with the
                    latter’s own share in the KG Avenue Unit or that the defendant
                    required his consent to contract with the plaintiff on the unit. Even if the
                    defendant promised NC Tan separately not to alienate his own share in the
                    KG Avenue Unit, such a promise is <em>res inter
                        alios</em> and, as such, irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I draw an adverse inference against the
                    defendant on this point because NC Tan did not attend to testify despite
                    having filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief. The defendant’s claim that
                    NC Tan was present during the earlier tranches of the hearings is evidence
                    from the bar. Not much weight can be given to the defendant’s argument
                    that he himself was not cross-examined on NC Tan’s absence. I had
                    already questioned the defendant on NC Tan’s absence and there was
                    little point in allowing further cross-examination had it been requested by the
                    plaintiff’s counsel. No proper explanation was given as to why NC Tan
                    did not turn up. Nor did the defendant give evidence of any effort to procure
                    NC Tan’s attendance by the issue of a subpoena notwithstanding that
                    in a telephone conversation a few days prior to the hearing NC Tan had
                    informed him that he would not be turning up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Thirdly, the defendant points to three aspects
                    of the parties’ subsequent conduct and correspondence which he says show
                    that the October 2010 Agreement actually remained a proposal. None is
                    convincing. The defendant says he never paid the lump sum of $79,352 but
                    continued paying monthly instalments as if the April 2009 Variation was still in
                    force; this, he says, the plaintiff was aware of and acquiesced to. The fact of
                    continued instalment payments is neither here nor there. The plaintiff’s
                    explanation that he did not protest because the defendant promised to pay
                    $79,352 in a lump sum after he obtained a loan is plausible and was not tested
                    in cross-examination. Next, the defendant refers to the plaintiff’s letter
                    of demand dated 6 March 2013, which refers to the April 2009 Variation and
                    goes on to state: “It is also very absurd that you are still keeping the
                    $200,000, while still not willing to make the <em>transaction</em> …” The defendant also refers to
                    the plaintiff’s subsequent letter dated 29 March 2013 which he says
                    shows that the plaintiff was demanding the repayment of a <em>loan</em>. However, these references must be seen in context. The
                    6 March 2013 letter itself referred to an agreement to buy a 46.5% share of
                    the KG Avenue Unit from the defendant for a sum of $200,000 which was
                    handed to him on that day. These terms were only introduced in the October 2010
                    Agreement and the date stated (<em>ie</em>, 1 April
                    2009) was, in my view, correctly and candidly admitted to be a mistake on the
                    plaintiff’s part. The agreement was also impliedly said to be binding and
                    enforceable. The word “transaction” in that letter must mean the
                    defendant’s promise to transfer a 46.5% share in the
                    KG Avenue Unit. The plaintiff’s 29 March 2013 letter made
                    no reference to a loan; instead, it again referred to the payment of $200,000
                    for “the property”. Moreover, the letter of demand dated
                    23 October 2012 sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors referred to the
                    October 2010 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In fact, the parties’ subsequent conduct
                    actually suggests that the defendant’s position at trial is an
                    afterthought. From the time the letter of demand dated 23 October 2012 was
                    sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors to 7 May 2013, when the writ of
                    summons was issued, the defendant never once denied that he was under an
                    obligation to transfer a 46.5% share in the KG Avenue Unit to the
                    plaintiff. More importantly, the plaintiff had instructed his solicitors to
                    remove the caveat over Unit 08 TC on the very day that the October
                    2010 Agreement was signed. The defendant must have led him to think that they
                    were <em>ad idem</em> as regards the October 2010
                    Agreement. The defendant’s rationalisation that the plaintiff withdrew his
                    caveat in anticipation of the defendant’s agreement is strange if the
                    plaintiff was the devious and exploitative person the defendant makes him out to
                    have been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Finally, the defendant argues that he rejected
                    the plaintiff’s offer within a week. However, this argument cannot help
                    the defendant. The fact that he signed the October 2010 Agreement and the
                    plaintiff then authorised the withdrawal of his caveat over Unit 08 TC
                    on 11 October 2010 shows that, objectively, an agreement had been
                    concluded. Any purported rejection which came later was therefore irrelevant to
                    the question of acceptance. In any event, I think that the defendant was
                    untruthful in this regard. This claim is devoid of detail. He said only that he
                    rejected the offer via a phone call placed either within “the first
                    week” or “before November 2010”. If he did reject the
                    plaintiff’s offer, it is strange that he left no paper trail despite
                    having signed a document which, on its face, showed his unequivocal and
                    unconditional agreement. The fact that the plaintiff never re-lodged (or tried
                    to re-lodge) a caveat over Unit 08 TC on the grounds of the November
                    2008 Option to protect his interest is supportive of the plaintiff’s
                    position that the defendant had accepted, rather than rejected, the October 2010
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I conclude that the defendant accepted the
                    terms of the October 2010 Agreement and knew when he was signing it that it was
                    intended to be a contract, not merely a proposal requiring further
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether sufficient consideration moved from the plaintiff
                under the October 2010 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendant argues that the October 2010
                    Agreement is void for want of consideration. Although the defendant’s
                    closing submissions are unclear, he appears to suggest that the only
                    consideration moving from the plaintiff was the withdrawal of the April 2008
                    Caveat over Unit 08 TC, an act which he says the plaintiff was bound
                    to do in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I do not accept this argument. As the
                    plaintiff contended, there was valid consideration because the plaintiff
                    promised to release the defendant from the latter’s obligation to pay
                    $279,352 under the November 2008 Deed as varied by the April 2009 Variation
                    and because he promised to withdraw the April 2008 Caveat over
                    Unit 08 TC (even if the caveat had improperly remained on the
                    register). The former is quite clearly good consideration. As for the latter,
                    the forbearance to sue on a doubtful or even “clearly invalid”
                    claim is good consideration if there are reasonable grounds for the
                    promisor’s claim and if the promisor honestly believes he has a fair
                    chance of success (<em>Abdul Jalil bin Ahmad bin Talib v A
                        Formation Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 778 at [42]). This
                    principle applies to the plaintiff’s promise to withdraw the April 2008
                    Caveat. The plaintiff, strictly speaking, did not have a right to leave the
                    April 2008 Caveat on the register of titles, as that caveat claimed an interest
                    as purchaser in respect of a contract for sale dated 24 April 2008.
                    However, the plaintiff did not lodge a caveat following the November 2008
                    Option, even though he was entitled to do so, because the April 2008 Caveat had
                    not been discharged. The evidence suggests that the plaintiff believed in good
                    faith in October 2010 that he was entitled to maintain a caveat against
                    Unit 08 TC. It should also be noted that had the plaintiff not agreed
                    to withdraw the caveat, the defendant would have been put to expense and delay
                    in obtaining an order to effect its compulsory withdrawal. In the circumstances,
                    the plaintiff’s agreement to withdraw the April 2008 Caveat also conferred
                    a benefit on the defendant and should be considered good
                consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Whether the October 2010 Agreement is unenforceable by
                reason of illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The defendant takes the position that the
                    October 2010 Agreement is unenforceable because it is an illegal moneylending
                    contract under the Act and because it is illegal at common law. The issue of
                    illegality at common law can be easily disposed of. The plaintiff rightly points
                    out that the unenforceability of moneylending contracts is entirely the province
                    of statute and not common law; it is therefore unnecessary to discuss illegality
                    at common law. The discussion must focus on illegality under the Act. The
                    plaintiff takes the position that the transactions into which he entered were
                    not moneylending transactions and that he is not a moneylender in that he is an
                    excluded moneylender within s 2 of the Act and, in any event, he does not
                    carry on a business of moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     To begin, it is correct that a contract for a
                    loan granted by an unlicensed moneylender is unenforceable. However, under
                    s 2 of the Act certain categories of persons who carry on the business of
                    lending money are defined as “excluded moneylenders” and are
                    exempted from the requirement to obtain a moneylending licence under the Act.
                    Therefore, a loan contract entered into by a unlicensed but excluded moneylender
                    will be valid. The plaintiff’s position is that he is an “excluded
                    moneylender” because he falls within sub-para (<em>f</em>) of the definition of “excluded moneylender” in
                    the Act which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>f</em>)    any person carrying
                            on any business not having for its primary object the lending of money
                            in the course of which and for the purposes whereof he lends
                            money;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>Sheagar s/o
                        T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</em>
                    [2014] 3 SLR 524 (“<em>Sheagar</em>”), it was
                    stated by the Court of Appeal, albeit <em>obiter</em>, that
                    the alleged borrower bears the burden of proving that the alleged lender is
                        <em>not</em> an excluded moneylender (<em>Sheagar</em> at [40] and [67]–[73]). If the alleged
                    lender is an excluded moneylender, the rest of the statutory scheme is
                    inapplicable to him (<em>Sheagar</em> at [57] and [87]).
                    However, if the alleged lender is not an excluded moneylender, the borrower may
                    raise the presumption in s 3 of the Act that any person who makes a loan
                    which is to be repaid with interest is a moneylender until the contrary is
                    proved. This would shift the burden onto the lender to prove that he was
                        <em>not</em> carrying on the business of moneylending
                        (<em>Sheagar</em> at [38]–[39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The questions that need to be dealt with in
                    this part of the judgment are, first, whether the plaintiff did lend money to
                    the defendant and, if so, second, whether the plaintiff was an excluded
                    moneylender and, if not, third, whether the plaintiff carried on the business of
                    moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the plaintiff lent money to the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It is self-evident that a transaction must be
                    a loan to attract the operation of the Act in the first place. The defendant
                    argues that the underlying agreement (<em>ie</em>, the
                    April 2008 Option) was an ill-disguised loan of $240,000 carrying a liability to
                    pay interest of $100,000 and, accordingly, all the arrangements subsequent to
                    and flowing from it were also moneylending transactions. The plaintiff, by
                    addressing the issue of whether the April 2008 Option was a loan, seems to
                    accept that the nature of the April 2008 Option could “taint” the
                    nature of the October 2010 Agreement. However, he submits that the form of a
                    transaction <em>prima facie</em> reflects its substance; it
                    is only where both parties intended <em>not</em> to comply
                    with the transaction that the transaction will be said to be a sham. The April
                    2008 Option was not a sham; when exercised it was a sale contract with a
                    deferred right of completion subject to a repurchase option and the parties
                    treated it as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The law is clear on how the nature of
                    transactions should be analysed. The proper approach in determining the true
                    nature of a transaction is to look at the substance, as opposed to the form,
                    thereof (<em>E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout
                        Residence Pte Ltd</em> [2012] 1 SLR 32 (CA) (“<em>E C Investment</em>”) at [61]). This may
                    involve looking beyond the documents and divining the true agreement. The Court
                    of Appeal in <em>E C Investment</em> stated at
                    [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    We recognise that the court is not prohibited from
                            evaluating evidence <em>other than</em> the
                            transaction documents … to determine the true nature of a
                            transaction. In other words, the crux of the [issue of whether the
                            instruments were rightly regarded as a secured loan] lies not in
                            construing the wording or terms used in the [instruments] <em>per se</em>, but in determining whether the real
                            agreement between the parties was that expressed in those instruments.
                            If the parties had adopted the arrangement set out in the [instruments]
                            as a disguise for what was truly a loan, then their true intent, and not
                            the form of the [instruments], will prevail … [emphasis in
                            original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     However, the courts have emphasised that the
                    form of the transaction generally reflects the substance of that transaction.
                    There is a “very strong presumption that parties intend to be bound by
                    the provisions of agreements which they enter into” (<em>Chng Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock
                        Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye</em> [2013] 2 SLR 715 at [51]
                        <em>per</em> Chan Seng Onn J). Thus, in <em>Sheagar</em>, it was said that the court would look past the
                    form only when there is cogent evidence to suggest that it was a sham:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81    In our judgment, to come within the definition of
                            an “excluded moneylender”, both the letter and spirit of
                            the law must be complied with. We would emphasise, however, that in
                            most, if not all cases, the form of the transaction would <em>prima facie</em> reflect its substance. The
                            [Moneylenders Act] must not be seen by desperate defendants as a
                            “legal panacea” to stave off their financial woes.

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The fundamental error that underlies the defendants’ case on
                            both groups of cheques is that because they were, so they say, in need
                            of ready cash, and because the Plaintiff supplied them with it and made,
                            if he did, a profit out of doing so, therefore there was a loan and a
                            contract for its repayment. There are many ways of raising cash besides
                            borrowing. One is by selling book-debts and another by selling unmatured
                            bills, in each case for less than their face value. Another might be to
                            buy goods on credit or against a post-dated cheque and immediately sell
                            them in the market for cash. Their Lordships are, of course, aware, as
                            was Branson J., that transactions of this sort can easily be used
                            as a cloak for moneylending. <b>The task of the court in
                                such cases is clear. It must first look at the nature of the
                                transaction which the parties have agreed. If in form it is not a
                                loan, it is not to the point to say that its object was to raise
                                money for one of them or that the parties could have produced the
                                same result more conveniently by borrowing and lending money. But if
                                the court comes to the conclusion that the form of the transaction
                                is only a sham and that what the parties really agreed upon was a
                                loan</b> <b><em>which they
                                disguised</em></b><b>, for example, as a
                                discounting operation, then the court will call it by its real name

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In this case, the plaintiff was issued the
                    April 2008 Option in consideration of the payment of $240,000. This gave him an
                    option to purchase Unit 08 TC which could be exercised by delivering a
                    signed copy of the acceptance and paying a further $1 as deposit by 4pm on
                    24 April 2008. The purchase price of Unit 08 TC was $300,000. The
                    two most crucial (and unusual) clauses read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1a.    The Purchaser shall grant the Vendor Lim Ngee Sing
                            to buy back this Option from the Purchaser Lim Beng Cheng by returning
                            the option money paid plus an amount: $100,000/= (One Hundred Thousand
                            Only) by the date: 28 July 08, hereinafter called ‘Buy Back Expiry
                            Date’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1b.    If the vendor [<em>ie</em>,
                            the defendant] fails to buy back the option by the Buy Back Expiry Date
                                [<em>ie</em>, 28 July 2008], the Purchaser
                                [<em>ie</em>, the plaintiff] shall proceed to
                            complete the purchase and reserve the right to recover an addition of
                            the option money paid [<em>ie</em>, $240,000] and
                            an amount as stated on clause 1a [<em>ie</em>,
                            $100,000].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     An examination of the form and substance of
                    the transaction, the parties’ conduct and the surrounding circumstances
                    shows that the April 2008 Option was not a loan. First, the form of the
                    transaction was plainly that of an option/contract to purchase real property; in
                    form it was definitely not a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Next, I turn to the economic substance of the
                    April 2008 Option, an issue on which parties disagree. The defendant argues that
                    the transaction was a loan of $240,000 with an interest liability of $100,000.
                    He says that five features are unusual. First, the market price of
                    Unit 08 TC at the material time, which was $380,000, was far greater
                    than the purchase price of $300,000 stated in the April 2008 Option and the
                    option was therefore in substance security for the loan. Secondly, the option
                    price was $240,000 whereas options to purchase are normally priced at 1% of the
                    purchase price. Thirdly, there was a guaranteed gain of $100,000. Fourthly, if
                    the defendant did not exercise his buy-back right, then he was liable to pay the
                    plaintiff $340,000 <em>and</em> to sell
                    Unit 08 TC to the plaintiff for $300,000. Finally, the expiry date of
                    the option was the same as the date it was granted. The plaintiff criticises the
                    defendant’s characterisation as being a <em>post
                        facto</em> rationalisation. To him, the April 2008 Option was an
                    investment of $240,000 through which the plaintiff stood to enjoy a $100,000
                    profit or capital gain (out of a total of $400,000) that would arise when the
                    purchase of Unit 18 TC was completed. The buy-back right was unusual
                    but a similar instrument in <em>E C Investment</em>
                    was held not to be a loan. The $100,000 was simply the capital gain on an
                    investment. Further, the plaintiff was exposed to other investment risks.
                    Finally, there was no provision for interest past the three-month period during
                    which the defendant could exercise his buy-back option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In my view, the economic substance of the
                    April 2008 Option does not show that it was a loan rather than an
                    option/contract to purchase. As the plaintiff points out, the defendant’s
                    first three points can be answered by a study of <em>E C
                        Investment</em>. There, the defendant, RR, granted an option dated
                    5 June 2009 to the plaintiff, ECI, to purchase a piece of property (which
                    was valued at $23.2m) for $20m in consideration of an option fee of $1.5m.
                    A deed of settlement between the parties, executed on the same day but
                    post-dated to 8 June 2009, afforded the RR the right, “within 60
                    days from today”, to cancel the option by refunding the option fee of
                    $1.5m and paying an additional sum of $180,000. If this right was not exercised,
                    ECI would be entitled to exercise the option during the 30-day period
                    thereafter. ECI lodged a caveat claiming an interest as the holder of an option
                    and, following RR’s failure to exercise its cancellation right, a second
                    caveat claiming an interest as purchaser. The High Court held that this
                    transaction was in substance a secured loan of $1.5m at an interest of $180,000
                        (<em>E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence
                        Pte Ltd (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)</em> [2011] 2 SLR 232
                    (HC) (“<em>E C Investment (HC)</em>”) at
                    [71]–[90]). The Court of Appeal, disagreeing, stated that the nature of
                    the transaction was a genuine agreement for the sale of the property (<em>E C Investment</em> at [74]). Three of the court’s
                    findings are pertinent here. First, the fact that ECI hoped to achieve a gain
                    regardless of whether or not RR cancelled the option was merely regarded as a
                    “hard bargain” (<em>E C Investment</em>
                    at [71]; <em>E C Investment (HC)</em> at [30]).
                    Secondly, the cancellation right, far from suggesting that the option was not a
                    “true” option, was in fact evidence of the existence of the
                    option; the deferment period of ECI’s right to exercise the option
                    presumed the existence of the option (<em>E C
                        Investment</em> at [73]). Thirdly, the court found that the option was
                    a true option <em>despite</em> the fact that there was no
                    real negotiation on the purchase price; it was thought by the parties to be an
                    academic issue as the defendant’s sole shareholder-director was very
                    confident that he could exercise his cancellation right (<em>E C Investment</em> at [66]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Applying <em>E C
                        Investment</em> to the present case, it can be said that the
                    difference between the market price and purchase price, the unusually high
                    pricing of the option and the fact that the plaintiff was guaranteed a $100,000
                    gain do not <em>ipso facto</em> make the April 2008 Option
                    a loan. Conversely, the cancellation right as expressed in cll 1a and 1b of
                    the April 2008 Option suggests that it was a genuine option/contract to purchase
                    with a deferred right of completion that was subject to a repurchase of the
                    option by the grantor. This is consistent with cl 3, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The sale and purchase shall be completed within
                                <b>2 month</b> [<em>sic</em>] from the <b>Buy Back Expiry
                                Date</b> (“the Completion Date”) at the
                            Vendors’ solicitors’ office or at such other place as the
                            Vendors’ solicitors may on or before the Completion Date specify.
                            [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The issue of the cancellation right shades
                    into the defendant’s fourth point. The defendant argues that, on a true
                    interpretation of cl 1b, the plaintiff was entitled to complete the
                    purchase of Unit 08 TC <em>and</em> in addition
                    to that recover $340,000 from the defendant. I reject that argument. First,
                    while the grammar of cl 1b can accommodate the defendant’s
                    interpretation, I think that the plaintiff’s understanding (that he could
                        <em>either</em> complete the purchase of
                    Unit 08 TC <em>or</em> recover $340,000)
                    reflected the parties’ agreement at the time of contract. The discussions
                    preceding the contract showed that the defendant intended to pay the plaintiff
                    $340,000 by 28 July 2008, failing which the defendant would complete the
                    sale of Unit 08 TC at $300,000. It is hard to see how the defendant
                    would have agreed to a clause which required him to repay $340,000 over and
                    above selling Unit 08 TC for $300,000 if he did not exercise his right
                    to buy back Unit 08 TC. If this is correct, then the mechanism of this
                    transaction is almost identical to that in <em>E C
                        Investment</em> discussed above. The only difference (which is of no
                    help to the defendant) is that the option in <em>E C
                        Investment</em> had a deferred right of exercise whereas the
                    option/sale here had a deferred right of completion. Secondly, the
                    defendant’s interpretation of cl 1b is unfavourable to him as regards
                    the issue of whether the April 2008 Option was a loan, even though it seems to
                    portray the plaintiff in a negative light. If the defendant is correct, the
                    plaintiff would be <em>required</em> to complete the
                    purchase of Unit 18 TC. Such a transaction is more akin to an
                    investment than a loan because the plaintiff would be forced to bear the risks
                    and rewards flowing from the ownership of Unit 08 TC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The defendant’s fifth point, which is
                    that the expiry date of the April 2008 Option was the same as the date it was
                    granted, does not add anything at all to his argument. In sum, the substance of
                    the April 2008 Option does not show that it was a loan. For the purpose of
                    clarity, I should point out that although the parties referred to the April 2008
                    Option as an “option”, that was rather loose terminology. Legally,
                    the April 2008 Option was an option to purchase which developed into a sale and
                    purchase contract when the plaintiff exercised it on the day it was granted. The
                    unusual feature of the sale contract was the right given to the defendant to buy
                    back the property if he did so before the “Buy Back Expiry Date”.
                    Essentially, it was the defendant, not the plaintiff, who had an option to buy
                    Unit 08 TC after 24 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I now turn to the parties’ conduct and
                    the surrounding circumstances. First, at the material time, the plaintiff was a
                    businessman of 17 years’ standing. The defendant was a property agent and
                    property investor (perhaps “speculator” would be a more accurate
                    description) with a fair degree of financial sophistication. The parties should
                    be taken to know the effects of the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Secondly, on 24 April 2008, the parties
                    attended at the office of Mr Mak. The evidence, on balance, suggests that
                    either or both of the parties asked Mr Mak whether the transaction was in
                    order. The defendant claims that this was meant to give a semblance of
                    legitimacy to what was otherwise an illegal transaction. I cannot agree. As the
                    plaintiff points out, attending at Mr Mak’s office for legal advice
                    does not mean that the plaintiff was trying to circumvent the law. In fact, it
                    would be strange for a party wishing to circumvent the law to attend before a
                    lawyer. The fact that parties had legal advice was one of the reasons that the
                    transaction in <em>E C Investment</em> was held not to
                    be a loan (<em>E C Investment</em> at [67]). The Court
                    of Appeal also clarified that the mere fact that a party was thorough in
                    considering all the potential implications of a transaction was neutral and did
                    not indicate whether it was a disguised moneylending transaction or not
                        (<em>E C Investment</em> at [68]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Thirdly, on 28 April 2008, four days
                    after the April 2008 Option was exercised, a caveat was lodged by Mr Mak on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf, in which the plaintiff claimed an interest as
                        <em>purchaser</em>. This shows that the plaintiff
                    treated the April 2008 Option at face value. The defendant, however, takes issue
                    with the fact that stamp duty was never paid. He says that the parties never
                    intended for the plaintiff to actually complete the purchase of
                    Unit 08 TC and that the plaintiff did not expect the defendant to
                    actually allow the purchase to be completed. Crucially, he says that Mr Mak
                    knew from the outset that the sale would not happen and advised the plaintiff
                        <em>not</em> to pay stamp duty. The plaintiff, in fact,
                    faxed a letter dated 5 May 2008 to Mak &amp; Partners asking for the return
                    of a cheque for $4,200 and stating that he would bear the penalty for late
                    payment upon completion of the purchase. However, I accept the
                    plaintiff’s response that this conduct did not make the option any less
                    genuine. The fact that the plaintiff did not believe that the defendant was
                    willing to complete the sale of Unit 08 TC did not mean that the
                    plaintiff did not intend to buy it. Mr Mak said that there was no point
                    paying the stamp duty immediately as there was a buy-back clause in the option;
                    if the defendant did not buy the option back the plaintiff could pay stamp duty
                    at a later date with a small penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Fourthly, the defendant exercised his buy-back
                    right <em>in a modified way</em>, <em>ie</em>, by entering the July 2008 JVA. Under that agreement, the
                    defendant would be deemed to have paid $340,000 to cancel the April 2008 Option.
                    The relevant part of the agreement reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Amount $240,000 plus $100,000 totaling $340,000 (Singapore Dollars Three
                        Hundred Forty Thousand) be used by [the Defendant] to buy back Option dated
                        24 April 2008 (Property Address: 200 Jalan Sultan #08-07 Singapore
                        199018) from Mr Lim Beng Cheng …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The defendant, however, argues that the agreements entered
                        into after the April 2008 Option actually reveal the features of the loan
                        which were at first disguised. Specifically, he says that the July 2008 JVA,
                        the August 2008 Agreement and the November 2008 Deed provided for a
                        repayment plan specifying instalment amounts and interest rates. Even if
                        these subsequent agreements display features characteristic of loans, that
                        cannot change the fact that the parties abided by the terms of the April
                        2008 Option while it was in force. Further, I accept the plaintiff’s
                        evidence that each of these subsequent agreements were entered into at the
                        defendant’s behest. In so far as the defendant contends that it was
                        the plaintiff who forced him to enter these agreements, I do not believe
                        him. I have given my comments on the defendant’s general credibility
                        above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Further, the defendant did not try to disavow
                    any of the agreements until late 2012, when the letters of demand were sent
                    to him, despite claiming to have known that the transaction was illegal, as
                    early as the day <em>before</em> the April 2008 Option was
                    signed. The defendant explains that he is a man who keeps promises even if they
                    are unenforceable at law. This explanation, however, has been completely
                    undermined by the defendant’s vigorous root-and-branch attack on the
                    plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Finally, it is said by the defendant that the
                    fact that the plaintiff entered into the April 2008 Option because the promised
                    returns were more attractive than the fixed deposits in which the plaintiff had
                    been investing and that he would not have entered the transaction but for the
                    guaranteed gain of $100,000 showed that the April 2008 Option was a loan. This,
                    as the plaintiff rightly points out, is neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In conclusion, the form and substance of the
                    transaction, the conduct of the parties and the totality of the circumstances
                    strongly suggest that the April 2008 Option was not a loan. Accordingly, the
                    transactions flowing from it (including the October 2010 Agreement) are not
                    illegal under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the plaintiff was an excluded moneylender</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I go on to discuss the other issues that would
                    have arisen had I found that the April 2008 Option was a loan. I do this briefly
                    and for completeness only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The defendant relies on s 3 of the Act,
                    which operates to raise a presumption that the plaintiff was carrying on a
                    business of moneylending because he had disbursed $240,000 in consideration of
                    $340,000 being repaid. The plaintiff, however, argues that the defendant has
                    failed to discharge his burden of proving that the plaintiff is not an excluded
                    moneylender. I do not find much merit in the plaintiff’s argument. The
                    only limb of the definition of an “excluded moneylender” which
                    could possibly encompass the plaintiff is sub-para (<em>f</em>). This paragraph is meant to encompass persons who lend money
                    incidentally over the course of their business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There are no cases interpreting
                        sub-para (<em>f</em>) of the <em>current</em> definition of an “excluded moneylender”
                    but two older decisions are helpful. The first, <em>Premor Ltd v
                        Shaw Brothers (A Firm)</em> [1964] 1 WLR 978, explains the test that
                    must be satisfied. For a loan to be made “in the course of” a
                    business, it must be associated with a transaction of that business.
                    Additionally, for a loan to be made “for the purposes of” a
                    business, it must be made with the object of promoting that business. It was
                    insufficient that the loan kept a customer well-disposed towards the lender; the
                    purpose of the loan must be directly to help the business as distinct from, for
                    example, getting a high rate of interest. The plaintiff in this case ran a
                    hire-purchase finance company and it entered, in addition to <em>bona fide</em> hire-purchase transactions, certain “stocking
                    transactions” in which loans were made by the plaintiff to the
                    defendants, some purporting to be on the security of specified motor vehicles,
                    others mentioning no vehicle at all. However, it transpired that the documents
                    (which were <em>ex facie</em> unregistered bills of sale)
                    were entirely fictitious; they recorded purchase prices in respect of specified
                    motor cars, initial payments and storage charges which never existed. An issue
                    arose as to whether the plaintiff was not a moneylender because of
                        s 6(<em>d</em>) of the Moneylenders Act 1900 (63
                    &amp; 64 Vict, c 51) (UK) (“UK Act 1900”), which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The English Court of Appeal held that the loans were not made
                        “in the course of” the hire-purchase business as they were not
                        linked with any hire-purchase transaction at all. The loans were also not
                        made “for the purposes of” the business because they were made
                        to promote the success of the hire-purchase business but for the simple
                        purpose of earning a high rate of interest from customers who were prepared
                        to pay it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The second is a decision of the Privy Council
                    (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Colony of Singapore), <em>Official Assignee of the Property of Koh Hor Khoon and others,
                        bankrupts v Ek Liong Hin Ltd</em> [1960] 1 AC 178. The respondent
                    there, a Singapore-incorporated company, carried on as their primary business
                    that of rubber merchants and shippers. They made loans to selected customers on
                    the security of goods stored in godowns which they managed; these loans were
                    found to have been made to retain their existing customers and to gain fresh
                    ones. The court, applying these facts to s 2(<em>d</em>) of the Moneylending Ordinance (Cap 193, 1955 Rev Ed)
                    (which is <em>in pari materia</em> with
                        s 6(<em>d</em>) of the UK Act 1900), held that the
                    moneylending transactions were undertaken in the course of and for the purpose
                    of the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The evidence before me establishes that the
                    plaintiff did not lend money in the course of and for the purpose of a business
                    which did not have for its primary object the lending of money. If a loan was
                    extended, it was extended in the plaintiff’s personal capacity. The
                    plaintiff did not issue a cheque in the name of his company, and the $240,000
                    which was advanced to the defendant on 24 April 2008 came from the
                    plaintiff’s personal fixed deposit investments which he terminated. In any
                    case, the loan had nothing to do with the plaintiff’s business at all.
                    Accordingly, on the assumption that the April 2008 Option was a loan at
                    interest, the s 3 presumption would have been raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the plaintiff carried on a business of moneylending</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     On the assumption that the s 3
                    presumption has been raised, the next issue is whether the plaintiff carried on
                    a business of moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Belinda Ang Saw Ean J’s judgment in
                        <em>Mak Chik Lun v Loh Kim Her</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 338
                        (“<em>Mak Chik Lun</em>”) is instructive
                    on what it means to carry on a business of moneylending:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    … The local test of whether there is a
                            business of moneylending is whether there was a system and continuity in
                            the transactions. If no system or continuity is displayed, the
                            alternative test … of whether the alleged moneylender
                            is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that
                            they are from his point of view eligible is
                        used. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I generally agree with the plaintiff’s
                    submissions that neither of the tests set out in <em>Mak Chik
                        Lun</em> are satisfied in this case. First, there was no system and
                    continuity in the transactions. The plaintiff did not hold himself out as
                    carrying on the business of moneylending or, more generally, being willing to
                    lend money. Second, the plaintiff has been in the software development business
                    for over 20 years. The defendant did not seriously dispute the fact that the
                    plaintiff had a full-time business not connected with moneylending. Third, the
                    only known person with whom the plaintiff had any moneylending transactions in
                    his personal capacity was the defendant. There is no evidence to suggest that he
                    lent money on any other occasion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The defendant takes issue with certain payment
                    schedules the plaintiff produced. He says that the fact that these schedules
                    referred to “Loan Amount” and “Loan Period” is
                    evidence that the plaintiff was a moneylender with a systematic method of
                    keeping track of payments due to him. The plaintiff offered a perfectly
                    plausible explanation: these payment schedules were generated by software that
                    he had developed to help property agents calculate housing loans; the heading of
                    these payment schedules reads “Hiwire Data &amp; Security Pte
                    Ltd”, the name of the plaintiff’s company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I also agree with the plaintiff’s
                    submission that there was no evidence that he was willing to lend to all and
                    sundry. First, the plaintiff did not hold himself out as being willing to lend
                    money. It was the defendant who approached the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff
                    entered into the transaction on 24 April 2008 only because, among other
                    things, he had known the defendant for about nine months and regarded the
                    defendant as a neighbour and a good enough friend. Third, even the defendant
                    says that the plaintiff allegedly turned down a request for a second loan. The
                    defendant’s position that the plaintiff had mentioned, after the
                    transaction on 24 April 2008, that he could give other loans was never put
                    to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The defendant harps on the fact that a single
                    transaction with a single person can amount to moneylending and the fact that
                    the Act targets not just loansharking. He relies on the judgment of Lai Siu
                    Chiu JC in <em>Bhagwandas Naraindas v Brooks Exim Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 932 at [51], in which the Judge observed that
                    the test of system or continuity does not rule out the possibility that one
                    solitary transaction can, if the facts so justify, amount to a moneylending
                    transaction. No doubt the defendant is correct as a matter of principle.
                    However, that is merely the logical conclusion of the proposition that a
                    business of moneylending may be proved either by system or continuity in the
                    transactions or, failing that, by the fact that the alleged moneylender was
                    willing to lend to all and sundry provided they were from his point of view
                    eligible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I am satisfied that in this case neither test
                    was satisfied and therefore hold that the plaintiff did not carry on the
                    business of moneylending. Accordingly, the Agreements between the plaintiff and
                    the defendant would not, in any case, have been unenforceable by reason of
                    illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 4: Whether the October 2010 Agreement was void for
                uncertainty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The defendant makes a very brief claim that
                    “the various factual distortions on the face of the document
                    itself” makes the October 2010 Agreement void for uncertainty. This
                    argument is a non-starter. What must be certain in a contract are its terms and
                    not recitals of facts (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</em>
                    [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [50]). The terms of the October 2010 Agreement are clear.
                    The only term that could be relevant to this issue is the stipulation that the
                    plaintiff could lodge a caveat over either Unit 08 TC or
                    Unit 18 TC if the defendant did not complete the purchase of the
                    KG Avenue Unit. The plaintiff may not be able to do so as a matter of
                    law as he has no proprietary interest in either Unit 08 TC or
                    Unit 18 TC, but that is merely a secondary obligation, rather than the
                    main object of the agreement. The legal impossibility of fulfilling this
                    obligation cannot render the October 2010 Agreement void for
                uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the issues relating to liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     For the reasons given above, I hold that the
                    October 2010 Agreement is valid and enforceable and that the defendant is in
                    breach of contract since he has not transferred a 46.5% interest in the KG
                    Avenue Unit to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Remedies</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1A: Whether specific performance of the October 2010 Agreement
                should be ordered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The parties did not include arguments on
                    remedies in their first set of closing submissions. Subsequently, after a
                    request from me, they each filed further submissions addressing the point. The
                    defendant contends vigorously that if he is to be found liable, specific
                    performance should not be ordered on the basis that the plaintiff has come to
                    court with unclean hands, that the plaintiff was guilty of delay, that he
                    elected to receive damages in lieu of specific performance, and that the October
                    2010 Agreement provides an alternative to specific performance. In his
                    submissions, the plaintiff admits quite candidly that there are circumstances
                    which would weigh against specific performance even though he is pursuing and
                    willing to accept it should he succeed on the question of liability. He also
                    recognises that this remedy is at the discretion of the court and damages may be
                    awarded instead if in all the circumstances that is the just and equitable
                    course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Specific performance is a discretionary remedy
                    and the court will order it only if it is just and equitable to do so. The court
                    considers various factors, the foremost of which is whether damages are adequate
                        (<em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor</em> [2007] 3
                    SLR(R) 537 at [52]–[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Adequacy of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Traditionally, damages have been regarded as
                    an inadequate remedy for a breach of a contract for the sale of land. This is
                    generally premised on the uniqueness of land. The traditional position, however,
                    seems to have been diluted in recent years and it is now recognised that in some
                    situations damages would not only be adequate but the correct
                remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The first signs of dilution appeared in the
                    case of <em>Good Property Land Development Pte Ltd v Société
                        Générale</em> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 97 (“<em>Good
                        Property</em>”). The plaintiff there had mortgaged its hotel to
                    the defendant as security for a facility granted to it by the defendant.
                    Unfortunately, the plaintiff fell into arrears; this triggered the
                    defendant’s power of sale. The plaintiff then applied for an interim
                    injunction to restrain the defendant from completing a mortgagee sale of the
                    hotel to a third party (“HPL”) on the basis that the hotel was
                    being sold at an undervalue in bad faith. Chan Sek Keong J expressed the
                    view, albeit <em>obiter</em>, at [26] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    … <b>In circumstances where the main

                                damages would not be an adequate remedy to the owner for the loss of
                                the mortgaged property.</b> I am aware that there is high

                    at first instance refused specific performance. In Loh J’s view, the
                    hallmark of specific performance, as an equitable remedy, was <em>discretion</em>. The court would have to look at all the facts and
                    circumstances, including, importantly, the nature and function of the property
                    in relation to the purchaser. After a survey of authorities from Australia, New
                    Zealand and Canada, he stated that specific performance was not available as a
                    matter of course for a purchaser of land where the land was bought for
                    investment or financial gain. The judgment of Sopinka J in <em>Semelhago v Paramadevan</em> [1996] 2 SCR 415, a decision of
                    the Supreme Court of Canada (part of which was cited by Loh J), is worth
                    reproducing here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    … While at one time the common law
                            regarded every piece of real estate to be unique, with the progress of
                            modern real estate development this is no longer the case. Both
                            residential, business and industrial properties are mass produced much
                            in the same way as other consumer products. If a deal falls through for
                            one property, another is frequently, though not always, readily
                            available.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    Courts have tended,
                            however, to simply treat all real estate as being unique and to decree
                            specific performance unless there is some other reason for refusing
                            equitable relief. … Some courts, however, have begun to question
                            the assumption that damage will afford an inadequate remedy for breach
                            of contract for the purchase of land. … In <em>Chaulk v Fairview Construction Ltd</em> (1977) 14 Nfld. &amp;
                            P.E.I.R 13, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal (<em>per</em> Gushue J.A.) … stated, at
                            p 21:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The question here is, whether damages would have afforded Chaulk an
                            adequate remedy, and I have no doubt that they could, and would, have.
                            There was nothing whatever unique or irreplaceable about the houses and
                            lots bargained for. They were merely subdivision lots with houses, all
                            of the same general design, built on them, which the respondent was
                            purchasing for investment or re-sale purposes only. He had sold the
                            first two almost immediately at a profit, and intended to do the same
                            with the remainder. It would be quite different if we were dealing with
                            a house or houses which were of a particular architectural design, or
                            were situated in a particularly desirable location, but this was
                            certainly not the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Specific performance should, therefore, not be granted as a matter of
                        course absent evidence that the property is unique to the extent that its
                        substitute would not be readily available. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Thus, Loh J eventually held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    I am of the view that the law in Singapore should
                            follow the New Zealand and Canadian cases and has found expression,
                            albeit <em>obiter</em>, in the <em>Good Property Land Development</em> … and <em>Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd v LKM Investment Holdings Pte
                                Ltd</em> … cases referred to above. Just because the
                            contract involves the purchase of land, specific performance does not
                            follow as a matter of right. The court needs to look at all the facts
                            and circumstances. As [Robert J Sharpe, <em>Injunctions and Specific Performance</em> (Canada Law Book,
                            Looseleaf Ed, December 2009 release)] correctly puts it, land in the
                            hands of a speculator, is a fungible good. If all that matters is the
                            profit that the purchaser can make upon a resale, then damages must be
                            an adequate remedy. This is so even if the object is unique, be it a
                            piece of land, a piece of art or shares in a private limited company.
                            The traditional bases of personal enjoyment and that no two pieces of
                            land are identical, do not necessarily hold true for all purchasers and
                            in all cases. I do not think the court should only look at whether the
                            object of the purchase is unique or only at the reason for the purchase.
                                <b>The court should look at all the facts and
                                circumstances of the case, including importantly, the nature and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On the facts, Loh J found that the plaintiff, ECI, was a
                        property developer and, as such, did not purchase the property for personal
                        enjoyment; the property was simply another acquisition at an attractive
                        price. The fact that ECI was prepared <em>not</em> to
                        proceed with completion if the compensation offered to it was right made it
                        unrealistic to think that damages would not be an adequate remedy (<em>E C Investment (HC)</em> at [108]). The second
                        ground given by Loh J (which overlapped with the first) was that
                        damages were an adequate remedy in this case. The fourth ground, which also
                        seems to be related to the first two grounds, was that ECI was prepared not
                        to complete the purchase (<em>E C Investment
                            (HC)</em> at [115]). After the defendant failed to exercise its
                        cancellation right under the option, ECI had entered into two settlement
                        agreements, one after the other. Under each settlement agreement, the
                        plaintiff would allow the defendant to find another buyer for the property
                        and refrain from completing the purchase if a sum of money was given by a
                        certain date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    On appeal, Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering
                    the judgment of the Court of Appeal) reiterated at [103] that specific
                    performance was an equitable and discretionary remedy and the court had to, in
                    any event, consider all the circumstances to ensure that it was just and
                    equitable to grant the relief sought. He further stated that it was unnecessary
                    on the facts to rely on the restrictive approach to specific performance in
                    Canada and New Zealand to uphold Loh J’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Post-<em>E C
                        Investment</em>, the status of the more restrictive approach in Canada
                    and New Zealand in Singapore is not entirely clear. The Court of Appeal
                    certainly did not rule out the possibility that Singapore law may follow the
                    jurisprudence of Canada and New Zealand and it was careful not to express a
                    positive view either way on the preference shown by Chan J, Lee JC and
                    Loh J for the Canadian and New Zealand approach. From academic analysis of
                    Canadian decisions (see Robert J Sharpe, <em>Injunctions and
                        Specific Performance</em> (Canada Law Book, Looseleaf Ed, November
                    2014 release)), it appears that the Canadian authorities view uniqueness as a
                    matter of degree. Even where the purchaser’s interest is purely
                    commercial, an inquiry is undertaken as to whether the uniqueness of a property
                    makes an assessment of its income-producing qualities difficult. In my view, in
                    modern conditions of huge high-rise developments accompanied by a substantial
                    market for the acquisition of investment property, this is a more sensible and
                    nuanced approach than the unquestioning assumption underlying the traditional
                    English and Australian approach that land is unique such that damages will
                    almost invariably be an inadequate remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The equities in favour of the defendant in
                    this case are not as pronounced as those in <em>E C
                        Investment</em>. However, there is enough evidence to suggest that
                    damages are adequate to compensate the plaintiff here and that, accordingly,
                    specific performance should not be ordered whether or not the restrictive
                    approach in Canada and New Zealand is applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The plaintiff notes that one of the
                    considerations to be taken account of is whether the order for specific
                    performance can reasonably be enforced. He cited <em>Coastland
                        Properties Pte Ltd v Lim Geok Choo</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 890 where the
                    court refused to specifically enforce a contract of sale in which the property
                    was subject to a mortgage and although the sale price was lower than mortgage
                    amount neither the buyer nor the seller wanted to pay the shortfall. The court
                    took the view that forcing completion of the sale in these circumstances would
                    likely prejudice the mortgagee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The plaintiff also acknowledges that his
                    interest in the unit is primarily monetary in the form of an investment and from
                    that perspective damages should be an adequate remedy. Altogether the plaintiff
                    agrees that in the circumstances of this case damages in lieu of specific
                    performance may be the more equitable and practical remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    There are other points which indicate that
                    in this case the traditional remedy may be departed from. The
                    KG Avenue Unit is not a particularly unique piece of property. It is
                    one unit in a strata title development comprising many units. There are 30 units
                    on the same floor and in the same block, ten of which have an identical or
                    mirror-image layout <em>and</em> are located along the same
                    corridor. Further, it is not as if the plaintiff went out looking for an
                    investment property and selected the KG Unit because it met his investment
                    criteria – rather he became involved because the defendant asked him to
                    take an interest in it to replace part of the defendant’s debt. More
                    important than the features of the unit was the defendant’s ability to
                    acquire it at a good price thus giving the plaintiff value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The plaintiff also has the means to prove
                    the market value of the KG Avenue Unit with reasonable accuracy. He
                    prepared a chart which shows the average price per square foot at which private
                    properties in District 8 (like the KG Avenue Unit) have been
                    transacted. He is also aware of the factors which shift the value of units like
                    the KG Avenue Unit away from that average value. While it could be
                    argued that each unit in a block of flats is unique because there would be
                    differences between them even if only in the number of flights of steps one has
                    to take to reach them, such minute differences between units should not be
                    exaggerated. The difference in the view between two parcels of land should not
                    be regarded as the same as differences in “locality, character, vicinage,
                    soil, easements” or “the same precise conveniences and
                    accommodations” between two parcels of land (A E Randall, <em>Story’s Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence</em>
                    (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 1920) at p 314). The plaintiff has
                    indeed conceded that he places no subjective importance on the
                    KG Avenue Unit at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Thirdly, as the defendant submits, the
                    plaintiff has shown that he was, at some point in time, prepared to accept
                    monetary compensation if it was right. Between 6 March 2013 and 7 May
                    2013 (when he commenced this action), the plaintiff seemed to be prepared to
                    accept the payment of $200,000 as shown by his letters to the defendant dated
                    6 March 2013 and 29 March 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I think too, that the plaintiff has acted
                    correctly in accepting that an order of specific performance would be likely to
                    cause a little hardship to the defendant and NC Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Prejudice to third parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The plaintiff also concedes that it would be
                    impractical and difficult to expect the plaintiff and the defendant to be able
                    to co-operate fully and/or agree on management and investment decisions with
                    regards to the KG Avenue Unit as co-owners given their current
                    relationship. Secondly, NC Tan is also a co-owner and, according to the
                    defendant, he was not in favour of the defendant transferring a 46.5% interest
                    in the unit to the plaintiff. Ordering specific performance would, therefore,
                    force three hostile parties to work together and this would likely end up in
                    stalemate and further resort to the court to solve disagreements amongst them.
                    This is therefore another important factor in favour of not granting specific
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In the circumstances, there is no pressing
                    need to address the defendant’s arguments but I will do so briefly for
                    completeness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Clean hands</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The defendant asserts that the plaintiff has
                    come to court with unclean hands as his conduct shows that he was a
                    “shrewd calculative individual seeking to take unconscionable advantage
                    of” the defendant. In particular, he highlights the fact that the initial
                    loan was for $240,000 only and that the plaintiff refused to accept the cheque
                    tendered by the defendant for the balance of the principal sum. However, I
                    cannot see any merit in this submission. I have rejected the defendant’s
                    description of the plaintiff. Indeed, between the two men, the defendant was the
                    more calculating while the plaintiff, to a large extent, was accommodating to
                    the defendant’s requests and frequent changes of position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Even if the defendant has in mind the fact
                    that the 46.5% share in the KG Avenue Unit would be transferred at a
                    notional undervalue, I do not find that the plaintiff has come to court with
                    unclean hands. The third of five grounds given by Loh J for refusing
                    specific performance in <em>E C Investment (HC)</em>
                    is relevant here. He stated that the plaintiff there had come to court with
                    unclean hands (<em>E C Investment (HC)</em> at [114])
                    for three reasons. The first reason was that the plaintiff’s conduct
                    related to the equity sued for in the sense that the plaintiff was asking to
                    purchase the property at an undervalue (the purchase price stated on the option
                    had no relation to the then market value as the defendant’s sole
                    shareholder-director thought that he could exercise the cancellation right
                    therein). However, this was firmly rejected on appeal (<em>E C Investment</em> at [96]). The Court of Appeal stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96    We have … explained why we do not
                            share the Judge’s view that Ridout did not intend to grant to ECI
                            (via the First Option) a genuine option (although cancellable by Ridout
                            within the 60-Day Period) to purchase the Property. For the same
                            reasons, Ridout must be taken to have agreed to sell the Property to ECI
                            at the price of $20m. <b>It is not for the court to
                                review</b>, <b><em>ex post
                                facto</em></b><b>, the reasonableness of a
                                transaction freely concluded between (what are essentially) two
                                commercial entities. The court should not substitute its views on
                                commercial wisdom for those of the contracting parties, especially
                                in a case like the present where both parties</b> (<em>viz</em>, Anwar acting via Ridout, and KC Tan
                            and Poh acting via ECI) <b>are men of
                                business</b>. It must be borne in mind that the property
                            market at the material time was very much affected by the unprecedented
                            global financial collapse. The real effects of that financial collapse
                            on the Singapore property market were not something which any person
                            could reasonably predict at that time. <b>We should not
                                use the benefit of hindsight to determine the wisdom of the
                                Transaction.</b> Perhaps because of the then uncertainty in
                            the property market, ECI acted cautiously (by offering a low price for
                            the Property); or, alternatively, knowing of Anwar’s financial
                            desperation, ECI tried to “squeeze” him, which was what
                            the Judge thought was the case (see [30] of the Judgment). <b>Whatever might have been the case, ECI’s conduct in
                                driving down the purchase price of the Property as much as it could
                                was neither legally improper nor unconscionable. Thus, on the
                                question of the low purchase price of the Property alone, there is,
                                in our view, nothing “unclean” on that account in ECI
                                seeking to enforce the Sale Agreement. We would reiterate that both
                                parties were represented in the Transaction by
                                solicitors.</b> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In this case, both parties were financially sophisticated
                        enough to appreciate the transaction into which they were entering,
                        including the fact that the price of Unit 08 TC as stated in the
                        April 2008 Option bore little relation to its then market value. In fact, it
                        should be noted that the defendant here, much like the defendant’s
                        sole shareholder-director in <em>E C
                            Investment</em>, was very confident that he could exercise his
                        cancellation right and that it was the defendant who, at the last minute,
                        raised the purchase price from $240,000 to $300,000. In my view, the fact
                        that this transaction was entered into between two parties in their personal
                        capacities and that the parties did not obtain formal legal advice is also
                        not a good enough reason for the court to substitute its views on the
                        transaction for that of the parties’. The quantum involved in this
                        transaction was small enough for parties not to seek any additional and
                        specific legal advice. Accordingly, the “clean hands” factor
                        is in my view a neutral one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Delay and/or laches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The defendant argues that specific
                    performance should also be refused on the ground of laches on the basis that the
                    plaintiff has come to court long after the October 2010 Agreement had been
                    entered into. This argument is obviously wrong as a matter of law. The relevant
                    time is not when a contract was entered into but when the plaintiff should have
                    been reasonably aware of the facts constituting the breach of contract. In this
                    case, it should have been 1 January 2012 when the defendant repudiated the
                    October 2010 Agreement and, in any event, it must have been <em>after</em> 8 November 2011, the date on which the resale of the
                    KG Avenue Unit to the defendant was completed. The defendant’s
                    reliance on <em>Toh Tiong Huat v P M Gunasaykaran (personal
                        representative of the estate of Mayandi s/o Sinnathevar, deceased) and
                        another</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 627 does not help him since the facts
                    were different. There, Lai Siu Chiu J refused specific
                    performance on the ground of an unexplained 18-month delay during which the
                    plaintiff did nothing. Conversely, the time between repudiation and the
                    institution of legal proceedings in the present case was not only shorter but
                    also saw a number of demands made by the plaintiff (or his solicitors) on the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the October 2010 Agreement provides for damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The defendant also argues that the October
                    2010 Agreement provides that “In case of any failure to complete the
                    [KG Avenue Unit], the outstanding amount of $200,000 owned by LNS to
                    LBC can be used to caveat” either Unit 08 TC or
                    Unit 18 TC and, therefore, it could not be construed that the parties
                    intended the plaintiff to have a right of specific performance. This argument
                    cannot work for two main reasons. First, I interpret the “failure to
                    complete” to mean the failure to complete the sale from the
                    defendant’s ex-tenant to him (and not the transfer of a 46.5% share to the
                    plaintiff). This is reinforced by the fact that the parties intended the
                    plaintiff to lodge a caveat against either Unit 08 TC or
                    Unit 18 TC but not the KG Avenue Unit should completion not take
                    place. In my view, the parties contemplated that if there was a “failure
                    to complete”, the defendant would not have had an interest in the
                    KG Avenue Unit as the proprietor. This part of the contract did not provide
                    the defendant with alternative modes of performance; it was a condition
                    precedent to the defendant’s obligation to transfer a 46.5% share in the
                    KG Avenue Unit to the plaintiff which was, in the event, fulfilled. Second,
                    the court’s discretion to grant specific performance cannot be fettered by
                    any contractual agreement to the contrary (<em>Tay Ah Poon v
                        Chionh Hai Guan</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 596 at [17] <em>per</em> M Karthigesu JA).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Finally, the defendant argues that the
                    plaintiff is accordingly precluded from claiming specific performance after
                    having elected to claim the return of $200,000 in his e-mails dated 6 March
                    2013 and 29 March 2013. In my view, these e-mails are not to be viewed as
                    elections. Although the plaintiff demanded the return of $200,000, his e-mail
                    dated 6 March 2013 showed his intention to sue “for failure to
                    honour the agreement as well as for the return of the amount $200,000 plus
                    losses”. This court action was referred to in the 29 March 2013
                    e-mail again. To my mind, the plaintiff was at the end of his tether and
                    prepared to settle the matter if the defendant quickly returned the $200,000.
                    The letter which had been sent by his solicitors earlier did in fact demand
                    specific performance of the October 2010 Agreement. This situation is quite
                    different from one where an innocent party makes an unequivocal election to
                    accept a repudiation and sue for damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on whether specific performance should be
                granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    On the basis that damages are an adequate
                    remedy and that an order of specific performance would lead to a stalemate
                    between three hostile parties, I order damages in lieu of specific
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1B: If damages in lieu of specific performance are ordered,
                what should be the date at which the KG Avenue Unit is valued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The plaintiff submits that the damages
                    should be assessed as at the date of judgment. He relies on the opinion of
                    Megarry J in <em>Wroth v Tyler</em> [1974] 2 WLR 405
                    at 430 that damages to be awarded in lieu of specific performance should be
                    assessed at the date of judgment to reflect the fact that specific performance
                    is a continuing remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Although the general rule is that damages
                    are assessed as at the time of breach, this is not an inflexible rule. Thus, it
                    was stated by Lord Wilberforce in <em>Johnson v Agnew</em>
                    [1980] AC 367 at 400 that if to follow it would give rise to injustice, the
                    court has the power to fix such other date as may be appropriate in the
                    circumstances. His Lordship further observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>In cases where a breach of a contract for sale has
                            occurred, and the innocent party reasonably continues to try to have the

                            just</b> rather than to tie him to the date of the original
                        breach, <b>to assess damages as at the date when</b>
                        (otherwise than by his default) <b>the contract is
                            lost.</b> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    This passage was cited with approval by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Tay Joo Sing v Ku Yu Sang</em>
                    [1994] 1 SLR(R) 765. At [37], M Karthigesu JA observed that the key
                    issue was whether the innocent party “ought to have mitigated his loss in
                    the circumstances.” It would be fair to say that an innocent buyer in a
                    contract for the sale of land, being <em>generally</em>
                    entitled to specific performance, is not expected to mitigate his loss if he is
                    pursuing specific performance. Put another way, the reasoning that damages
                    should be assessed as at the date of breach because the innocent purchaser can
                    purchase a replacement from the market on the date of the breach does not hold
                    true for contracts for the sale of unique goods where specific performance is a
                    possible (and, in fact, desired) remedy. Thus, where damages are awarded in lieu
                    of specific performance, the principle that damages should be assessed as at the
                    date of the breach do not normally apply; a buyer’s entitlement to such
                    damages should be assessed from the date that specific performance is no longer
                    available.</p>

                    position, the sellers failed to complete the sale of a property. On the first
                    day of trial, the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which the
                    buyers abandoned their claim for specific performance and prayed for damages
                    instead. The sole issue faced by the court was that of quantum. Lee JC
                    thought that assessing damages as at the date of the breach would place an
                    innocent buyer in an invidious position. He explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    Mr Sreenivasan’s first submission is
                            that damages should be assessed as of the date of breach which in the
                            present case is the contractual date of completion, <em>viz</em> 29 June 1999. He cited several authorities in
                            support of this proposition, to which I will turn later. But it seems to
                            me that apart from authority, <b>if this be the law,
                                then the right given to the innocent party to seek specific
                                performance would be worthless. If the innocent party were required
                                to mitigate his damages from the time of breach he would in effect
                                be confined to seeking his remedy in damages.</b> I shall
                            illustrate this with the following example. X enters into a contract to
                            purchase a property from Y. On the date of contract, X had taken the
                            view that the property will rise in value. Y fails to complete on the
                            contractual completion date. X decides to sue for specific performance.
                            In a situation where damages, if awarded in lieu of specific
                            performance, are assessed at the time of breach then X, having taken the
                            view that the market is on the rise, would have to go into the market
                            and purchase an equivalent property. But should X succeed in obtaining
                            an order for specific performance and Y then completes the transaction,
                            X would be saddled with 2 properties. This is all very well if the
                            market has moved up. But if it moved down instead, it would have doubled
                            his losses in a situation where he had bargained for only half the
                            exposure. The other reason why the right would be futile is a practical
                            one. X would have paid to Y a deposit of about 10% of the purchase
                            price. If X seeks an order for specific performance, he is not entitled
                            to ask for the refund of this deposit. Without that money he is not
                            likely to be able to purchase another property to mitigate his damages.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On the facts, Lee JC held that the date of assessment of
                        damages was the date on which the buyers lost their right to specific
                        performance, <em>ie</em>, the date on which they
                        elected for damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In the present case, assessing damages based
                    on the current value of the KG Avenue Unit would best reflect the
                    plaintiff’s true loss. Assessing the value of the KG Avenue Unit
                    based on its historical value would, while protecting the plaintiff against any
                    subsequent decrease in the value of the KG Avenue Unit, also deny him
                    the benefit of any subsequent appreciation in the value of the
                    KG Avenue Unit. In fact, it was precisely because of the appreciation
                    in the value of the KG Avenue Unit that the plaintiff was so insistent
                    on having the contract specifically performed. I see no good reason why damages
                    should be assessed as at the date of the breach instead. I have already stated
                    my view that the defendant cannot argue that the plaintiff has brought this
                    action late. It is quite clear from the correspondence that the plaintiff has
                    given the defendant many chances to honour his promise. I have also stated my
                    view that the plaintiff’s e-mails of 6 March 2013 and 29 March
                    2013 did not amount to an election to accept the repudiation. The
                    defendant’s argument that the plaintiff did not contribute directly to the
                    purchase of the KG Avenue Unit is hardly relevant. In the
                    circumstances, I am of the view that damages in lieu of assessment should be
                    assessed as at the date of judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether damages or account of profits for the loss of use of
                the KG Avenue Unit should be awarded</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The plaintiff has also claimed damages for
                    the loss of use of the KG Avenue Unit. By reason of the
                    defendant’s breach, the plaintiff did not enjoy the rental income which he
                    would otherwise have enjoyed. The unit has been an income-earning unit since
                    purchase and since the plaintiff should have been a co-owner he is entitled to
                    an equivalent share of the net income of the unit. The quantum should be 46.5%
                    of the net profits from the uses to which the KG Avenue Unit has been
                    put. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the tenants-in-common of the
                    KG Avenue Unit must be presumed to have intended to share the profits
                    in the proportions of their respective shares in the
                    KG Avenue Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The plaintiff has claimed damages from
                    1 December 2011 onwards even though the defendant’s repurchase of the
                    KG Avenue Unit was completed on 8 November 2011.The defendant has
                    not given any evidence to contradict the assumption that rental income accrued
                    from 1 December 2011. That, however, is a matter that can be dealt with on
                    assessment. On assessment, any money which the defendant paid the plaintiff
                    after the sum of $79,352 had been settled and in purported settlement of part of
                    the remaining $200,000 can be deducted from the plaintiff’s profit share
                    and other damages. Secondly, the plaintiff, in his statement of claim, claims
                    damages in respect of the loss of use of the KG Avenue Unit from
                    1 December 2011 “to date”. This should be read as the date of
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Whether a sale of the KG Avenue Unit should be
                ordered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Since I am awarding the plaintiff damages in
                    lieu of specific performance, an order for the sale of the
                    KG Avenue Unit would not be appropriate; the plaintiff has no
                    proprietary interest in it. A second reason is that a sale of the
                    KG Avenue Unit will prejudice the rights of NC Tan, who holds a
                    3% stake in the KG Avenue Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    For the reasons given above there will be
                    judgment for the plaintiff for damages to be assessed (in accordance with the
                    guidelines above), interest from the date of judgment and/or assessment (as
                    decided at the assessment) and costs.</p>
