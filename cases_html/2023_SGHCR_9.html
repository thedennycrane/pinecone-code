This in turn is notedly connected to other prayers in the Statement of Claim. There is therefore a strong suggestion and reason to believe that the financial statements as drawn up by the Company and management may not be providing a true and fair view of the Company’s financial position as at the valuation date and this in turn will certainly impact on the engagement objective of determining the proper valuation of your clients’ minority stake as the valuation date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 RIC argued that, based on the paragraph above, the purpose of seeking the General Ledgers was to challenge the veracity of RIC’s Financial Statements and not to determine whether the shares of RIC were obtained by POP Holdings at an undervalue.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having noted that the valuation of [H8 Holdings’] minority shareholding is at the valuation date, we note that as against this, the financial statements are all dated as at 31 December. For a meaningful valuation to be conducted, it is important that the financial statement and financial information (including the management accounts) as at 30 June 2018 are in hand. This includes the entire detailed General Ledgers of [RIC] for the financial years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 which would cover the transactions up to and including 30 June 2018. The General Ledgers for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 would explain the closing balances as at 31 December 2017 and consequently the opening balances for 31 December 2018. The General Ledgers would also allow the 26 June 2018 and/or 30 June 2018 management accounts to be reconstituted and provide insight into how transactions are recorded especially for sales. The General Ledgers from July 2018 to 31 December 2019 would provide insight into what transactions took place after [H8 Holdings’] shares were diluted and in particular, whether any specific actions, resolutions or other transactions of [RIC] were carried out, put in place or timed after the dilution took place. Also, the importance of having the General Ledgers for the financial years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2019 in hand is connected to the issue of the veracity of the financial statements for these financial periods. This is elaborated on below and in particular at paragraph 8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In contrast, RIC did not put forth any evidence showing why it would be incorrect for Mr Mann to choose to rely on the General Ledgers in his valuation. Instead, RIC’s argument is simply that Mr Mann had not explained how the General Ledgers would be relevant to the valuation, which I did not agree with. In my view, the reasons provided by Mr Mann as set out at paragraph 6 of his letter showed that the General Ledgers would assist Mr Mann in understanding the financial accounts and assessing the financial position of RIC, which would be relevant to the valuation of the Shares. As to whether the Financial Statements and Management Accounts would be sufficient for the purpose of the valuation, this is a question of necessity, which will be dealt with below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Having considered the relevance of the General Ledgers, I returned to RIC’s argument that the General Ledgers are intended to be relied upon to challenge the accuracy and veracity of RIC’s Financial Statements, which RIC says is an issue that has neither been pleaded nor challenged by H8 Holdings. This appeared to have arisen from paragraph 8 of Mr Mann’s Letter which has been reproduced at [17] above, as well as the second last sentence of paragraph 6 of Mr Mann’s Letter which stated:

RIC argued that the 2019 Ledgers were irrelevant as the issue in question related to the value of RIC’s shares as of 26 June 2018. In RIC’s view, transactions which took place after 26 June 2018 had no impact on or relevance to the value of the Shares as at 26 June 2018 and that the request for the 2019 Ledgers was a fishing expedition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In response, H8 Holdings submitted that the 2019 Ledgers were relevant as the valuation process was not a point valuation but an ongoing one. Being an ongoing valuation, Mr Mann would need to take into account subsequent transactions so as to get an accurate picture of the financial status of RIC and consequently provide a more accurate valuation of the Shares as at 26 June 2018. In support of its argument, H8 Holdings referred to paragraph 6 of Mr Mann’s Letter which stated:

To do so, it was fair for Mr Mann to seek documents which he believed would assist him in providing an accurate and meaningful valuation that would assist the Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In Mr Mann’s view, the Disclosed Documents were insufficient for him to provide a meaningful or accurate valuation of the Shares. This is because the Financial Statements were unaudited and the Statement of Claim sought an independent audit of RIC’s financial accounts to be conducted to determine if RIC was a going concern. Given these, Mr Mann believed that he may not have a full view of the financial position of RIC with only the Disclosed Documents, therefore making it difficult for him to provide an accurate and proper valuation of the Shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In view of the concerns that Mr Mann had arising out of the circumstances and pleadings of the parties, I was of the view that it was fair and necessary for Mr Mann to have sight of the General Ledgers to satisfy himself that he had the full picture of RIC’s financial position, which would in turn assist him in providing a valuation to the Court that he believes is accurate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">H8 Holdings’ expert is not bound to rely solely on material that the Defendant’s expert chooses to rely on</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 RIC also argued that the General Ledgers were unnecessary as the Defendants’ expert, Mr Reid, would not be relying on them in his valuation of the Shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This argument is without merit. However, in fairness to RIC, this argument arose because Mr Mann took issue with Mr Reid (being the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants’ expert) having been given unfettered access to RIC’s financial information including the General Ledgers whereas he was not similarly given the same. Mr Mann took the view that the unequal access to information could leave his valuation report open to attack by Mr Reid and affect the credibility and weight of his report.

</div> There was no evidence before me that Mr Reid has stated that he has chosen not to rely on the General Ledgers. Even if he did state so, Mr Reid could still change his mind subsequently and choose to rely on the General Ledgers, which RIC’s counsel accepted. Accordingly, I do not agree that the General Ledgers are unnecessary simply because (and assuming that to be the case) Mr Reid had, for the moment, chosen not to rely on them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">No inordinate delay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 RIC also objected to the Application on the basis that there was substantial delay. In this regard, RIC argued that the issue of undervalue crystallised as early as 3 January 2023. Yet, H8 Holdings only issued substantive instructions to Mr Mann on 24 May 2023 and only took out the Application on 7 June 2023. As a result, RIC claimed that it had to incur additional costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I did not agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First, as counsel for RIC rightly conceded, delay <span class="font-italic">per se</span> is not a bar to an application for specific discovery. The key is whether the General Ledgers are relevant and necessary to determine the value of the Shares which, for the reasons set out at [13] to [39] above, I had found to be so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, and in any event, I was not convinced that there was inordinate delay.

Once that was sorted out on 23 May 2023, and RIC had refused H8 Holdings’ request for the General Ledgers, H8 Holdings took out the Application 2 days from RIC’s refusal. The entire exchange from the time discussions began on the possibility of appointing a joint expert to the time the Application was filed took less than a month. This, in my view, did not amount to inordinate delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Even if I considered the time taken from the point when the issue of whether the shares were obtained by POP Holdings at an undervalue crystallised, which was in January 2023, I did not think that a delay of about 6 months should bar the Application. Counsel for RIC rightly conceded that it would be difficult for him to press this point further on the present facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Commercial sensitivity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As a final string to its bow, RIC argued that the General Ledgers should nevertheless not be disclosed as they contained commercially sensitive information. RIC submitted that this information could be used by certain representatives of H8 Holdings in another company that they were allegedly involved in, Joylicious Management Pte Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Joylicious</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Management</span>”), to the detriment of RIC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In the interest of saving time and costs, I directed counsel for both parties to consider whether agreement could be reached on the scope of disclosure of the General Ledgers with the appropriate redactions. However, as parties were unable to reach an agreement on the scope of disclosure, I proceeded to consider the extent to which the General Ledgers should be disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on disclosure and the interest in protecting commercially sensitive information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is generally accepted that parties should have unfettered access to all relevant and necessary documents to ensure a fair trial. At the same time, it is well-established that there is a need to ensure that documents that a party is compelled to disclose for the purposes of the proceedings are not misused by the party receiving the document (see <span class="font-italic">B2C2 Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Quoine Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2018] 4 SLR 67 at [16]; see also <span class="font-italic">Genk Capital Pte Ltd v Zhang </span><span class="font-italic">Changjie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2020] SGHCR 4 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Genk Capital</span>”)<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>at [9]). To strike the appropriate balance, the Courts rely on the <span class="font-italic">Riddick </span>principle or undertaking – that documents disclosed in discovery under compulsion must not be used for any purpose other than the action in which they are produced: <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hoa</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2021] 2 SLR 584 at [100].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, the <span class="font-italic">Riddick </span>principle may not always be sufficient. Concerns remain in the minds of trade rivals or competitors locked in proceedings that documents that they disclose may contain commercially valuable or sensitive information such as customer names, price lists and data which may not be sufficiently protected by the <span class="font-italic">Riddick </span>undertaking. The reason for such concerns is a practical one. Once the documents containing commercially sensitive information have been seen, they cannot be unseen. Realistically, it would be difficult or impossible for a trade rival to segregate, in his mind, the information obtained through discovery from the information that he already has from being in the industry. There may be overlaps in both sets of information and it would be unfair for the receiving party to be prevented from pursuing businesses that he could have engaged in based on his prior knowledge, just because the same information was also disclosed in the course of proceedings. Practically, it would also be difficult for the disclosing party to enforce the <span class="font-italic">Riddick </span>undertaking as it may not be clear whether the information obtained through discovery was in fact used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The interest in protecting commercially sensitive information and the reality that the <span class="font-italic">Riddick </span>principle may be inadequate in such situations find support in the case of <span class="font-italic">Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Guina Developments Pty Ltd </span>(1995)<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>33 IPR 82. In that case, Hayne JA delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria and said at pp 87-89: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where it is said that the documents are confidential, it may be accepted that the fact that the documents are confidential will not ordinarily be a sufficient reason to deny inspection by the opposite party. In most cases, the fact that the documents may not be used except for the purposes of the litigation concerned will be sufficient protection to the party producing them. But where, as here, the party obtaining discovery is a trade rival of the person whose secrets it is proposed should be revealed by discovery and inspection, other considerations arise.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Once the documents are inspected by the principals of the trade rival the information which is revealed is known to the trade rival and cannot be forgotten. Confidentiality is destroyed once and for all (at least so far as the particular trade rival is concerned). To say that the trade rival is bound not to use the documents except for the purposes of the action concerned is, in a case such as this, to impose upon that trade rival an obligation that is impossible of performance by him and impossible of enforcement by the party whose secrets have been revealed. How is the trade rival to forget what internal rate of return the competitor seeks to achieve on a new investment of the kind in question? How is the party whose hurdle rate has been revealed to know whether the rival has used the information in framing a tender? Thus, if the trade rival may inspect the documents concerned, the confidentiality of the information in them is at once destroyed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The question is then this: when should a party be allowed to refuse disclosure of relevant material on the basis that they contain commercially sensitive information? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law and methods of protecting commercially sensitive information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Generally, the mere fact that a document is confidential or commercially sensitive does not preclude the document from being subject to discovery and disclosure (see Jeffrey Pinsler S.C., <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice </span>(LexisNexis, 2020) at [24/9/1]) (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span>”)). If the document is relevant and necessary, subject to claims of privilege or immunity, the document should be disclosed (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span> at [24/9/1]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It follows that mere allegations of commercial sensitivity are insufficient for a party to refuse disclosure: <span class="font-italic">Cigar Affair v Pacific Cigar Co</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 633 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cigar Affair</span>”) at [34]. If that was not the case, litigants could simply make unsupported allegations that documents sought should not be disclosed because they contain commercially sensitive information, notwithstanding their relevance to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I pause here to acknowledge that <span class="font-italic">Cigar Affair</span> was not a case involving a civil case on discovery of documents but one that related to the seizure of documents pursuant to search warrants under the Trade Marks Act 1998 (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed). Nevertheless, the general proposition that mere allegations of sensitivity should not <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>disallow access to documents which are otherwise relevant, should be equally applicable in the context of civil discovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my view, the onus is on the party claiming that the information in the document sought to be disclosed is commercially sensitive to show that the degree of commercial sensitivity or the impact of its disclosure would justify its exclusion from discovery notwithstanding its relevance and necessity to the proceedings. At the minimum, the party should set out (a) what in the document is commercially sensitive, (b) how the information is commercially sensitive, and (c) how the document, if disclosed to the other party, would cause prejudice to the disclosing party. If the Court is satisfied that the document contains commercially sensitive information <span class="font-italic">and</span> should be protected, the Court may limit the scope of disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this regard, there are various ways that the scope of disclosure may be limited. Without setting out an exhaustive list of methods, the scope of disclosure of commercially sensitive documents may be limited by:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) redacting (or replacing with anonymised terms) the portions that are commercially sensitive (see <span class="font-italic">IDB Interactive </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Online E-Club Management Sdn Bhd</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2020] 7 MLJ 349 at [48]); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) allowing access to the document to only specific individuals (also known as “confidentiality clubs” or “confidentiality rings”) (see <span class="font-italic">Genk Capital</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>([54] above) at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Redaction is one of the most straightforward methods of limiting disclosure. Portions that a party claims to be commercially sensitive can be redacted so that the receiving party is still given access to the relevant document while ensuring that the disclosing party is not prejudiced by the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. In adopting this course, it is not unusual for the Court to first review the unredacted version of the document in the absence of the receiving party to consider the disclosing party’s proposed redactions. This is particularly the case when there are disputes as to whether the disclosing party is indeed redacting commercially sensitive information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There may also be situations where the redaction of commercially sensitive information could leave gaps in the document making it difficult for the receiving party to make sense of the unredacted information. For example, where the document to be disclosed is the accounts of a company and the names of customers have been redacted, the receiving party may not be able to know whether certain transactions are attributed to the same customer. In those situations, where the names of customers are not critical to the proceedings, the redacted portions may be replaced with anonymised terms (for example, Customer A, Customer B) so that the receiving party is still able to meaningfully rely on the document. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Where, however, the information sought to be redacted or replaced is critical to the proceedings, redaction or anonymising the commercially sensitive information may not be feasible. In such situations, the Courts have considered ordering that the document be disclosed only to certain individuals (for example, to a party’s legal advisors or experts) (also known as “confidentiality clubs” or “confidentiality rings”) often with a confidentiality undertaking from these individuals not to disclose the document or information contained therein to individuals outside of the clubs or rings (see <span class="font-italic">Genk Capital</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([54] above)<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>at [11]). Once proceedings have concluded, members of the confidentiality clubs or rings may be required to return or destroy the document. The problem with such an approach is that the receiving party’s ability to conduct and prepare for trial may be hampered. If the receiving party, being the party to the proceedings, is excluded from the confidentiality club, it may not be able to properly instruct its legal advisors or experts who are likewise unable to take instructions on the conduct of the matter. This would result in the receiving party having to conduct its trial with blinkers on (see <span class="font-italic">Koger Inc v O’Donnell</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2009] IEHC 385 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Koger Inc</span>”). For that reason, while confidentiality clubs excluding all representatives of the receiving party could be ordered, it is unusual and there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the same before a Court would do so (see <span class="font-italic">Koger Inc</span>.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 With that, I turn back to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No evidence that alleged commercially sensitive information would be used by H8 Holdings’ representatives </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 RIC is in the business of operating dormitories.

</div> RIC argued that the Information, if disclosed, would be used by Mr William and Joylicious Management to its detriment.

</div> However, apart from Ms Leong’s bare assertion, there was similarly no evidence of any such arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Second, RIC referred to Joylicious Management which is not a party to the present suit and would not be entitled to discovery of the General Ledgers in this Application. In a desperate attempt to draw the link between H8 Holdings and Joylicious Management, RIC said (in addition to Mr Han holding the shares in Joylicious Management on trust or as a nominee for Mr William) that Mr Han is related to Ms Han Jieling, a director and shareholder of H8 Holdings.

</div> H8 Holdings did not deny that Mr Han is Ms Han’s brother. However, just because Mr Han and Ms Han are siblings did not necessarily mean that Mr Han would be in possession of information that Ms Han received as H8 Holdings’ representative. There was no evidence before me that once Ms Han receives the General Ledgers, she would pass them on to Mr Han who would then use the same in furtherance of Joylicious Management’s business, causing RIC to suffer prejudice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Simply put, even if I accepted that the Information was commercially sensitive, there was no evidence before me to show how the General Ledgers, if disclosed, would cause prejudice to RIC. For that reason, I was of the view that the General Ledgers should be disclosed to H8 Holdings without redaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For completeness, parties showed me a copy of the General Ledgers with RIC’s proposed redactions at the hearing. H8 Holdings (in consultation with Mr Mann) submitted that the redacted version was insufficient for the purposes of the valuation as the information that remained unredacted was meaningless without context from the redacted portions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In this regard, I considered reviewing the unredacted version of the General Ledgers to determine whether the information sought to be redacted was commercially sensitive and/or if the scope of redaction could be limited such that the redacted version of the General Ledgers would still be meaningful for the valuation. I also considered whether a confidentiality ring could be set up such that only certain individuals from H8 Holdings (such as H8 Holdings’ legal advisors and Mr Mann) could have access to the unredacted General Ledgers.  However, as I was not satisfied (for the reasons set out at [69] to [71] above) that Joylicious Management, a company that is not even a party to this suit, would have access to the information contained in the General Ledgers and use the same to RIC’s detriment, I did not think it was necessary for me to go further to either consider the scope and extent of redaction or give directions for the formation of a confidentiality club </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Having found that (a) the General Ledgers were relevant and necessary to determining the issue of whether the 1,000,000 shares of RIC obtained by POP Holdings on or around 26 June 2018 were obtained at an undervalue and (b) there was no evidence that the Information in the General Ledgers, if disclosed to H8 Holdings, would cause prejudice to RIC, I allowed the Application and ordered that the General Ledgers be put into discovery and be disclosed to H8 Holdings without redaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I also ordered costs of the Application fixed at S$6,500 (all inclusive) to be paid by RIC to H8 Holdings. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Victor Choy<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Walter Ferix Silvester (Silvester Legal LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chen Sixue (Sim Chong LLC) for the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
