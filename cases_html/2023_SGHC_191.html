As NUS determined that she had failed to comply with certain requirements that were necessary for the award of her degree, NUS terminated her candidature on 4 September 2006, before she obtained her degree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 8 August 2012, Ms Ten commenced HC/S 667/2012 (“S 667”) against NUS, where she sought for NUS to award her the degree and claimed damages for breach of contract, the tort of misfeasance in public office, the tort of intimidation and the tort of negligence. On 9 July 2018, Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) dismissed S 667 (see <span class="font-italic">Ten Leu Jiun Jeanne-Marie v National </span><span class="font-italic">University of Singapore</span> [2018] SGHC 158).

This is on the basis that Ms Ten has “persistently commenced actions or made applications that are totally without merit”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 To support its application, NUS submits that s 73C of the SCJA was derived from and modelled after the United Kingdom’s (“UK”) Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”) r 3.11 and CPR Practice Direction 3C relating to ECROs, so it is helpful to refer to the UK cases on the applicable principles to determine whether the court should grant an ECRO.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The litigant must have commenced or made at least three actions or applications which are totally without merit in order to be taken to have ‘persistently’ commenced such actions or applications.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) An action or application would be considered ‘totally without merit’ if it is bound to fail in the sense that there is no rational basis on which it could succeed. It need not be abusive, made in bad faith, or supported by false evidence or documents in order to be totally without merit, but if it is, that will reinforce the case for a civil restraint order. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Subject to the minimum of at least three actions or applications required for the making of an ECRO, the persistence of the litigant in commencing such applications is to be evaluated by reference to the litigant’s overall conduct. It may be easier to conclude that a party is persistently commencing actions or applications which are totally without merit if it seeks repeatedly to relitigate issues which have been decided than if there are three or more unrelated applications many years apart. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) When considering whether to make a restraint order, the court is entitled to take into account any previous actions or applications which it concludes were totally without merit, and is not limited to actions or applications so certified at the time, albeit that in such cases the court will need to ensure that it knows sufficient about the previous action or application in question. In other words, the Court hearing the application for the ECRO is entitled retrospectively to adjudge an action or application to be totally without merit: <span class="font-italic">Perry v Brundle </span>[2015] EWHC 2737 at [27].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 NUS submits that it is evident from the procedural history that Ms Ten has persistently commenced at least three actions or applications that have been found by the court to be wholly without merit. The judgment in S 667 was deemed final and unappealable by the Court of Appeal in CA/OS 25/2020 (“OS 25”). Ms Ten nevertheless repeatedly sought to relitigate her allegations that NUS’s witnesses, particularly one Professor Lily Kong (“Prof Kong”), were dishonest in S 667, and that the judgment should thus be set aside or not be given effect to as it was obtained by a fraud upon the court. I will refer to this allegation neutrally as the “Allegation”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 NUS’ position is that in assessing whether the previous actions or applications were “totally without merit”, the court hearing the ECRO application should examine and refer to the views expressed by the court deciding those previous actions or applications. However, the court hearing the ECRO should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be conducting a substantive review of the merits of those decisions to see if they were wrong. It cannot act in an appellate capacity. NUS submits that it is therefore not the function of OA 21 to decide on the Allegation. In any event, Ms Ten had already made the Allegation before Woo J in S 667, and the Court of Appeal had made its observations on it in OS 25. Unless there is fresh material evidence of the Allegation, the Allegation should not be substantively assessed in this application for an ECRO.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 NUS relies heavily on the related litigation following S 667 to make out its claim that Ms Ten has persistently commenced actions or applications that are totally without merit. I therefore set out the relevant procedural history in detail below. Given the extensive procedural history, for ease of reference, after setting out the relevant actions or applications, I include NUS’s submissions on particular actions or applications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OS 25</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Following the dismissal of S 667 on 9 July 2018, Ms Ten filed OS 25 on 11 August 2020. This was an application for: (a) an extension of time to file a notice of appeal against the judgment; and (b) permission to appeal against the costs order in S 667.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 30 October 2020, the Court of Appeal dismissed OS 25 and awarded costs to NUS. The Court of Appeal found that the delay of close to two years was “very substantial” and that Ms Ten had failed to provide good reasons for her failure to comply with the one-month time limit for filing an appeal against the judgment under O 57 r 4 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). The court also found that Ms Ten’s intended appeal had “little prospect of success”, finding that her “overarching submission” that NUS had obtained judgment by fraud because its witnesses had committed perjury (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Allegation) was “unsubstantiated”. The court dismissed the application for permission to appeal against the costs order for similar reasons.

On 9 January 2020, after the Court of Appeal dismissed OS 25, Ms Ten filed an application, HC/OSB 3/2020 (“OSB 3”), to set aside the statutory demand. This was the basis that the judgment in S 667 should be disregarded as it was obtained by means of fraud upon the court in the form of perjury and was thus an abuse of process.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Ten did not dispute that the judgment debt had been based upon a valid and existing order of court. The judgment was final because Ms Ten’s application in OS 25 had been rejected by the Court of Appeal and there was no further avenue of appeal available for S 667.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The general principle is that the bankruptcy court would not go behind a judgment debt to question its validity. There was no reason to depart from the general principle. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) First, the materials Ms Ten had relied upon in support of the Allegation had been placed before and considered by Woo J in S 667. Ms Ten expressly acknowledged that these materials had been repeatedly highlighted to Woo J, and she had provided “no basis” to suggest that there were any additional or new matters that would enable the court to go behind the judgment in S 667.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Second, Ms Ten’s allegations had been raised before the Court of Appeal in OS 25, because the chance of the defaulting party succeeding was a consideration in whether an extension of time to file a notice of appeal should be granted. Ms Ten had also tendered further evidence in OS 25 by way of affidavit. Ms Ten was thus raising the same arguments she had already raised before the Court of Appeal in OS 25, a fact which Ms Ten expressly accepted. That the Court of Appeal had already concluded that Ms Ten’s arguments in her intended appeal had “little prospect of success” and found that her claims of perjury were unsubstantiated, only underscored how unlikely it was that Ms Ten’s arguments could succeed, given that the requisite threshold of showing sufficient merits at that stage was low.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 NUS submits that it is clear from the forgoing that OSB 3 was “an unmeritorious and baseless application which was bound to fail”, a fact reinforced by the dismissal of Ms Ten’s appeal against the decision of learned Assistant Registrar in OSB 3, HC/RA 316/2020 (“RA 316”).

</div> Maniam JC gave two main reasons for his decision. First, Maniam JC was not satisfied that there were any grounds on which the statutory demand ought to be set aside. This was because Ms Ten’s submissions in OSB 3 were premised on her dissatisfaction with the outcome of decisions she could no longer appeal against (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>S 667 and OS 25) and Ms Ten was not able to provide any other basis for the appeal.

</div> Maniam JC therefore explained to Ms Ten that “the costs judgment that the statutory demand is based on is now final and unappealable” and informed her that he could not set aside the judgment in S 667 on the basis that Woo J and the Court of Appeal were wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Second, and in any event, Maniam JC was not persuaded that Woo J and the Court of Appeal were wrong, based on Ms Ten’s affidavit and submissions.

In her letter, Ms Ten said that Maniam JC had not heard or considered her arguments for RA 316, as her application to adjourn the hearing to make submissions on a different date had been denied. Additionally, Ms Ten reiterated the arguments she raised in OSB 3 and made further arguments on why she believed that Maniam JC ought to have recused himself.

In doing so, the learned Assistant Registrar directly considered the Allegation and found that it had generally been put before Woo J in S 667, which was “undoubtedly final and conclusive on the merits”. As the materials relied upon by Ms Ten in support of the Allegation was contained in the affidavits and agreed bundles prepared for the trial of S 667 as well as in the transcript of the trial, there was “no new material on which the allegations of perjury were based which had not been placed before [Woo J]”. References to the judgment in S 667 itself could not be regarded as new material. Ms Ten had candidly agreed that all of the material relied upon in OS 226 had been placed before Woo J, with her main contention being that she had not been able to put her points in quite as much detail. Accordingly, the judgment in S 667 raised an issue estoppel and the allegations were barred by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 However, the learned Assistant Registrar did not accept that OS 25 was a final and conclusive judgment on the merits of the Allegation, as it was a determination on the grant of an extension of time. Nevertheless, the learned Assistant Registrar was of the view that Ms Ten’s claim that the judgment in S 667 had been tainted by fraud upon the court in the form of perjury and that the decisions could therefore be set aside was “legally and factually unsustainable”. There was no express procedure for setting aside a final and unappealable judgment and the threshold for invoking the court’s inherent jurisdiction was not met, as the issues and materials relied upon had already been raised before Woo J in S 667 and the Court of Appeal in OS 25. In the learned Assistant Registrar’s view, Ms Ten’s allegations of perjury were “really seeming inconsistencies between what Prof Kong had said in either her AEIC or oral testimony and the contemporaneous documents”, some of which had been noted by Woo J. Ms Ten’s dissatisfaction with Woo J’s findings or the absence of a specific finding on Prof Kong’s evidence would have been a matter for appeal. Accordingly, there was “simply no factual basis upon which [Ms Ten] could invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the court to set aside the S 667 Judgment, which was final and unappealable”.

In RA 351, Ms Ten had sought to adduce two pieces of fresh evidence. The first was a police report made by Ms Ten on 14 February 2022 which contained the Allegation, which was held by Thean J to lack any evidential value (at [25]). The second was a purported expert opinion premised on the materials already put before Woo J in S 667. Thean J held that the opinion was both irrelevant and inadmissible as it did not pertain to any scientific and technical fact. This distinguished it from the fresh material evidence tendered in the authorities cited by Ms Ten, <span class="font-italic">Takhar v Gracefield Developments Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2019] 2 WLR 984 and <span class="font-italic">Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673 (at [26] and [48]). Accordingly, there was no evidence that had not already been put before Woo J in S 667. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Although Thean J agreed with the learned Assistant Registrar that there had been no specific finding in S 667 regarding the Allegation (at [32] and [34]), Thean J nevertheless held that OS 226 was barred by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> as Ms Ten had previously raised issues pertaining to the honesty of NUS’s witnesses in S 667 and was again raising these same issues in OS 226 (at [40]). Thean J found that Ms Ten had not put forward any new evidence in OS 226, but was seeking to “establish fraud by pointing to the documentary evidence that was before the Court in Suit 667, and the findings in the Judgment itself” and that the primary purpose of OS 226 was “to advance a case that Suit 667 was wrongly decided <span class="font-italic">on the evidence that was before it</span>” [emphasis in original] (at [43]). Accordingly, Thean J held that OS 226 amounted to “nothing more than an impermissible collateral attack on the Judgment” (at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Finally, Thean J observed that Ms Ten’s own case was that she was seeking to make the same arguments that had already been made in S 667 and was not seeking to rely on any new evidence (at [50]–[51]). In Thean J’s view, none of Ms Ten’s arguments were of sufficient materiality to be tested at trial (at [53]). Therefore, OS 226 was “legally and factually unsustainable” (at [46] and [54]). Thean J also found the additional prayers sought in OS 226 to be “legally and factually unsustainable” and therefore “frivolous and vexatious” (at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 NUS submits that the dismissal of RA 351 underscores the fact that Ms Ten’s appeal in RA 351 (and her underlying application in OS 226) was totally without merit.

</div> The Appellate Division of the High Court dismissed OA 26 on 7 February 2023. The Appellate Division held that no permission was required to appeal against the striking out, but noted that no explanation had been provided for the failure to file a notice of appeal within the required timeframe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In considering Ms Ten’s prospects of success on appeal, the Appellate Division held that Ms Ten could not cross the low threshold of showing that the intended appeal was not hopeless and that the appeal was “bound to fail”. There was therefore “no merit in an appeal” against RA 351 and its costs order. The Appellate Division affirmed that a judgment could not be set aside on the basis of fraud unless the fraud was discovered after the judgment was passed and the fraud is proven by material fresh evidence. It held that Thean J was correct in “concluding that the evidence relied upon by [Ms Ten] was not fresh evidence of fraud”. In doing so, the Appellate Division found that the authorities relied upon by Ms Ten to submit that this was not a requirement did not support her argument. The need for fresh evidence struck a balance between ensuring finality of litigation and preserving the integrity of the court process. Furthermore, the Appellate Division affirmed that the evidence adduced by Ms Ten in RA 351 (the police report and opinion evidence) was not relevant. Accordingly, Ms Ten was not granted an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal against the Court’s decision in RA 351.

Referring to Thean J’s view that Woo J had not made any specific findings on the Allegation in S 667 and the decision that OS 226 had to be struck out as no fresh material evidence had been adduced (above at [26]), Ms Ten argued that this meant that Thean J had impliedly told Ms Ten to “go out and get some fresh evidence” supporting the Allegation. In her letter, Ms Ten explained that if Prof Kong is convicted following the Magistrate’s Complaint, this would amount to new evidence that would entitle Ms Ten to commence another action to set aside the judgment in S 667 on the basis of the Allegation.

</div> NUS highlights that Ms Ten has repeatedly brought actions and applications premised on the same contention: that the judgment in S 667 and subsequent decisions ought to be set aside on the basis of the Allegation. NUS argues that Ms Ten’s inability to accept determinations against her is demonstrated by her propensity to allege that the court has failed to consider her arguments whenever her action or application is dismissed, her multiple allegations of apparent bias, and her repeated requests to make further submissions after the dismissal of an action or application. NUS thus submits that Ms Ten’s prior and ongoing conduct demonstrates her persistence in attempting to challenge the judgment in S 667 by repeated litigation over the same issues.

NUS submits that this should be considered alongside the apparent lack of financial disincentive or constraint to deter or prevent Ms Ten from commencing further applications or actions against NUS. Although Ms Ten has admitted to being impecunious and although she has yet to repay the judgment debt as required under the bankruptcy proceedings, Ms Ten has continued to pursue various actions or applications resulting in further costs orders against her in RA 316, SUM 1613, RA 351, SUM 1658, and OA 26, none of which have been recovered from Ms Ten. NUS contends that adverse costs orders against Ms Ten have been demonstrably insufficient to deter her from relitigating the Allegation.

In any event, as I will explain below, such a submission is not germane on the facts of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Before I undertake a more detailed analysis of s 73C(1) of the SCJA, it would be useful to briefly set out the background to the civil restraint order regime. This regime was introduced by way of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment No. 2) Act 2018 (Act 46 of 2018). I reproduce the explanation by the then-Senior Minister of State for Law (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (2 October 2018), vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The policy intention behind these amendments is … to allow the courts to have, and to be able to take, a more nuanced approach in terms of the orders that they make in managing the different levels of culpability of the vexatious litigants. And this allows the judges to have more regard to the individual circumstances of each case and to make those distinctions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in terms of how and when these orders are to be applied, it will be for the courts to carefully consider all the facts and circumstances of each case before exercising their discretion on whether to do so or not … the jurisprudence in this area must ultimately be left to be developed through the exercise of principled discretion by our judges, based on the actual facts and the context before them …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It may be helpful to consider that these restraint orders have in fact been applied in jurisdictions like the UK … The factors I believe are clear, and they have been considered in previous cases also in the UK. And our Courts will no doubt take reference to, although it will not be strictly bound by these cases, when they have regard to these applications with the specific facts before them in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I would like to touch on the scope of the extended civil restraint orders under the new section 73C … and whether it is intended to be identical to the interpretation the UK courts have taken under their Civil Procedure Rules, and the factors that the Court should consider in determining whether a new action or application falls under the extended civil restraint order. When construing the new section 73C, the position adopted by the UK courts may be persuasive but our courts are obviously not bound to follow their interpretation. Different considerations in different jurisdictions will obviously dictate differences in the approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Section 73C(1) of the SCJA is modelled after rule 3.11 of the UK CPR read with CPR Practice Direction 3C, and the latter provides as follows in paragraph 3.1:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Extended civil restraint orders</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1 An extended civil restraint order may be made by –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) a judge of the Court of Appeal;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) a judge of the High Court; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) a Designated Civil Judge or their appointed deputy in the County Court,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">where a party has persistently issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Since s 73C of the SCJA is modelled after the UK CPR, I agree that the principles in <span class="font-italic">Sartipy</span> as summarised by NUS is useful and relevant. However, these principles are not binding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I begin by addressing the interpretation of “persistently commenced”. I note that <span class="font-italic">Sartipy</span> mentions that the litigant should have commenced or made least three prior actions or applications which are totally without merit, in order to be taken to have “persistently” commenced such actions or applications (<span class="font-italic">Sartipy</span> at [28]). Conversely, in the only reported decision of the Singapore court on the issuance of an ECRO, <span class="font-italic">Joseph Clement Louis Arokiasamy v Singapore Airlines Ltd and another matter </span>[2020] 5 SLR 869 (“<span class="font-italic">Joseph Clement</span>”), Maniam JC did not impose such a quantitative requirement, observing that the word “persistently” in s 73C(1) of the SCJA “indicates that more than one unmeritorious action or application would have to be brought before section 73C of the SCJA comes into operation” (at [43]). This <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> was made in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, since Maniam JC found in <span class="font-italic">Joseph Clement </span>that four actions or applications had been brought that were totally without merit (at [36]). It does not appear that <span class="font-italic">Sartipy</span> had been brought to the attention of the court in <span class="font-italic">Joseph Clement</span>. When <span class="font-italic">Joseph Clement</span> was brought to the attention of counsel for NUS, his submission was that given how s 73C of the SCJA is worded, there may be situations where two applications within a short period of time, when considered together with the conduct of the litigant, could demonstrate persistence for the purposes of an ECRO application. NUS submits that the assessment ought to be a function of the number of actions and applications, the time period, and the litigant’s conduct in those proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In this case, and in view of my assessment of the actions and applications brought by Ms Ten set out below, the specific legal issue of whether there must be a minimum of three prior actions or applications before an ECRO can be issued under s 73C of the SCJA, likewise does not arise on the facts. This is because NUS is basing its application for an ECRO on the basis of at least four prior actions or applications that are “totally without merit”. While Ms Ten submits that an appeal of an action or application should effectively be “bundled” and counted only as one action or application for the purposes of assessing the number of prior actions or applications, I note that s 73C of the SCJA does not contain such a distinction. I also note that in <span class="font-italic">Sartipy</span>, the court held that if a claim itself is totally without merit, and individual applications arising therefrom are also totally without merit, the claim and each application can be counted for the purposes of determining whether or not to grant an ECRO (at [29]). Further, in <span class="font-italic">Panton </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Vale of White Horse District Council and another </span>[2020] EWHC 167 (Ch), it was held that appeals can be regarded as one action or application, without requiring the “bundling” of the appeal with the underlying application (at [61]–[62]). I find these decisions persuasive. For the purpose of s 73C of the SCJA, I will consider appeals as one action or application. In light of the above, I make the observations below only in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 <span class="font-italic">Sartipy</span> itself at [28] simply affirms <span class="font-italic">CFC 26 Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Brown Shipley &amp; Co Ltd and others </span>[2017] 1 WLR 4589 (“<span class="font-italic">CFC 26</span>”), which directly deals with the interpretation of “persistently”, finding that it means “at least three” (<span class="font-italic">CFC 26 </span>at [13]). The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">CFC 26</span> appears to be twofold. First, citing <span class="font-italic">Courtman v Ludlam</span> [2009] EWHC 2067, the civil restraint order regime was intended to provide graduated responses, such that an ECRO ought to have a higher pre-condition threshold compared to a Limited Civil Restraint Order (“LCRO”) (<span class="font-italic">CFC 26</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]).  Second, the court in <span class="font-italic">CFC 26</span> reasoned that had it been intended that an ECRO would be available where there has been no more than two unmeritorious claims or applications, the draftsman would have said so expressly (<span class="font-italic">CFC 26</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I note that Singapore also has a regime for issuing a LCRO. This is under s 73B of the SCJA, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limited civil restraint orders</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73B.—(1)  A court may, if satisfied that a party has made 2 or more applications that are totally without merit, make a limited civil restraint order against the party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The LCRO and ECRO regime provide a graduated and nuanced response to different circumstances through the scope of the restraint imposed. In the case of an LCRO, the restraint applies to further applications in the legal proceedings in respect of which the LCRO was made (s 73B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SCJA). For an ECRO, the restraint applies to “commencing any action or making any application” that concerns “any matter involving, relating to, touching upon or leading to the legal proceedings in respect of which the order is made” (s 73C(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SCJA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The grant of a LCRO under s 73B of the SCJA is conditioned on a specified number of “2 or more applications”. This is identical to the position in the UK. This can be contrasted with s 73C of the SCJA, which contains no explicit quantitative requirement, aside from the persistent commencement of actions or applications for the issuance of an ECRO. Such a quantitative requirement could have been inserted, particularly since this was done for the LCRO regime under s 73B of the SCJA, but it was not. The relevant parliamentary debates also do not mention a quantitative requirement in relation to the ECRO, in contrast to the LCRO (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (2 October 2018), vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Clause 10 of the Bill introduces the new civil restraint orders. They are meant in the first instance, to be used in situations where the litigants have persistently initiated proceedings that are groundless and without merit. So, the litigant has to do it <span class="font-italic">more than once, multiple times, at least twice in the case of the first rung or the lowest grade of the orders</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and also without merit. These are done often with the purpose of annoying or embarrassing the other party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In addition, in my view, it is conceptually possible for a litigant to be shown to have been “persistent” on the basis of two prior unmeritorious actions or applications – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there need not be at least three prior actions or applications – though that would have to be demonstrated on the evidence. At the same time, clearly, the greater the number of prior actions or applications that are totally without merit, the stronger the evidence of persistence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, in relation to the requirement that the prior actions or applications be “totally without merit”, I consider that this can be satisfied where the court hearing the prior action or application so considered the matter to be “totally without merit”. This could be expressed in its <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> or apparent from its reasoning and decision. While Ms Ten made extensive submissions on the errors of the previous decisions (see [45] above), I do not consider them to be germane to this ECRO application. It is not the role nor purview of a court hearing an ECRO application, to review if past decisions were wrong. This would be wrongly engaging in what is effectively an appellate role, long after the time for an appeal has passed, without the jurisdiction to do so. The proper forum for submissions on the merits and the findings of fact of a decision is an appeal of the relevant decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Actions or applications that are “totally without merit”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that Ms Ten has “persistently commenced actions or made applications that are totally without merit” within the meaning of s 73C(1) of the SCJA. This can be seen from her previous actions or applications that were made from 9 January 2020 to 16 December 2022, and which were considered by the court hearing the matter to be totally without merit, or from which it is apparent from the reasoning of the court hearing the matter that they were totally without merit. These include the following actions or applications: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Her application in OSB 3 on 9 January 2020, to set aside the statutory demand that was served by NUS on the basis that the judgment in S 667 should be disregarded as it was obtained by means of fraud upon the court in the form of perjury (see above at [10]). The learned Assistant Registrar found no basis to set aside the statutory demand. It was undisputed that the judgment debt was based on a valid and existing order of court and undisputed that the materials relied upon by Ms Ten had been placed before Woo J in S 667 and the Court of Appeal in OS 25. The learned Assistant Registrar therefore concluded that OSB 3 did not provide any basis for going behind the judgment in S 667. I am thus satisfied that OSB 3 was an application that was commenced totally without merit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Her appeal in RA 316 against the dismissal of OSB 3. In dismissing RA 316, Maniam JC had observed that Ms Ten’s application in OSB 3 was premised on her dissatisfaction with the judgment in S 667 and the Court of Appeal’s decision in OS 25 and that Ms Ten had not provided any other basis in support of RA 316. Maniam JC was not satisfied that there were any grounds to allow RA 316. His decision was principally based on the fact that the costs judgment that the statutory demand was based on was final and unappealable (see above at [13]). I am thus satisfied that RA 316 was an application that was commenced totally without merit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Her action in OS 226 on 10 March 2021, to set aside the judgment in S 667 on the basis of the Allegation. In SUM 1613, the learned Assistant Registrar held that the issues raised by Prayers 1 and 2 of OS 226 were barred by the extended doctrine <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The substance of the Allegation had been put before Woo J in S 667, which was a final and conclusive judgment, and Ms Ten had adduced no new material in OS 226 which had not already been placed before Woo J. Ms Ten’s claim that the judgment in S 667 could be set aside on the basis of the Allegation was “legally and factually unsustainable”, and should have properly been brought by way of an appeal against the judgment in S 667. There was “simply no factual basis” for Ms Ten’s application (see above at [22]). I agree that striking out applications involve an extremely high threshold and that an action will only be struck out in a plain and obvious case and/or if it was clearly unsustainable. The fact that OS 226 was struck out therefore shows that OS 226 was deemed to be totally without merit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Her appeal in RA 351 against SUM 1613. In dismissing RA 351, Thean J had agreed that OS 226 was barred by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The Judge found that Ms Ten was raising the same issues and relying on the same evidence pertaining to the Allegation in OS 226, that had been raised and adduced in S 667. Ms Ten’s claim that Woo J had wrongly decided S 667 on the evidence that was before Woo J amounted to “nothing more than an impermissible collateral attack on the Judgment”. The evidence Ms Ten sought to rely upon in RA 351 was based on material already put before Woo J and did not constitute fresh evidence. Given that Ms Ten had not raised any <span class="font-italic">fresh</span> material evidence in OS 226, Thean J held that it must be struck out (see above at [26]). I am satisfied that Thean J’s dismissal of RA 351 confirms that OS 226 was an action that was totally without merit, and am satisfied that RA 351 itself was an application that was totally without merit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Her application in OA 26 on 16 December 2022 to seek permission to appeal against the decision in RA 351. In dismissing OA 26, the Appellate Division noted that Ms Ten had not provided any explanation for her delay in filing the notice of appeal. The Appellate Division considered that there was “no merit” in an appeal against RA 351 and affirmed the conclusions of Thean J in RA 351. Accordingly, the Appellate Division found that “the appeal was bound to fail” (see above at [30]). I am thus satisfied that OA 26 was an application that was totally without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I note that even with respect to OC 328, Ms Ten has not stated that she will proceed with it only if she has fresh evidence of the Allegation. OC 328 was filed before any criminal proceedings had been commenced. When Ms Ten was asked about this at the hearing, her response was that fresh evidence would help, but she would need to think about it more. It was apparent from her response that she did not want to rule out putting before the court hearing OC 328, the same evidence that she has relied upon thus far. There is hence a distinct likelihood that Ms Ten will continue to commence future proceedings on the same evidential substratum, for which numerous court decisions have already made clear would be bound to fail.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Ms Ten submits that this court must decide on the Allegation and if the court finds that there is any merit to the Allegation, then the court cannot impose an ECRO on her. However, as seen from the Procedural History and the above analysis, the merit of the Allegation was not a consideration of the Courts hearing the previous actions or applications. Amongst other reasons, it was the repeated absence of fresh material evidence of the Allegation (not based on materials already put before Woo J in S 667) which rendered these actions and applications totally without merit. Absent fresh material evidence, there was no basis to go behind the Judgment in S 667, which was final and conclusive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In any event, I note that Ms Ten also recognises that the proper examination of the documentary evidence of whether Prof Kong committed perjury can only be done at a proper criminal trial of Prof Kong, on the charges of perjury as set out in Ms Ten’s Magistrate’s Complaint.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision to grant the ECRO</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I therefore agree with NUS that an ECRO should be made against Ms Ten. I note that NUS has sought a duration of two years for the ECRO (unless extended by the court). This duration is within what is provided for under s 73C(4) of the SCJA, which stipulates a maximum restraint of two years, subject to further extension by the Court. In light of the evidence of Ms Ten’s propensity to commence actions or applications that are totally without merit, from 9 January 2020 to 16 December 2022, I consider two years to be an appropriate period, that is proportionate in the circumstances. Accordingly, I grant order in terms of the NUS’ prayers as set out under prayers (a) to (c) of OA 21, including its application to include OC 328 in the ECRO. I set out the orders below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the Defendant, Ms Ten Leu Jiun Jeanne-Marie, be restrained from commencing any action or making any application, in any Court or Subordinate Court (as defined in section 2 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969), concerning any matter involving, relating to, touching upon and/or leading to the following legal proceedings without the permission of the Court that made this order:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) High Court Suit No. 667 of 2012;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Originating Summons (Bankruptcy) No. 3 of 2020 (HC/OSB 3/2020);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Originating Summons No. 25 of 2020 (CA/OS 25/2020);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Registrar’s Appeal No. 316 of 2020 (HC/RA 316/2020);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Originating Summons (Creditor’s Bankruptcy Application) No. 335 of 2021 (HC/B 335/2021);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) Originating Summons No. 226 of 2021 (HC/OS 226/2021);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) Summons No. 1613 of 2021 (HC/SUM 1613/2021);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) Summons No. 5255 of 2021 (HC/SUM 5255/2021);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ix) Registrar’s Appeal No. 351 of 2021 (HC/RA 351/2021);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(x) Summons No. 1658 of 2022 (HC/SUM 1658/2022); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xi) Originating Application No. 26 of 2022 (AD/OA 26/2022); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xii) Originating Claim No. 328 of 2023 (HC/OC 328/2023).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This order shall remain in effect for two years from today, unless extended pursuant to section 73C(5) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 and/or the inherent powers of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the Defendant commences an action or makes an application (other than for the permission of the Court under section 73C(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969), in any Court or Subordinate Court, contrary to paragraph 2 (a) of this order, that action or application is to be treated as struck out or dismissed –</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) without the Court having to make any further order; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) without the need for any other party to be heard on the merits of that action or application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether fresh evidence should be precluded</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Ms Ten submits that, if she prevails in OA 603 and succeeds in obtaining the Attorney-General’s fiat to privately prosecute Prof Kong for perjury and obstruction of justice pursuant to ss 191 and 193 of the Penal Code 1871, she might be able to surface new evidence of Prof Kong’s perjury that had not previously been brought to the attention of the court in the previous actions and applications. She should hence not be barred from putting forth her case on the basis of any such evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 A key basis of the decisions in the previous actions and applications is that Ms Ten has been unable to adduce <span class="font-italic">fresh </span>material evidence not based on facts and circumstances that were already before Woo J in S 667. I therefore agree with Ms Ten that an ECRO should not bar her from proceeding on the basis of fresh evidence of the Allegation. I also agree with NUS that this can be addressed by the provision for Ms Ten to apply to court for permission to commence any action or make any application concerning any matter relating to the legal proceedings covered by the ECRO, provided that she furnish fresh material evidence of the Allegation to support her application for permission. The provision for seeking permission is set out in s 73C(2) of the SCJA. Paragraph 2(a) of the proposed ECRO also contains similar phrasing to s 73C(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SCJA. Ms Ten has nevertheless asked that the court not grant the ECRO, on the basis that it would impose an additional burden on her continuing with her pursuit of her claims. I consider that imposing this additional step for permission is necessary given my findings above, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that she has persistently commenced actions or applications that are totally without merit, and there is no assurance that she will not continue to do so on the same basis, despite several court decisions ruling against her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65  For the reasons above, I will grant the ECRO on the terms as stated above. Ms Ten had asked that she be allowed to put in written submissions on costs. Parties are to file their written submissions on costs, of not more than seven pages, within seven days of this Judgment.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chia Voon Jiet, Charlene Wong Su-Yi, Grace Lim Si Rui and Tay Jia Yi Pesdy (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Defendant in person.</div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
