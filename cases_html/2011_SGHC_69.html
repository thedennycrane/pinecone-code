<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In an earlier decision <em>Ching
                        Chew Weng Paul v Ching Pui Sim and others</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 76 (“the Judgment”), I described this case as
                    “the unfortunate quest of the plaintiff to recover assets which his
                    father, the late Ching Kwong Kuen (“KK Ching”) had intended to
                    leave behind for him”. At the conclusion of the trial, the plaintiff
                    substantially prevailed and the 1<sup>st</sup>,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were ordered to transfer various assets including shares in several companies
                    back to the estate of KK Ching under which the plaintiff was the sole
                    beneficiary. After the Judgment was delivered, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                        (<em>ie</em> the aunt and cousins of the plaintiff)
                    representing the estate of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (who
                        <em>elected</em> not to participate in the trial
                    following the demise of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant) filed
                    a Notice of Appeal against the Judgment. The other defendants did not appeal. On
                    2 March 2010, I heard and dismissed the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ application to stay the
                    execution of the Judgment against an undertaking from the estate of KK Ching not
                    to transfer the shares pending the outcome of the appeal. Two days later, on
                    4 March 2010, the plaintiff, who was suffering from terminal cancer
                    (unknown to me during the trial), passed away. On 19 April 2010 the appeal
                    lapsed when the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants failed to file their Record of Appeal, Core Bundle and the
                    Appellants’ Case altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Six months later, this unfortunate and somewhat
                    tragic case was “<em>resurrected</em>” by the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    (who had then instructed a new set of solicitors). An application was filed on
                    9 September 2010 in this action to set aside the Judgment on the limited
                    ground that the Judgment, insofar as it affects the estate of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, was procured by fraud. Recognising
                    the issue of prejudice to the estate of the plaintiff in view of his untimely
                    demise, the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants astutely steered away from
                    alleging fraud directly against the plaintiff. Instead they directed the fraud
                    accusation solely against another cousin, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant, and submitted that the plaintiff’s evidence at the trial was
                    entirely based on the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.
                    I heard the application over 2 days and on 10 December 2010, I
                    delivered my oral grounds in dismissing the application. I arrived at the firm
                    conclusion that the “<em>fresh</em>” evidence
                    raised by the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants did not even come close to establishing fraud. As the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants have since appealed against my
                    decision, I now provide my full grounds for dismissing the
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This decision will examine the applicable
                    principles to set aside a regular judgment purportedly procured by fraud, in
                    particular, the ambit of the fraud exception, the degree of proof required to
                    establish fraud and the relevance and necessity, if any, for the applicant to
                    sufficiently explain the reasons for the absence from the trial and the delay in
                    filing the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The action was commenced by the plaintiff on
                    25 August 2008. Initially, each of the defendants (except the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant) was represented by different sets
                    of solicitors and each of them filed their respective defences. In particular,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant filed a bare denial which
                    merely put the plaintiff to strict proof. Shortly after his defence was filed,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant passed away on 21 October
                    2008. Thereafter, the plaintiff applied for the 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants to be substituted as parties to
                    continue the action against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       More than a year after the death of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the trial of the action was
                    eventually heard before me over four days on 2 to 4, and 6 November 2009.
                    Despite being added as parties and being served with all the court papers, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    elected not to participate in the proceedings at all. The plaintiff and all the
                    other defendants testified at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I delivered my decision on 4 December 2009.
                    I found, <em>inter alia</em>, that the following assets
                    were held on trust by the various defendants for the estate of KK Ching:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 4 January 2010, a Notice of Appeal was
                    filed by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants. It should be noted that the
                    appeal was filed within time. In tandem with the appeal, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    also applied to stay the execution of the Judgment pending the outcome of the
                    appeal. It is pertinent to highlight that the ground for the stay application
                    was essentially the uncovering of “<em>fresh</em>” evidence which contradicted the findings in the
                    Judgment. As explained above, the stay application was heard and dismissed by me
                    on 2 March 2010. Shortly after the stay application was dismissed, the
                    appeal lapsed. No attempt was made by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants for extension of time to pursue
                    the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Some five months after the appeal had lapsed and
                    some nine months after the Judgment was delivered, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    on 9 September 2010 applied to set aside the Judgment insofar as it affects
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 10 August 2010, the executors of the
                    plaintiff’s Will were added as 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs to the action. Unless the context
                    otherwise requires, all references to the plaintiff in this decision shall refer
                    to Paul Ching Chew Weng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The application to set aside the Judgment was
                    initially fixed before Chan J on 14 September 2010. During the hearing,
                    Ms Deborah Barker representing the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants clarified that the application was
                    made under O 35 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) which empowers the court
                    to set aside any judgment or order granted in the absence of a party. However,
                    under O 35 r 2, such an application must be made within 14 days from the
                    date of the judgment. As the Judgment was delivered on 4 December 2009, the
                    application was out of time by almost nine months. Accordingly, Chan J
                    directed the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants to file an application to extend
                    time. Both applications were heard together before me. I will deal with the
                    reasons proffered by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants for their inordinate delay in
                    filing the application as well as their absence from the trial separately
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In deciding whether to set aside a judgment
                    after trial under O 35 r 2, the following factors are relevant (see
                        <em>Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 673 at [44])
                        (“<em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em>”):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the reasons for the defendant’s absence at
                            the trial;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the successful party will be
                            prejudiced;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the length of the applicant’s
                        delay;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether a complete trial is

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">considerations of public interest.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the outset of the hearing, Ms Barker
                    made clear that the application was based entirely on the premise that the
                    Judgment was procured by actual fraud and the fraud accusation was directed
                    solely at the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. On this note, I will
                    consider each of the above factors in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ absence from trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Court of Appeal in <em>Su
                        Sh-Hsyu</em> held that (at [44]), where judgment has been entered after trial in the
                    defendant’s absence, the predominant consideration in deciding whether to
                    set aside the judgment is the reason for the defendant’s absence. The
                    authorities are clear that the burden is on the party who was absent to provide
                    sufficiently cogent reasons to explain the absence from trial. As emphasised in
                        <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em> at [57], a Court is reluctant to set aside the judgment if the
                    absence was deliberate and contumelious:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, it can be seen that <em>the reasons for
                            non-attendance will be most severely viewed (vis-à-vis the other
                            relevant factors set out in</em><a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> <em>above) in instances where the applicant’s omission
                            was deliberate and contumelious. In such cases, the court will be most
                            reluctant to set aside the judgment even though there may be other
                            countervailing factors in favour of setting aside</em>. Any such
                        countervailing factors would necessarily have to be very compelling to tilt
                        the balance in favour of setting aside the judgment. On the other hand,
                        where the reason for non-appearance was wholly innocent or due to mistake or
                        unavoidable accident, the court will be more inclined to set aside the
                        judgment. In exercising its discretion, the other factors, such as whether
                        the other party would be irremediably prejudiced, will feature more heavily
                        in the court’s consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It would seem from the authorities that
                    absence from trial due to personal reasons or personal difficulties would not
                    necessarily prevent the Court from finding that the absence was nonetheless
                    deliberate. Such was the case in <em>Shocked v
                        Goldschmidt</em> [1998] 1 All ER 372 (“<em>Shocked</em>”) where the applicant, a musician, was
                    recording and touring around the world at the time when the trial took place.
                    Although the applicant was informed in advance by her counsel of the trial date,
                    she explained that she could not attend the trial as she was on tour, and was
                    without a personal manager, a backing band, and money (see <em>Shocked</em> at p 375). The English Court of Appeal (at
                    p 382) was unconvinced that these personal reasons could justify her
                    absence from trial and observed that even with these personal difficulties, no
                    explanation was provided for her failure to apply for an adjournment. No
                    allegation of fraud was raised and in view of the applicant’s deliberate
                    choice to be absent from trial, the English Court of Appeal decided to dismiss
                    the application to set aside the judgment. In similar vein, the defendant in
                        <em>Lee Ngiap Pheng Tony v Cheong Ming Kiat (Zhang Minjie)
                        (trading as Autohomme Automobiles)</em> [2010] 4 SLR 831
                        (“<em>Lee Ngiap Pheng”</em>) explained
                    that his absence from trial was because he was hounded by creditors, that he did
                    not think that the trial would be fruitful and that he did not fully appreciate
                    the necessity for his trial attendance. The Court held that these did not
                    constitute valid reasons to explain his deliberate absence from the trial. The
                    Court observed that unlike the case of <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em>,
                    no allegation of fraud was raised as a basis to set aside the judgment; and in
                    view of the unsatisfactory attempts to explain the absence from trial, the Court
                    decided against setting aside the judgment. Nevertheless, I must emphasise that
                    there is no overriding principle that personal reasons or personal difficulties
                    will never be accepted as valid reasons to explain the absence from the trial. A
                    Court would be inclined to set aside the judgment where the personal reasons
                    given, if accepted, could show that the absence from the trial was wholly
                    innocent or due to mistake or unavoidable accident (see <em>Su
                        Sh-Hsyu</em> at [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the present case, there is no dispute that
                    the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were well aware of the trial dates. Despite so, they chose not to participate or
                    even attend the trial. The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants explained that their absence from
                    trial was due to certain subjective assumptions on their part. The
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    made the following claims:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                        defendants] thought they would not be able to contribute and trusted Paul to
                        do the right thing. They did not expect Paul and Sally to withhold
                        information from this Court, as there was no reason to suspect their motives
                        at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was reiterated by the 6<sup>th</sup>
                    defendant’s claim that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] passed away, we [the
                            5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                        defendants] trusted Paul to conduct the matter in a just and reasonable
                        manner, as we did not have personal knowledge of the alleged Trust
                        Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In particular, the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant stated the
                        following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On hindsight, had we [the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                            9<sup>th</sup> defendants] known that Paul would
                        withhold material information from this Honourable Court, we would have
                        actively participated in the proceedings and challenged his claim. We had
                        mistakenly trusted our cousin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In my view, the above reasons were completely
                    unconvincing. The assertion that they trusted the plaintiff to conduct the
                    matter in a just and reasonable manner was disingenuous as it runs contrary to
                    the complaints by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant about the
                    plaintiff’s allegedly unreasonable behaviour:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Only two days after [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s]
                        death, we received the <em>flurry of letters from
                            Paul</em> and his solicitors...Paul <em>expressed
                            no concern</em> over my father’s death save that it should
                        not delay the proceedings...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...soon after my father’s death, Paul...<em>began to
                            hassle us</em> in respect of our father’s will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In view of such significant insinuations of
                    unreasonable behaviour on the plaintiff’s part before the trial, it was
                    plainly disingenuous of the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants to claim that they had
                    trusted the plaintiff to conduct the proceedings in a just and reasonable
                    manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Even more pertinently, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants’ explanation that there was no reason to suspect that the
                    plaintiff or the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would withhold
                    information is no excuse for being absent from trial. It is common ground that
                    the writ with the Statement of Claim was served on the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    in February 2009 after they were added as parties to the action pursuant to an
                    order for substituted service following unsuccessful attempts at personal
                    service. It was also undisputed that copies of all subsequent pleadings were
                    duly served on the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants. From the pleadings, the
                    plaintiff’s and 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    Affidavits of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”), the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were fully aware of the evidence that was alleged against the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant from the outset. It is that same
                    evidence which the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants have now alleged to be fraudulent.
                    The 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    could easily have adopted the same position to contest the trial. Accordingly,
                    in the face of the pleadings and the AEICs of the plaintiff and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants, based on their own case theory,
                    could not have reasonably believed that the plaintiff would conduct the trial in
                    a fair and reasonable manner. Therefore, they had every reason to contest the
                    claims and yet they chose to absent themselves from the trial
                altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Crucially, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant’s position as regards the claims was expressed in his defence
                    that was filed and served before he passed away. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant clearly denied the
                    plaintiff’s claims (notwithstanding the bare denial) regarding the 1982
                        trusts,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    and put the plaintiff to strict proof regarding his claims as regards the 1984
                        trusts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> It
                    was further stated that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was unable
                    to look for or locate all the relevant documents to respond to the
                    plaintiff’s claims regarding the 1982 trusts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In view of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s position before he passed
                    away, there was more than sufficient reason for the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    to verify and contest the claims made by the plaintiff, and more significantly,
                    there was more than sufficient time for them to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants claim that they were deeply
                    grieved by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s death and
                    were not in the proper frame of mind to deal with the proceedings at that
                        time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I
                    do not find this to be a persuasive reason. After the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant passed away, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    had the proper frame of mind to handle matters relating to the companies which
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant used to run.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, the trial was more than a year after the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s death. I have also taken
                    into consideration the material admission that the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    could have instructed lawyers to advise them on the suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ delay in applying to set aside
                the Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Court of Appeal in <em>Su
                        Sh-Hsyu</em> held that the applicant’s delay in applying to set
                    aside the judgment is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration. In
                        <em>Vallipuram Gireesa Venkit Eswaran v Scanply International
                        Wood Product (S) Pte Ltd (Kim Yew Trading Co, third party)</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 507 (“<em>Vallipuram</em>”), the application to set aside the judgment was
                    made two years after the conclusion of the trial on the ground that it was a
                    procedurally irregular judgment (there was no allegation of fraud). In
                    dismissing the application, the Court took into consideration the fact that no
                    explanation was provided for the delay. The same approach was adopted in
                        <em>Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd v Wastecol Manufacturing
                        Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</em> [1988] 3 MLJ 215 (“<em>Wastecoal Manufacturing</em>”), where the application
                    to aside a default judgment was made nine months late. The application was based
                    on the purported merits of the defence. Notably, no allegation of fraud was
                    raised. The Court held that the applicant’s failure to explain the
                    inordinate delay of nine months raised much doubts as to the <em>bona fides</em> of his application, and thereafter dismissed the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the present case, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were served with the Judgment on 4 December 2009, the very same day when
                    the Judgment was delivered.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In the hearing
                    before me, Ms Barker explained that an appeal was filed on the instructions
                    of the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants. The 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants alleged that the appeal was allowed to lapse due to inadvertence of
                    their former solicitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> However, no detail was
                    provided to explain the nature of the inadvertence in filing the appeal
                    documents. In this regard, it is helpful to refer to the observations of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic
                        Party and others and another suit</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 757
                    at [22] (in the context of granting
                    leave to file a notice of appeal out of time) that mere inadvertence, in and of
                    itself, is insufficient to constitute a good reason to explain the delay:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the delay is not merely <em>de minimis</em>, the
                        court must examine the reasons for such delay. A mere assertion that there
                        has been an oversight is obviously insufficient and, indeed, could lead to
                        an abuse of process. In the decision of this court in <em>Denko-HLB Sdn Bhd v Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                        2 SLR(R) 336 ("<em>Denko</em>"), for example,
                        Chao Hick Tin JA (as he then was), who delivered the grounds of
                        decision of the court, observed thus (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Not only was the length of the delay quite substantial (bearing in mind
                        [that] the prescribed period of time within which a party must apply to the
                        judge for further arguments was only seven days), there were no extenuating
                        circumstances offered for the 'oversight' of the solicitor. Some explanation
                        should have been offered to mitigate or excuse the oversight. If, in every
                        case, 'oversight' is <em>per s</em>e a satisfactory
                        ground, we run the risk of turning the rules prescribing time into dead
                        letters. It would be observed in breach. It would be all too simple for a
                        party to run to a judge to ask for indulgence because of oversight. The need
                        for finality must be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In any event, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    could have applied for leave to file and serve the appeal documents out of time
                    given that the Notice of Appeal was filed within time. No reason was provided to
                    explain the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants’ omission to make such an application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Furthermore, I did not see how the explanation
                    for the lapse in filing the appeal documents could be a valid excuse for the
                    delay in bringing the application to set aside the Judgment. It is to be noted
                    that the appeal lapsed on 19 April 2010 but the application by the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    to set aside the Judgment was only filed on 9 September 2010. Indeed,
                    according to the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants, they claimed to have
                    “inklings of doubt” as regards the authenticity of the evidence as
                    early as December 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> They tried to

                    some documents:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>

                        pertaining to National. This was because, in April 2009, Ching Kwong Hoong
                        (KY Ching’s youngest brother) moved all documents pertaining to
                        National from National’s office to the office of Kwong Soon
                        Engineering company Pte Ltd, on the pretext of clearing the debris in
                        National’s office...when [the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                            9<sup>th</sup> Defendants] started searching for
                        National’s documents in December 2009 after doubt had been triggered,
                        they realised they no longer had access to those documents because Ching
                        Kwong Hoong, Sally, George Ching Chew Foon (Sally’s step-brother) and
                        Alan ran Kwong Soon Engineering Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This, in my view, was not a convincing reason.
                    It was all along open to the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants to apply to court for assistance
                    in procuring the relevant documents. Indeed, O 24 r 6 of the Rules of
                    Court allows for the application for discovery of documents before the
                    commencement of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Although I have found the purported reasons
                    for the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants’ absence from trial and the late application to be wholly
                    unconvincing, and some even to be disingenuous, it would still be necessary to
                    examine the allegations of fraud raised by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants. The statement of law propounded
                    in <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em> that the predominant consideration
                    in deciding whether to set aside a judgment under O 35 r 2 is the
                    reason for the defendant’s absence was intended to be of general
                    application. The situation is quite different when the application is founded on
                    actual fraud. In this regard, the authorities are clear that a judgment obtained
                    by fraud cannot be allowed to stand, as Denning LJ observed in <em>Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley</em> [1956] 1 QB 702
                    at 712:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he
                        has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can
                        be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. <em>Fraud unravels everything</em>. The court is careful not to find
                        fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it
                        vitiates judgments...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em> at [65] endorsed Denning LJ’s observations and set aside
                    the judgment even though the reasons furnished by the applicant to explain her
                    absence were found to be unconvincing. Here, Mr Hri Kumar, counsel for
                    the plaintiff, sensibly accepted that if there is clear and egregious fraud,
                    delay would not be an obstacle. As such, there was a need to examine the
                    specific allegations of fraud made by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants in relation to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s evidence in respect of
                    each of the trust assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Irreparable prejudice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As a matter of principle, it is
                    uncontroversial that the unavailability of any key witness to a re-trial is
                    typically a bar to setting aside a judgment whether regularly obtained or
                    obtained in default. This principle is illustrated by the decision of the
                    Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench in <em>Bank Canadian
                        National v Krause and Krause</em> (1979) 2 Man R (2d) 221
                        (“<em>Bank Canadian</em>”) at [14] –
                    [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[14]  Since mere delay need not be a bar to the
                            application unless there is an irreparable injury, I turn now to a
                            consideration of the prejudice that the plaintiff might suffer if the
                            default judgment is set aside...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[15]  
              <em>There is...[a] matter of
                                concern to which there is no satisfactory answer</em>.
                                <em>I refer to the intervening death of
                                Mr. Krause</em>. He was a co-defendant, and it is
                            apparent that he would have been a key witness. The loans at issue
                            related to his businesses, and it is clear from the affidavits of the
                            applicant that, if a trial of the action were to take place, Mr.
                            Krause's evidence would be required to establish facts and to assess
                            credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[16]  Counsel for the applicant has argued that since
                            Mr. Krause was a co-defendant, it is her client and not the
                            plaintiff who would be prejudiced. I cannot accept that argument. It is
                            wrong to assume that Mr. Krause's evidence would only benefit his
                            co-defendant. Examinations for discovery, and cross-examination of Mr.
                            Krause might well have been of great assistance to the plaintiff. To
                            deprive the plaintiff of these rights would be most unfair. <em>For this reason, I find that there is a real and
                                substantial risk of irreparable injury to the plaintiff in setting
                                aside the judgment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The case of <em>Bank
                        Canadian</em> concerned a default judgment and it applied with greater
                    force in the present case which concerned a regular judgment obtained following
                    a trial. From the decision, it was clear that real and substantial <em>risk</em> of irreparable prejudice to the plaintiff would
                    generally be sufficient to preclude the setting aside of the
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the Judgment, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was found to have held the
                    following assets on trust for KK Ching:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">One share in KK Holdings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">117,374 shares in National

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before examining the allegation of fraud in
                    respect of each of the assets listed above, it is useful to set out some
                    relevant information to place the entire case in its proper context. First, at
                    all material times, the plaintiff had openly asserted that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant held the above trust assets
                    for KK Ching. This was clearly stated in the letter of demand dated
                    28 April 2008, the Statement of Claim and his AEIC at the trial. I observe
                    here that the plaintiff’s evidence was corroborated by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s evidence both in her AEIC
                    and her oral testimony at the trial, as well as the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> defendant’s testimony. I was,
                    therefore, not concerned with a situation where findings were made from evidence
                    which had only emerged in the course of the trial. These assertions were clearly
                    stated from the outset even <em>prior</em> to the
                    institution of the legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Subsequent to the pronouncement of the
                    Judgment, the plaintiff passed away through illness on 4 March 2010. It is
                    obvious that any retrial, if ordered, could no longer involve the participation
                    of the plaintiff. The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants recognised that the demise of the
                    plaintiff was a serious impediment to the application. To avoid any issue of
                    irreparable prejudice, the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants submitted that it was the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant who had lied<sup></sup>in her AEIC and at the trial in relation<sup></sup>to the trust assets purportedly held by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. It should be emphasised that the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    made no allegation of fraud against the plaintiff. Instead, they submit that the
                    plaintiff’s evidence was entirely based on what the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant had told him about the trust assets
                    held by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, and since the
                    evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was allegedly tainted
                    by fraud, no weight should be attached to the plaintiff’s evidence
                    either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     However, the plaintiff’s evidence was
                    not limited only to the information provided to him by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The plaintiff testified that he
                    spoke to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who admitted to the
                    existence of the 1982 and 1984 Trusts and that the trust assets belonged to the
                    plaintiff. This was very clearly stated in [54] –
                    [55] of his AEIC dated 5 October
                    2009 which have been reproduced below for completeness:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54.    On or about 26 December, at my request, Sally
                            arranged for me to meet with Uncle Kwong Yew at the office of National
                            Aerated Singapore at 1177 Serangoon Road. <em>At this
                                meeting, Uncle Kwong Yew acknowledged and admitted to me the
                                existence of the 1982 Trusts and the 1984
                        Trusts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55.    
              <em>Uncle Kwong Yew further
                                acknowledged and admitted that Uncle Kwong Yew’s Trust Assets
                                belonged, and ought to be returned, to me. Uncle Kwong Yew, however,
                                explained that he did not want to effect the transfer of Uncle Kwong
                                Yew’s Trust Shares to me immediately, and would do so only
                                when he was ready</em>. Thereafter, Uncle Kwong Yew changed
                            the topic to something else, and our meeting ended on that note. I was
                            naturally disappointed that my attempt to have the assets transferred
                            back from Uncle Kwong Yew hit a brick wall. However, at that time, I was
                            still hopeful that Uncle Kwong Yew would voluntarily return Uncle Kwong
                            Yew’s Trust Assets to me, and therefore did not want to anger him,
                            or put him off, unnecessarily. Hence, I left the matter alone for the
                            time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants, however, alleged that the
                    plaintiff’s discussion with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    was in general terms and that no specific asset was discussed. This was
                    incorrect. In the plaintiff’s AEIC at [20(b)], he identified all the
                    assets which were held on trust by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.
                    In any event, even if the discussion was in general terms without reference to
                    any specific asset, the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants were not able to identify what
                    other trust assets the discussion related to. This aspect of the
                    plaintiff’s evidence was not challenged at the trial and was also not
                    challenged by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants in the present application. Based
                    on the plaintiff’s evidence, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    had admitted to the existence of the trust assets and that the trust assets
                        <em>ought to be returned</em> to the plaintiff,
                    although he told the plaintiff that he was not ready to transfer the assets at
                    that time. In my view, the plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence as regards
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s admission to the trust
                    assets was <em>fatal</em> to the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants’ application. This was so even if I were to disregard the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s evidence in its
                    entirety. It was clear that the Judgment was in part based on the unchallenged
                    evidence of the plaintiff that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had
                    acknowledged his obligation under the 1982 and 1984 Trusts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    Both the first defendant and the plaintiff
                            testified that between 1999 to 2007, they met several times with the
                            second defendant to recover Trust Assets (B). On those occasions,
                                <em>the second defendant acknowledged the existence
                                of both the 1982 Trust and the 1984 Trust in relation to Trust
                                Assets (B</em>). The second defendant acknowledged his
                            obligation under the 1984 Trust but said that he would transfer Trust
                            Assets (B) back to the plaintiff when he was ready without explaining
                            when that would be accomplished.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In the light of the <em>unchallenged
                                evidence</em>, I am satisfied that the second defendant was
                            instructed by KK Ching in 1984 to hold Trust Assets (B) (previously held
                            on trust for KK Ching under the 1982 Trust) on behalf of the
                            plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Finally, from the evidence, there could be no
                    doubt that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did hold various
                    assets on trust for KK Ching. The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant in
                    cross-examination testified that at the request of the plaintiff, he met the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and requested him to transfer
                    the trust assets back to the plaintiff and that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did not deny that he held
                    assets on trust for KK Ching. The material portion of his evidence at the trial
                    is reproduced in verbatim below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Thus the clear picture which emerged from the
                    evidence was that KK Ching wanted his relatives to hold assets on trust for
                    him. This was the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup>,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants. During the hearing before me, I quizzed Ms Barker that if the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did not hold the above assets on
                    trust for KK Ching, then what other assets did the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant hold on trust for him? She was
                    unable to provide any satisfactory explanation other than to say that the burden
                    was on the plaintiff to prove his case. However, it cannot be gainsaid that the
                    plaintiff had already proved his claims and had obtained judgment to that
                    effect. The burden was therefore on the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants to prove otherwise. The
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were plainly unable to discharge this burden given their case that no fraud was
                    alleged against the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The ambit of the fraud exception</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It ought to be emphasised here, that the
                    application before me was premised solely on allegations of fraud. The
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    did not submit that the Judgment can or should be set aside on any basis other
                    than fraud. During the hearing, the parties were <em>ad
                        idem</em> on the following principles:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     The burden was on the applicant to
                        prove that the Judgment was procured by actual fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     The fraud must strike at the root of
                        the litigation. In other words, the fraudulent evidence must be pivotal to
                        the findings made by the trial judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Where the parties departed, as is often the
                    case, was the proper interpretation of the fraud exception. What is the level of
                    proof required to establish fraud in order to set aside an otherwise regular
                    judgment? From my review of the authorities, it was clear that errors short of
                    fraud are insufficient to set aside a regular judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The requirements of establishing fraud in
                    order to set aside a judgment were succinctly summarised by the Supreme Court
                    (Court of Appeal) of New South Wales, Australia, in <em>Wentworth
                        v Rogers (No. 5)</em> (1986) 6 NSWLR 534 (per Kirby
                    J):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>First</em>, the essence of the action is fraud.
                        As in all actions based on fraud, <em>particulars of the
                            fraud claimed must be exactly given</em> and the allegations must
                        be established by the <em>strict proof</em> which such
                        a charge requires. <em>Jonesco v Beard</em>

                            Ltd</em> 119481 VLR 496, 497.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Secondly</em>, it must be shown, by the party
                        asserting that a judgment was procured by fraud, that there has been a
                            <em>new discovery</em> of <em>something material</em>, in the sense that fresh facts have been
                        found which, by themselves or in combination with previously known facts,
                            <em>would provide a reason for setting aside the
                            judgment</em>. See Lord Selborne LC in <em>Boswell
                            v Coaks (No 2)</em> (1894) 6 R 167. 170. 174: (1894)

                            Harper</em> 119131 VLR 311, 318. This rule has an ancient lineage.
                        See eg <em>Shedden v Patrick</em> (1854) 1 Macqueen
                        535, 615, 622; 26 Halsbury Laws of England (4th ed), para 560. It is based
                        upon a number of grounds. There is a public interest in finality of
                        litigation. Parties ought not, by proceeding to impugn a judgment, to be
                        permitted to relitigate matters which were the subject of the earlier
                        proceedings which gave rise to the judgment. Especially should they not be
                        so permitted, if they move on nothing more than the evidence upon which they
                        have previously failed. If they have evidence of fraud which may taint a
                        judgment of the courts, they should not collude in such a consequence by
                        refraining from raising their objection at the trial, thereby keeping the
                        complaint in reserve. It is their responsibility to ensure that the taint of
                        fraud is avoided and the integrity of the court's process preserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Thirdly</em>, mere suspicion of fraud, raised by
                        fresh facts later discovered, will not be sufficient to secure relief.
                            <em>Birch v Birch</em> [1902] P 130, 136, 139;
                            <em>McHarg v Woods Radio Pty Ltd</em> [1948] VLR
                        496, 498; <em>Ronald v Harper</em> [1913] VLR 311, 318.
                        The claimant must establish that the new facts are so evidenced and
                            <em>so material</em> that it is reasonably probable
                        that the action will succeed. This rule is founded squarely in the
                        public interest in finality of public litigation and in upholding judgments
                        duly entered at the termination of proceedings in the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Fourthly</em>, although perjury by the successful
                        party or a witness or witnesses may, if later discovered, warrant the
                        setting aside of a judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud, and
                        although there may be exceptional cases where such proof of perjury could
                        suffice, without more, to warrant relief of this kind, the mere allegation,
                        or even the proof of perjury will not normally be sufficient to attract such
                        drastic and exceptional relief as the setting aside of a judgment; <em>Cabassi v Vila</em> (1940) 64 CLR 130, 147, 148;
                            <em>Baker v Wadsworth</em> (1898) 67
                        LJ QB 301; <em>Everett v Ribbands</em> (1946)
                        175 LT 143, 145, 146. The other requirements must fulfilled. In
                        hard fought litigation, it is not at all uncommon for there to be a conflict
                        of testimony which has to be resolved by a judge or jury. In many cases, of
                        contradictory evidence, one party must be mistaken. He or she may even be
                        deceiving the court. The unsuccessful party in the litigation will often
                        consider that failure in the litigation has been procured by false evidence
                        on the part of the opponent and the witnesses called by the opponent. If
                        every case in which such an opinion was held gave rise to proceedings of
                        this kind, the courts would be even more burdened with the review of first
                        instance decisions than they are. For this reason, and in defence of
                        finality of judgments, a more stringent requirement than alleged perjury
                        alone is required.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Fifthly</em>, it must be shown by admissible
                        evidence that the successful party was responsible for the fraud which
                        taints the judgment under challenge. The evidence in support of the charge
                        ought to be extrinsic. Cf <em>Perry v Meddowcroft</em>
                        (1846) 10 Beau 122; 50 ER 529, 534, 535. It is not sufficient to show that
                        an agent of the successful party was convicted of giving perjured evidence
                        in the former proceeding, the result of which it is sought to impeach. It
                        must be shown that the agent, in so acting, was in concert with the party
                        who derived the benefit of the judgment. <em>Ronald v
                            Harper</em> [1913] VLR 311, 318; <em>Sheddon v
                            Patrick</em> (1854) 1 Macqueen 535, 643.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Sixthly</em>, the burden of establishing the
                        components necessary to warrant the drastic step of setting aside a
                        judgment, allegedly affected by fraud or other relevant taint, lies on
                        the party impugning the judgment. It is for that party to establish the
                        fraud and to do so clearly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, he or she must establish that the case is based on newly
                        discovered facts; that the facts are material and such as to make it
                        reasonably probable that the case will succeed; that they go beyond mere
                        allegations of perjury on the part of witnesses at the trial; and that the
                        opposing party who took advantage of the judgment is shown, by admissible
                        evidence, to have been responsible for the fraud in such a way as to render
                        it inequitable that such party should take the benefit of the
                        judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Court of Appeal in <em>Su
                        Sh-Hsyu</em> made pertinent observations to elaborate on the second
                    requirement as stated by Kirby J (the second requirement as stated above by
                    Kirby J coincided with the first and second requirements of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489 (“<em>Ladd v Marshall</em>”)). Although the court would, in
                    the interests of finality of judgments, generally expect the applicant alleging
                    fraud to adduce new evidence which could not have been discovered at the time of
                    trial with due diligence, this requirement ought not to be imposed rigidly such
                    as to cause injustice in a situation where the fresh evidence uncovers fraud on
                    the other party. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the fraud must
                    strike at the very root of the litigation (per V K Rajah JA at
                        [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the court should always bear in mind that its overriding constitutional
                        remit and objective is to promote, dispense and achieve justice between the
                        parties as well as uphold public confidence in the even-handed observance of
                        the rule of law. This objective is entirely consistent with the policy of
                            <em>finis litium</em>. As Laddie J has astutely
                        pointed out in <em>Saluja v Gill</em> (<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> <em>supra</em>), the justice of the case usually
                        requires the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions to be
                        applied strictly because it would be unfair to repeatedly subject a litigant
                        to retrial merely upon the discovery of new evidence. In a similar vein,
                            <em>finis litium</em> cannot be invariably and/or
                        rigidly imposed to such an extent that would allow a miscarriage of justice
                        to go uncorrected. In particular, where the fresh evidence uncovers the
                        fraud or deception of the other party, and such fraud <b><em>strikes at the very root of the litigation</em></b>, then, provided
                        the second and third conditions in <em>Ladd v
                            Marshall</em> are cumulatively satisfied, the court would, in
                        exceptional circumstances, be prepared to exercise measured flexibility in
                        relation to the application of the first <em>Ladd v
                            Marshall</em> condition (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> below). After all, a judgment that is corrupted at its
                        core by fraudulent conduct is tainted in its entirety, and the whole must
                        fail: <em>Hip Foong Hong v H Neotia and Company</em>
                        [1918] AC 888 at 894. However, we <b><em>emphasise
                            that the alleged fraud should strike at the very root of the
                            litigation</em></b> in the sense that the fresh evidence would be
                        crucial to, or determinative of, the final outcome to be ultimately reached
                        by the court.</p>

                    the <b><em>very root of the litigation</em></b> is reinforced by
                    the House of Lords’ holding in <em>Boswell v

                    aside if it were established by proof”. Even before this requirement is
                    considered, however, the applicant has to first discharge its burden of proving
                        <b><em>actual fraud</em></b>. If this burden is not
                    discharged, it would be superfluous to consider whether the alleged fraud (that
                    was not established) struck at the root of the litigation. As emphasised by the
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Patch v Ward</em> (1867
                    – 68) LR 3 Ch App 203 at p 212 (per Sir John Rolt LJ)
                        (“<em>Patch v Ward</em>”), this is not a
                    burden to be taken lightly:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the fraud must be actual positive fraud, a meditated and intentional
                        contrivance to keep the parties and the Court in ignorance of the real facts
                        of the case, and obtaining that decree by that contrivance. Mere
                        constructive fraud not originating in actual contrivance, but consisting of
                        acts tending possibly to deceive or mislead without any such intention or
                        contrivance, would probably not be sufficient...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As will be illustrated by the case authorities
                    discussed below, <em>dishonesty</em> is the cornerstone of
                    actual fraud (see also <em>United Overseas Bank Ltd v Bebe bte
                        Mohammad</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 884 at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Actual fraud must be shown</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The evidence presented by the party alleging
                    fraud may, upon a proper analysis, reveal a case of erroneous or misleading
                    evidence short of fraud. This would be so when the evidence was led erroneously
                    without any dishonest intention to mislead the court. The Malaysian High Court
                    in <em>Seng Huat Hang Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v Chee Seng &amp; Co Sdn
                        Bhd</em> [1987] 1 MLJ 413 (“<em>Seng
                        Huat Hang</em>”) held that the purported evidence of fraud in
                    that case was at most “misleading or even erroneous” but it fell
                    short of actual fraud. Chee Seng &amp; Co Sdn Bhd (“Chee Seng”)
                    had instituted proceedings against Seng Huat Hang Sdn Bhd (“Seng
                    Huat”) for possession of a number of bays comprised in various godowns.
                    Chee Seng stated in its Statement of Claim that it was the owner and landlord of
                    the godowns concerned, and that it was therefore entitled to possession. Seng
                    Huat admitted in its Defence that they were the tenants of the godowns liable to
                    pay monthly rent to Chee Seng, so long as Chee Seng was able to acquire a
                    Temporary Occupation Licence (“TOL”) from the Government of
                    Penang. Subsequent to the filing and service of the claim, Chee Seng’s
                    solicitors sent some correspondence to Seng Huat’s solicitors which were
                    apparently left unread. The correspondence actually showed that Chee Seng did
                    not have the requisite TOL. Subsequently Chee Seng applied for a consent order
                    in the Magistrate’s Court whereby Seng Huat was required to account for
                    monthly rent. Seng Huat’s solicitors consented on its behalf. Chee
                    Seng’s supporting affidavit averred that Seng Huat had admitted in its
                    Defence that they were liable to pay a monthly rent to Chee Seng. It appears
                    that no mention was made as regards the lack of the requisite TOL. On the date
                    of hearing, neither Seng Huat nor its solicitors were present and default
                    judgment for possession was duly entered in favour of Chee Seng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Thereafter, Seng Huat discovered that Chee
                    Seng did not possess the requisite TOL. It applied for a declaration that the
                    possession orders made by the Magistrate’s Court had been fraudulently
                    obtained by wilful concealment from the court of the material fact that the
                    State Authority did not issue the TOL to Chee Seng, and that the orders were
                    therefore null and void. The Malaysian High Court found that the correspondence
                    (which showed that Chee Seng did not have the requisite TOL) sent by Chee
                    Seng’s solicitors well before the Magistrate Court action showed that
                    there was no deliberate fraud on Chee Seng’s part. In that context, Chee
                    Seng’s failure to disclose its lack of title was at most misleading or
                    erroneous. In particular, Edgar Joseph Jr J held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have already observed that the [correspondence] made it clear that [Chee
                        Seng]`s Temporary Occupation Licence had expired or, at the very least,
                        should have put [Seng Huat] on enquiry that this was so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yet, [Seng Huat’s] solicitors took no step whatsoever to write to
                        the Land Office for confirmation as to the date of its expiry. Had they done
                        so, no doubt, they would have been informed that it had expired on 31
                        December 1978 and had not since been renewed. What were the reasons for this
                        inaction?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">None was vouchsafed to this court, although during the argument counsel
                        for [Seng Huat] was queried by me on this very point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, the [correspondence] which were received by [Seng
                        Huat’s] solicitors, well before the hearing of the Magistrate`s Court
                        Actions, puts paid to the argument that the present defendant was guilty of
                            a<b><em> deliberate fraud</em></b> as alleged or at all.
                        Although they were armed with the facts appearing in the [correspondence],
                        [Seng Huat] did nothing to verify their contents or to amend their defence
                        to challenge [Chee Seng’s] title to sue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...having regard to the [correspondence], the failure on the part of [Chee
                        Seng] to disclose its want of title in the Magistrate`s Court Actions may,
                        at most, <em>have been misleading or even erroneous but it
                            falls far short of the requirements of deliberate fraud</em>
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows, therefore, that far from there being a strong case, there was
                        not an iota of evidence of fraud on the part of [Chee Seng] as alleged
                        or at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics added; emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The observations above are consistent with the
                    general principle stated by the Malaysian Court of Appeal in <em>Chee Pok Choy &amp; Ors v Scotch Leasing Sdn Bhd</em> [2001]
                    4 MLJ 346 (“<em>Chee Pok
                    Choy</em>”) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…a judgment may be impeached for deliberate fraud practised upon
                        the court, and it is insufficient to show that a litigant merely convinced
                        the court through <em>misleading or erroneous
                            evidence</em>. Whether the test has been met in any given case
                        must, I think, depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Malaysian Court of Appeal also endorsed
                    the observations in <em>Satish Chandra v Satish Kantha
                        Roy</em> [1923] AIR 73 at p 76 that mere suspicion or
                    conjecture is insufficient to establish fraud to set aside a judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Charges of fraud and collusion like those contained in the plaint in this

                        together as a whole. <em>Suspicions and surmises and
                            conjecture are not permissible substitutes for those facts or those

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Chee Pok
                    Choy</em>, the appellant-applicant’s evidence of fraud was not
                    challenged by the respondent. The court held that the trial judge had wrongly
                    decided that there was no fraud given that he did not investigate or scrutinise
                    the allegations of fraud, as he ought to have.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It was emphasised in <em>Price
                        v Stone</em> [1964] VR 106 (“<em>Price</em>”) that there must be something more than false
                    evidence in order to establish actual fraud. The Supreme Court of Victoria,
                    Australia, held that a witness’s <em>accidental</em>
                    or <em>inadvertent</em> swearing of false evidence does not
                    amount to deliberate fraud. In <em>Price</em>,
                    Mrs Stone had been a lodger at Mrs Price’s house, and had placed
                    several belongings in the latter’s home. After Mrs Stone moved out,
                    she claimed that she had left some furniture at Mrs Price’s place. At
                    trial during cross-examination, Mrs Stone stated that she did not sign a
                    document which purported to be a list of furniture which Mrs Price alleged
                    was provided by Mrs Stone as a receipt of the goods taken. Mrs Stone
                    also testified during cross-examination that she was not present when the movers
                    came to load the furniture, contrary to Mrs Price’s allegation.
                    Judgment was granted in favour of Mrs Stone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Subsequently, Mrs Price applied to set
                    aside the judgment on the ground that Mrs Stone had committed perjury, as
                    it appeared that the furniture movers could give evidence to prove that
                    Mrs Stone was present when they loaded the furniture. The Supreme Court
                    held that the <em>inadvertent</em> giving of false evidence
                    at most goes to affect the <em>credibility</em> of the
                    witness; it does not equate to deliberate fraud. To prove the latter, it must be
                    shown that the witness had a predetermined intention to mislead the court, which
                    was not found to be the case. Gillard J held (at 109 – 110):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the action is for fraud, <em>something not merely
                            incidental or accidental</em>, but deliberate and
                        intended...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...In my opinion, it is difficult in these circumstances to imply from
                        false evidence led from a party by the other party’s counsel [in
                        cross-examination] that there was a fraud on the court. <em>There must be something more than the false evidence. The false
                            swearing must be deliberate and designed, not merely
                            adventitious</em>in the course of trial...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…If the carrier witnesses had been called to prove Mrs Stone
                        was present when the goods were loaded onto their truck, <em>such evidence could have reflected greatly on Mrs Stone’s
                            credit</em>, but the ultimate issue would still have been, did she
                        receive the goods…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the plaintiff must prove that a fraud was perpetrated on the court
                        by Mrs Stone. I do not believe the present plaintiff has demonstrated a
                        likelihood of doing this in these proceedings. Mrs Stone’s
                        denials, if any, were probably made casually, <em>without any
                            predetermined intention to mislead the court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     From the above, it is clear that <em>falsity</em> due to inadvertence, without more, does not
                    amount to fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It would seem that the Privy Council’s
                    decision of <em>Hip Foong Hong v H Neotia and Company</em>
                    [1918] AC 888 (“<em>Hip Foong
                    Hong</em>”) suggests the principle that a party’s failure to
                    adduce evidence to corroborate <em>the opponent’s
                        case</em> does not amount to fraudulent conduct that taints a
                    judgment. In <em>Hip Foong Hong</em>, the respondents had a
                    dispute over a sale of goods transaction with the appellants. The appellants
                    sued the respondents for non-delivery of goods, while the respondents alleged
                    that the relevant contract had already been terminated. After the
                    appellants’ claim was dismissed, the appellants filed a motion for a new
                    trial of its action on the ground that the judgment had been obtained by fraud.
                    The appellants asserted that the respondents had failed to adduce certain
                    documentary evidence in their possession which showed that there was an existing
                    contract between the parties at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The <em>corroborative</em> nature of the undisclosed evidence is evident from
                    Lord Buckmaster’s explanation at p 892 that the undisclosed evidence
                    added nothing beyond a mere repetition of evidence that was already adduced by
                    the appellants, and that the evidence did not disclose any new fact:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was alleged at the hearing that no other books existed beyond those
                        disclosed bearing on this matter; and it is plain that this book was
                            <em>material</em> and should have been produced. It
                        must, however, be remembered that it <em>added nothing beyond
                            a repetition</em> of the statements made on February 17, 1913 - a
                        circumstance which, as has already been pointed out, the learned judge had
                        fully and duly weighed in arriving at his conclusion, and <em>the production of this book discloses no new fact</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the final analysis, the Privy Council was
                    of the view that the respondents’ failure to adduce the evidence did not
                    amount to fraud. This was so even though the evidence was found to be
                    material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Further, it is pertinent that the erroneous
                    insistence on rights based on an <em>opinion</em> or an
                    inference that was fairly and reasonably reached does not amount to fraud
                    either. This remained so even if it was subsequently found, with hindsight, that
                    the inference or opinion was overstated or overestimated. This principle can be
                    gleaned from the case of <em>Patch v Ward</em> which
                    concerned two mortgages over a property. Ward was the solicitor for the second
                    mortgagee. In May 1847, a bill was filed by the first mortgagee for foreclosure.
                    In October 1847, the mortgagor signed an authority for the tenants to pay
                    to Ward their rents due. Ward would at times receive the rent in his own name,
                    and at times receive rent in the second mortgagee’s name. Subsequently,
                    Ward became the equitable owner of the first and second mortgage by making
                    payment to the first and second mortgagees. Although the payment to the first
                    mortgagee was funded by Ward, it was made in the second mortgagee’s name
                    such that it seemed that it was the second mortgagee who had redeemed the first
                    mortgage. Before an order absolute for foreclosure was made, a supporting
                    affidavit was filed in the second mortgagee’s name which stated that the
                    mortgagor has failed to make payment of the whole outstanding sum of £6870
                    to the second mortgagee. An order absolute for foreclosure was made on the
                    strength of this affidavit. The mortgagor was absent during the proceedings
                    leading up to the order absolute as he was overseas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Subsequently, the mortgagor sought to set
                    aside the order for foreclosure as having been obtained by fraud. According to
                    the mortgagor, he had indeed paid the sum of £161 as rent to Ward, and that
                    this rent was received by the second mortgagee. As such, the assertion in the
                    second mortgagee’s affidavit that the whole sum of £6870 was unpaid
                    was false and untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     According to Ward’s case, he had become
                    the equitable owner of the first two mortgages when he made payment towards
                    them. In addition, he had a third equitable charge over the same property under
                    a memorandum signed in October 1847 where the mortgagor agreed that Ward would
                    receive payment of rent. Ward had admitted to the receipt of £161 as rent,
                    but he applied them not towards the first or second mortgage, but towards the
                    third equitable charge which he obtained from the mortgagor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Court of Appeal held that Ward had acted
                    on his own <em>opinion</em>, and that it was one which was
                    fair and reasonable. Although Ward might have insisted on rights which were
                    subsequently found to be overstated, it did not constitute fraud. Lord
                    Cairns LJ held at pp 207 and 210:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I apprehend the fraud...must be fraud which you can explain and define
                        upon the face of a decree, and that ... <em>the insisting
                            upon rights which, upon a due investigation of those rights, might be
                            found to be overstated or overestimated</em>, is not the kind of
                        fraud which will authorize the Court to set aside a solemn decision which
                        has assumed the form of a decree signed and enrolled...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it might have been argued that <em>Ward</em>,
                        having legitimately become owner of the first and second mortgages, and
                        having an undisputed subsequent equitable charge, had the right to tack his
                        third charge to his first and second, and to hold everything which the first
                        and second gave him for the purpose of procuring payment, as far as he
                        could, also of his third charge, and that if this receipt of rents was
                        originally destined for the security of payment of [the second mortgagee],
                        Mr. <em>Ward</em> by becoming the transferee of [the
                        second mortgagee] became also the transferee of the right to receive the
                        rents, and that as [the mortgagor] could have taken nothing away from
                            <em>Ward</em> without satisfying fully every part
                        of every security which <em>Ward</em> held, <em>Ward</em> would be justified in applying the rents
                        subsequently received in discharge, not of the first or second mortgage, but
                        of the third. It is not necessary to consider which of those two views must
                        have prevailed, because, in my opinion, <em>Ward might fairly
                            entertain the opinion that the view upon which he acted was the right
                            and true view in point of law. I think it was an opinion that any
                            person, whether a professional man or not, might fairly be supposed to
                            entertain, and that it would be going far beyond any conclusion which
                            the Court is authorized to draw from the facts, to say that a person who
                            acted upon that opinion was influenced by any fraudulent motive or
                            design towards the mortgagor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In examining whether fraud was established, I
                    adopted the principle of law from my review of the cases that dishonesty is the
                    cornerstone for fraud. Indeed, the case authorities have shown that inadvertent
                    errors in the evidence, the drawing of wrong inferences, conjectures, lack of
                    corroborative evidence or even <em>false</em> evidence
                        (<em>ie incorrect</em> evidence) short of actual and
                    deliberate fraud would not be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof. To
                    hold otherwise would mean that the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants would effectively be permitted to
                    proceed with the application as if it was an appeal. In the cases where fraud
                    was found to justify the setting aside of the judgment, they typically involved
                    objective evidence to establish actual fraud as in <em>Su Sh
                        Hsyu</em> where the fresh evidence in the form of a scientific report
                    from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on its face suggested
                    that the deposit slip evidencing payment of the shares contained the genuine
                    signature of the respondent. The respondent who had alleged that he did not
                    receive any payment, however, did not adduce any evidence to contradict the
                    findings by the HSA. If the HSA report were established to be accurate, it would
                    follow that the respondent had perjured on the question of payment which went to
                    the root of the case. Furthermore, the high threshold in establishing fraud can
                    also be seen in the decision of <em>Chee Pok Choy</em>,
                    where the respondent was found to have <em>actively
                        concealed</em> the fact that it was a licensed moneylender. If the
                    respondent’s status had not been concealed, it was required under several
                    statutory provisions to provide specific information and particulars of the
                    loan. The non-compliance of such provisions rendered the respondent’s
                    originating summons a nullity. The Court also found that the respondent had
                        <em>deliberately misled</em> the court into making the
                    relevant order for sale. In such circumstances, actual fraud was established and
                    the order for foreclosure was consequently set aside. Likewise, the exceptional
                    circumstances of finding actual fraud can be seen in <em>SP
                        Chengalvaraya Naidu v Jagannath</em> AIR 1994 SC 853
                        (“<em>SP Chengalvaraya</em>”) where
                    Jagannath had purchased a property on behalf of Chunilal at a court auction. The
                    latter had obtained a decree against the appellants (judgment debtor), and the
                    court sale was made in execution of the said decree. The appellants paid the
                    full decretal amount to Chunilal. By a registered deed, Jagannath relinquished
                    all his rights in the property to Chunilal. However, without disclosing that he
                    had executed the release deed, Jagannath filed a suit for partition of the
                    property and obtained a preliminary decree. The appellants were not aware that
                    Jagannath had no <em>locus standi</em> to file the suit as
                    he had already executed a registered release deed and relinquished his rights in
                    the property to Chunilal. In this regard, the <em>very
                        basis</em> for which the preliminary decree was procured was found to
                    be missing. The Supreme Court of India found that there was “<em>no manner of doubt</em>” that the situation was one of
                    fraud which was opined as “an act of <em>deliberate
                        deception</em> with the design of securing something by taking unfair
                    advantage of another”, and “<em>a deception in
                        order to gain</em> by another’s loss[;] ... <em>a
                        cheating intended to get an advantage</em>”. See <em>SP Chengalvaraya</em> at [6]. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s decision
                    that the decree was obtained by fraud and was consequently a
                nullity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In my view, there is a clear and rational
                    reason for imposing such a high standard of proof on an applicant such as the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    to establish actual and deliberate fraud. In the usual course of events, if a
                    party is dissatisfied with a decision, typically an appeal is filed to prove
                    that it was wrongly decided. If fresh evidence is to be adduced in support of
                    the appeal, such an applicant is required to satisfy the stringent test laid
                    down in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>. There can be no doubt
                    that the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants would not have satisfied the first requirement laid down in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> given that the fresh evidence which they
                    had sought to adduce to prove the alleged fraud comprise essentially the share
                    registers of the companies which would have been available at the trial with the
                    exercise of a modicum of due diligence. It is also uncontroversial that although
                    the civil standard of proving on a balance of probabilities applies, the Court
                    has a higher expectation of proof when it comes to allegations as serious as
                    that of fraud, as was decided by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tang
                        Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and
                        others</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As I have observed above, the fact that the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    did not challenge the plaintiff’s evidence was fatal to the application.
                    That alone was sufficient to dispose of the application. Nonetheless, I reviewed
                    the evidence in relation to each of the above trust assets and arrived at the
                    determination that the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants had failed to discharge their
                    burden to prove actual and deliberate fraud in respect of any of the trust
                    assets which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was found to have held
                    on trust for KK Ching. The challenge mounted by the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants extended to each of the assets
                    which were found to be held on trust by the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant for KK Ching. They alleged that each of the findings was tainted by
                    fraud. They sought to rely on the following “<em>fresh
                        evidence</em>” to show that the Judgment was procured by the
                        “<em>perjured evidence</em>” of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant:</p>

                    to KK Holdings and National Aerated was not as strong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">KK Holdings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     There were altogether four shares issued in KK
                    Holdings. The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants submitted that the one share in
                    KK Holdings was not <em>transferred</em> from KK Ching to
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in 1982 as alleged by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Instead, from the share register
                    of KK Holdings adduced by the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants, one share was <em>allotted</em> to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    in 1982. It is pertinent to note that at the same time one share was also
                        <em>allotted</em> to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant. Nonetheless, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant testified
                    erroneously in [23] of her own AEIC that
                    KK Ching had <em>transferred</em> his shares to various
                    parties which included the one share that was actually <em>allotted</em> to her under the 1982 Trust. Therefore, taking the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants’ case at its highest, at best the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant had merely made an error in
                    using the word “transfer” instead of “allot” in her
                    evidence. Significantly, she made the same error in respect of the one share
                    which she acknowledged was held on trust for KK Ching. In my view, the burden of
                    proving fraud cannot be discharged by pointing out the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s inadvertent use of
                    imprecise language.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants further alleged that apart from
                    the allotted share, the other share held by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant in KK Holdings was transferred to her by Ching Kwong Hoong and not by
                    KK Ching, and that this would suggest that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant could not have held that share on trust for KK Ching. If this were
                    right, that would logically mean that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant also held one share in KK Holdings on trust for Ching Kwong
                    Hoong. However, to-date Ching Kwong Hoong (who is still alive) has notably not
                    come forward to claim the one share in KK Holdings. Further, the
                        4<sup>th</sup> defendant had also admitted that she held the
                    balance one share in KK Holdings on trust for KK Ching. In fact this merely went
                    to prove that all the four shares in KK Holdings were at all material times held
                    on trust for KK Ching. It was probably no coincidence that KK Holdings bore the
                    initials of KK Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I therefore held that there was no fraud
                    whatsoever in the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in
                    relation to the one share in KK Holdings that I found was held by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on trust for KK
                Ching.</p>

                “National Aerated”)</p>

                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ case was that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s evidence in relation to
                    National Aerated was fraudulent because the shares were not transferred to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in 1982. Instead, from the share
                    register of National Aerated, they were only transferred from KK Ching to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in 1985. To understand this error,
                    it was necessary to note that it was never disputed that KK Ching was the
                    registered owner of 62,250 shares as at 3 October 1981. At that time, the
                    shareholding of National Aerated was as follows:</p>

                    (1 for 1 share) was made on 8 January 1982. KK Ching, like the other
                    shareholders (except the Yap family who did not subscribe), was allotted one
                    share in National Aerated for every one share owned. Consequently, KK Ching was
                    issued with a further 62,250 shares. A further 38,350 shares were allotted to KK
                    Ching from an excess rights issue in February 1982. On 15 October 1982, KK Ching
                    transferred 62,250 shares to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to
                    hold on trust for him. On 8 July 1985, KK Ching transferred his balance 101,100
                    shares (a sum of 62,250 and 38850 shares) in National Aerated to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. Arising from the above, it could
                    at best be said that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant made an
                    error in stating that the transfer of KK Ching’s shares in National
                    Aerated to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant occurred in 1982 instead
                    of 1985.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In 1989, the Yap family shares in National
                    Aerated were acquired by the Ching family and the
                    2<sup>nd</sup> defendant distributed the Yap family shares
                    to the members of the Ching family in proportion to their respective
                    shareholdings in the company. Following the acquisition, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant distributed 10,020 National
                    Aerated shares to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in respect of the
                    62,250 shares which she was holding on trust for KK Ching. A total of
                    16,274 shares were proportionately distributed to the 101,100 shares held
                    on trust by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for KK Ching, thus
                    making the total number of shares held on trust to be 117,374 shares (a sum of
                    16,274 and 101,100 shares).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Before me, the 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants also sought to prove that the
                    shares owned by KK Ching in National Aerated were actually paid by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and hence the shares could not have
                    been held on trust for KK Ching. This was based on a journal maintained by the
                    bookkeeper of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. It was unclear how
                    this journal was relevant to the allegation of fraud, given that the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    have not disputed the fact that at the time when the plaintiff and
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant gave evidence at the trial,
                    they had no access to the financial journal. More pertinently, I found that the
                    entries in the journal were inconclusive and at best equivocal. They certainly
                    did not prove that the National Aerated shares registered in KK Ching’s
                    name were paid by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. In particular,
                    the journal entry dated 12 January 1982 merely stated “NAWC [Rights
                        Issue]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>”, while the entry dated 11
                    February 1982 stated “NAWC (KK Ching Excess Shares)”. These
                    entries do not conclusively show that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant had paid for the 62,250 shares and could equally be consistent with
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant making payment on behalf of KK
                    Ching. In any event, the entry for “NAWC [Rights Issue]” reflected
                    a payment of $152,250, and not $62,250. Furthermore, with regard to the entry
                    which stated “NAWC (KK Ching Excess Shares)”, the very same
                    language was used in respect of the payment for the shares in the
                        6<sup>th</sup> defendant’s name, as the journal entry
                    also dated 11 February 1982 stated “NAWC ([Zhaoliang]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Excess
                    Shares)”; yet it was not asserted that the 6<sup>th</sup>
                    defendant was holding these shares on behalf of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. Lastly, in view that both the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the bookkeeper have since
                    passed away, the Court would not be assisted on whether the journal was genuine,
                    accurate or complete, and even on the proper interpretation of the entries
                    therein. As such, there remained unresolved doubts on the reliability and
                    accuracy of the journal. For example, although the journal entry dated 20 April
                    1982 stated “NAWC [Change to Cash]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>”, there was no
                    corresponding record of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant liquidating
                    his National Aerated shares during this period. This demonstrated the
                    questionable accuracy and completeness of the journal entries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     If KK Ching had indeed held his shares in
                    National Aerated on trust for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, KK
                    Ching would be the only brother in the Ching family who had no beneficial
                    interest in the shares of National Aerated. The 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants were not able to provide any
                    conceivable explanation to account for this improbable discrepancy in the
                    familial distribution of shares. In any event, even if the shares had been paid
                    by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, this would at most go to
                    the merits of the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ case which properly
                    belonged as an issue for the trial or an appeal subject to compliance with the
                    test in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>. Further, Mr Hri Kumar
                    drew my attention to the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant’s
                        2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit wherein he alleged that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had complained that the other
                    members of the Ching family had not repaid him for the monies spent for the Yap
                    family shares. By their own case, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    treated the payment as a loan to his family members which would displace the
                    contention that KK Ching had held the National Aerated shares on trust for him.
                    In my view, these allegations do not even come close to establishing fraud in
                    the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in relation to
                    the National Aerated shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">$1 million cash</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Put simply, the 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ case was that no documentary
                    evidence was adduced by the plaintiff to prove the existence of the trust in
                    respect of the $1 million cash. The finding was based on the evidence of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Since the evidence of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant in relation to KK Holdings and
                    National Aerated was purportedly unreliable, her evidence in relation to the $1
                    million should likewise be tainted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the present case, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    contended that no documentary evidence was adduced by the plaintiff to prove the
                    existence of the trust in respect of the $1 million cash. However, the
                    production of any such documentary evidence <em>would not have
                        disclosed any new fact</em>. The only function of any such documentary
                    evidence would have been to <em>corroborate</em> the
                    plaintiff’s position. It could hardly be said that the non-disclosure of
                    evidence which would not have disclosed any new fact could constitute actual
                    fraud. Furthermore, to the extent that the Privy Council in <em>Hip Foong Hong</em> had opined that a party’s failure to
                    disclose corroborative evidence to support the <em>opponent’s case</em> does not amount to fraud, it is all the
                    more so in the case of non-production of evidence to corroborate <em>one’s own case</em>. This claim was asserted by the
                    plaintiff from the very outset in the letter of demand. The absence of
                    corroborative evidence was apparent to the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants from the outset. This point could
                    have been raised at the trial and the relevant witnesses (<em>ie</em> the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant) cross-examined on it. The failure to produce corroborative evidence
                    was not tantamount to actual fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In further support, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9 defendants produced the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s UOB bank statements to show
                    that there was no deposit of $1 million in 1982. This was an argument on the
                    merits which should and could have been raised at the trial. In any event, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants’ argument did not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the
                    evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in relation to the
                    $1 million trust was necessarily fraudulent. During the hearing,
                    Ms Barker accepted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant might
                    well have other bank accounts which have not been disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Seng Heng Realty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I come to the 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants’ case in respect of the Seng
                    Heng Realty shares which Ms Barker described as their strongest case. They
                    submitted that the plaintiff’s evidence that KK Ching had transferred
                    32,000 shares in Seng Heng Realty to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant under the 1982 trusts was fraudulent. They pointed out that since the
                    company records showed that KK Ching did not at any time prior to his death own
                    any shares in Seng Heng Realty, it was not possible for KK Ching to have
                    transferred any shares in Seng Heng Realty to the
                    2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The allotment of shares in Seng Heng Realty
                    was a general familial arrangement to distribute to each brother an
                    approximately equal share in the company. The shares were distributed in 1975
                    and the Ching brothers held 32,000 shares each but the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant held twice the amount of shares
                    which totalled 64,001 shares. The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants offered no explanation as to why
                    KK Ching would be excluded from this familial arrangement, and why the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would hold twice the amount of
                    shares held by the other brothers individually. The fact that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the original shareholder in
                    Seng Heng Realty did not explain the difference as Ching Kwong Lum, who was the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s father and one of the
                    original shareholders together with the
                    2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, was distributed the same number
                    of shares (32,000 shares) as the other Ching brothers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants submitted that the evidence of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant in [21] of her AEIC, where she explained that she became aware of
                    the transfer of shares (which included the Seng Heng Realty shares) in the
                    course of updating the register of shareholders for these companies, was false
                    because the shares in Seng Heng Realty were never registered in KK Ching’s
                    name in the first place and hence no question of transfer arose. It was
                    therefore suggested that if she had indeed updated the register of Seng Heng
                    Realty, she would have realised that KK Ching had not at any time held shares in
                    Seng Heng Realty. This allegation, however, presupposed that that was the only
                    reason the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant came to know of the trust
                    assets including the Seng Heng Realty shares held by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. She had indeed come to know
                    of the trust assets from several other sources, none of which were challenged.

                    received the sum of $2,113,398.18 on trust (referred to as “Seng Heng

                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    relied on an affidavit filed by Ms Chua Hwee Kiang as liquidator in the
                    voluntary liquidation of Seng Heng Realty which was filed in response to a
                    discovery order obtained by the plaintiff before the trial. The
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    purported to rely on Ms Chua’s affidavit to support their contention
                    that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did not receive any part of
                    the Seng Heng monies. If it was not received by the

                        5<sup>th</sup> to

                    evidencing the respective amount of funds returned to each of the shareholders
                    of Seng Heng Realty. Ms Chua stopped short of saying that she has never
                    seen them or that payments to the shareholders of Seng Heng Realty never took
                    place. I emphasise that the burden was on the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                        9<sup>th</sup> defendants to prove that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did not receive the Seng Heng
                    monies, and that any evidence which asserted otherwise must necessarily be
                    fraudulent or tainted with fraud. They did not discharge this burden by simply
                    raising the unlikely possibility that the Seng Heng monies may not have been
                    received by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. If so, the monies
                    must be still in Seng Heng Realty but no evidence to that effect was adduced by
                    the 5<sup>th</sup> to
                    9<sup>th</sup> defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In the final analysis, I found that the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    had failed to adduce sufficient or cogent evidence to establish fraud in
                    relation to any of the trust assets. In fact, the 5<sup>th</sup>
                    to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants had referred to matters which dealt
                    with the merits of issues which have been conclusively decided, rather than
                    challenging the authenticity of evidence relied upon. The
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    have also attempted to disguise a challenge on the sufficiency of evidence as
                    equivalent to a challenge to its authenticity. Any attempt to reargue the merits
                    of the case in the guise of allegations of fraud is, in my view, an abuse of
                    process. It was also obvious that the documents relied upon by the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants,
                    such as the company records of KK Holdings, the share register of National
                    Aerated and the doubtful financial journal purportedly maintained by an unnamed
                    bookkeeper for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, had existed at the
                    time of the trial and were clearly accessible to the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    either through their own means or through an application to the Court. To set
                    aside the Judgment would be tantamount to permitting the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    to challenge or disregard the evidence of the plaintiff. As he had since
                    unfortunately passed away, the prejudice to the plaintiff and now his estate
                    could not be compensated by any cost order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Furthermore, in the stay application filed by
                    the 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    on 26 February 2010, it was stated in the supporting affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> that they have
                    procured documentary evidence from the National Aerated Share Register and the
                    1982 financial journal, to show that the transfer of shares had allegedly taken
                    place in 1985 instead of 1982, and that the shares issued to KK Ching were paid
                    for by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. Although the <em>same arguments</em> based on the <em>same
                        documents</em> (with regard to disputes over the shares in National
                    Aerated) were made as in the present application before me, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    conspicuously did not <em>make any allegation of fraud</em>
                    for the stay application. Instead, in the same supporting affidavit, they merely
                    stated that they “verily believe that there are <em>merits</em> to [their] appeal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In
                    these circumstances, it was manifestly evident that even the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were themselves not convinced that there was fraud involved notwithstanding
                    their access to the purported “new evidence” in the form of
                    National Aerated’s Share Register and the 1982 financial journal. The
                    application to set aside the Judgment on grounds of fraud was clearly an
                    afterthought contrived as an attempt to revive the case after having allowed
                    their appeal to lapse. At the highest, by their own case, the
                    “new” evidence would merely establish that there might be some
                    “merits” in their appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     One of the reasons proffered by the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    to explain their absence from the trial was their lack of personal knowledge of
                    the alleged trusts and their belief that they “<em>would
                        be unable to make any meaningful contribution to the
                    proceedings</em>”. However, everything that they have now alleged
                    in their attempt to set aside the Judgment were matters which they could have
                    raised at the trial and, more importantly, when the plaintiff was still alive.
                    In the context of the required threshold to set aside the Judgment, the
                        5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> defendants
                    were indeed unable to make any meaningful contribution. They made a conscious
                    and deliberate judgment call and “<em>buried their heads
                        in the sand</em>” (see <em>Shocked</em> at
                    p 382) when they had the opportunity to properly contest the claims. Under
                    such circumstances, the observations of Browne-Wilkinson VC in <em>Craddock v Barber</em> [1986] CA (19 February
                    1986) that: “<em>I [can] see no manifest injustice in not
                        offering him a second opportunity</em>”, are particularly
                    apposite. To do the contrary would result in manifest injustice to the plaintiff
                    and now his estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Accordingly, I dismissed both applications
                    with costs which I fixed at $40,000 excluding disbursements.</p>
