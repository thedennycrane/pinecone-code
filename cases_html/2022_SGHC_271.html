</div>
</div> The plaintiff’s case is that he had invested in the first defendant in reliance of and being induced by the second defendant’s representations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In particular, the plaintiff alleged that the second defendant had provided the plaintiff with the terms and conditions for the subscription of preference shares in the first defendant which were set out in a Private Placement Memorandum dated 1 February 2009 (the “Memorandum”). The second defendant had done so at a marketing event held in Beijing, the People’s Republic of China in 2009. In addition, the plaintiff also alleged that the second defendant had orally informed him that the terms set out in the Memorandum would govern his investment and that the investment would be principal-guaranteed (exclusive of management fee). The second defendant’s representations were allegedly consistent with the terms of the Memorandum, which, among others, provided that the plaintiff is entitled to receive the sum of $1,237,500 together with any investment returns and accrued interest by 15 March 2016.

The defendants later denied that the investments in the first defendant were principal-guaranteed. The plaintiff therefore brought an action in Suit 1175 against the defendants in misrepresentation and/or unlawful means conspiracy. The plaintiff alleged that his loss amounted to $1,500,000, which is the amount of his investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Importantly for the present application, Suit 1175 was commenced against the first defendant on 13 November 2019. Mr Li was then added as the second defendant on 11 May 2020. After a series of interlocutory applications filed by the parties, both the plaintiff and the defendants were ready for trial by February 2022. In fact, on 7 April 2022, the Assistant Registrar directed the parties to exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief by 7 June 2022, and for trial to be fixed for six days in August 2022.

</div>
</div> I had heard that application on 5 August 2022 and ordered the first defendant to be wound up (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Song </span><span class="font-italic">Jianbo v Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd </span>[2022] SGHC 229 at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 With the above background in mind, I turned to the applicable law. In this regard, s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the IRDA (“s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii)”) provides that the court’s permission is needed for legal proceedings to proceed against a bankrupt. Section 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Effect of bankruptcy order</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">327.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—(1)  On the making of a bankruptcy order —</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) unless otherwise provided by Parts 3 and 13 to 22 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(i) no creditor to whom the bankrupt is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy has any remedy against the person or property of the bankrupt in respect of that debt; and</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(ii) no action or proceedings may be proceeded with or commenced against the bankrupt in respect of that debt,</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">except by the permission of the Court and in accordance with such terms as the Court may impose.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Section 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is largely identical with s 76(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the now repealed Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed). However, despite both provisions having been part of Singapore law for a considerable period of time, there has not been a local decision explaining in detail how a court is to exercise its discretion to grant permission for legal proceedings to proceed against a bankrupt. As such, I had to consider the policy behind the need for permission in outlining some relevant factors to guide my exercise of discretion to grant permission under s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The policy behind the need for permission for legal proceedings to proceed against a bankrupt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I turned first to the policy behind the need to apply for permission for legal proceedings to proceed against a bankrupt. In this regard, the Court of Appeal recently had occasion to comment on the purpose of s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hoa and other appeals and other matters</span> [2021] 2 SLR 584 at [68]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The rationale behind the provision is to prevent a scramble of creditors going after the bankrupt and potentially violating the <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>principle of distribution, which is a key pillar of our insolvency regime. That is why the provision confers on the court the discretion to grant leave, where appropriate, for such proceedings to continue, and to <span class="font-italic">impose conditions </span>to manage such litigation. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Moreover, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Bank v Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Keh Lam </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 219 also observed (at [35]), albeit in relation to the predecessor section of s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the IRDA, that is, s 76(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 1996 Rev Ed), that the purpose of the requirement to seek permission “was to prevent the liquidator’s or administrator’s task being made more difficult by a scramble among creditors to raise actions, obtain decrees or attach assets”. A few years later, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Caltong</span><span class="font-italic"> (Australia) Pty Ltd (formerly known as Tong Tien See Holding (Australia) Pty Ltd) and another v Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another appeal</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 94 similarly stated as follows (at [51]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This court had in <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Bank v Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Keh Lam </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 219 stated that the purpose of s 76(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) was to prevent the [liquidators’] or administrator’s task from being made more difficult due to a scramble among creditors in taking action or obtaining decrees against the debtor or his assets. The requirement to obtain leave is to ensure that the court could guard against any inequity on account of such a scramble. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Finally, the District Court in <span class="font-italic">JA v JB</span> [2005] SGDC 104 (“<span class="font-italic">JA v JB</span>”), albeit in the family law context, also had occasion to observe (at [13]) that s 76(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 1996 Rev Ed) “serves the purposes of the bankruptcy regime by preventing a multiplicity of actions erupting or bubbling [as a result of actions] which have been or would be filed by creditors in the (mistaken) belief that doing so will give them greater priority amongst all the unsecured creditors when the bankrupt’s assets are distributed by the Official Assignee”. The learned District Judge went further to observe (at [13]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Such a multiplicity of actions would waste the resources of the bankrupt’s estate, distract the Official Assignee from his real task of gathering in and managing the bankrupt’s assets, and, ultimately, delay the distribution of the bankrupt’s assets to the creditors. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 However, apart from these general statements on the policy behind s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) and its predecessor provision, there does not appear to have been any other local decision explaining the relevant factors a court should consider when deciding whether to grant permission for legal proceedings to proceed against a bankrupt (see, for example, the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Liu </span><span class="font-italic">Yanzhe and another v Tan Eu Jin and others</span> [2019] SGHC 67 at [22]). That said, it is clearly important to bear these general statements in mind when considering the relevant factors to guide the exercise of discretion to grant permission under s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 More importantly, in my respectful view, the lack of a local decision explaining the relevant factors cannot mean that the discretion under s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) should be exercised absolutely with no rational basis. I agreed with V K Rajah JC (as the learned judge then was), who had said in the seminal High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 671 (“<span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span>”) that the discretion (in relation to the grant of permission to continue or commence proceedings against companies being wound up) “has to be exercised rationally in the context of the insolvency scheme” (at [45]). However, as the learned judge noted, it is important in my view to recognise that none of any such identified factors should be viewed as being decisive alone, nor should the factors be construed as fetters on the discretion conferred by the statutory provision (see <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management </span>at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant foreign authorities </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Given that the principles in Singapore are not well discussed, I also found it helpful to refer to the foreign jurisprudence stemming from the United Kingdom (“UK”) and Australia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I begin with the UK position.

If successful, such an action is unlikely to prejudice the creditors of the respondent. The section is not designed to protect an insurer.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) A condition is often imposed that the plaintiff will not enforce any judgment against the respondent without the leave of the court.

In Australia, s 58(3)(b) of the Australian Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (the “Australian Bankruptcy Act”) provides that leave of court is required to commence any legal proceeding or take any fresh step in such a proceeding against a bankrupt:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 58</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Vesting of property upon bankruptcy – general rule</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Except as provided by this Act, after a debtor has become a bankrupt, it is not competent for a creditor:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  to enforce any remedy against the person or the property of the bankrupt in respect of a provable debt; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  except with the leave of the Court and on such terms as the Court thinks fit, to commence any legal proceeding in respect of a provable debt or take any fresh step in such a proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Supreme Court of South Australia said in <span class="font-italic">Gertig</span><span class="font-italic"> v Davies</span> (2003) 85 SASR 226 (at [15]) that s 58(3) of the Australian Bankruptcy Act protects a bankrupt and the property of the bankrupt against the enforcement of remedies and enables the court to control proceedings in respect of a provable debt in the light of the objectives of the Act. The policy purpose behind this provision is therefore similarly to relieve the trustee and the estate of the costs and time in defending legal proceedings, and where the creditor applies for leave to commence or continue with proceedings, the court is tasked to apply a screening process to balance the interests of the creditors and of the estate (see Michael Murray and Jason Harris, <span class="font-italic">Keay’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Insolvency: Personal and Corporate Law and Practice</span> (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2018) at p 171). In this way, the bankrupt is freed from any claims that might be made in respect of the period prior to bankruptcy and the trustee in bankruptcy can treat a claim against the estate like the claim of all other creditors, so that the assets of the estate are, in due course, divided pro rata among the creditors (see the Federal Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">7Steel Building Solutions Pty Ltd v Wright</span> [2011] FCA 328 (“<span class="font-italic">7Steel Building Solutions</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10], citing <span class="font-italic">Re Rose; Ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Devaban Pty Ltd</span> (Unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Hill J, 7 October 1994) (“<span class="font-italic">Re Rose</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 There are a handful of cases in Australia which set out the relevant principles in a rather decentralised manner on how the court should exercise its discretion to grant leave, and the principles may be summarised as such:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, relevant to the exercise of the discretion conferred is whether the proposed claims are complex (both factually and legally) and whether it may be preferable for those issues to be resolved at a hearing rather than by way of a proof of debt (see <span class="font-italic">7Steel Building Solutions</span> at [12] and [20] citing the Federal Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd</span> (1977) 30 FLR 108 at 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Allanson v Midland Credit</span>”); see also, the Federal Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">Stojanovski</span><span class="font-italic"> v Stojanovski</span> [2018] FCA 580 at [9]). For example, this would be so where the facts are complex as the claim was also made against other defendants, apart from the bankrupt, who could be jointly and severally liable, and where some defences would form the basis of a cross-claim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, leave is more appropriately granted where the proceedings proposed against the bankrupt would require the involvement of “other parties” and for the proper conduct of which it may be necessary for the bankrupt to become a party (see <span class="font-italic">7Steel Building Solutions</span> at [10]–[11], citing the Federal Court of Australia decisions in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Rose</span>;<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Re Sharp; Ex parte Tietyens Investments Pty Ltd</span> [1998] FCA 1367; <span class="font-italic">Sturdy Components Pty Ltd v Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Sturt</span> [2000] FCA 884 at [3]; and <span class="font-italic">Done v Financial Wisdom Ltd</span> [2008] FCA 1706 at [34]–[35]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court will consider whether the applicant was seeking to gain some advantage over the other creditors by commencing proceedings at a certain time, and whether the trustee in bankruptcy opposes to leave being granted (see <span class="font-italic">7Steel Building Solutions</span> at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, it is relevant to assess if leave is granted, whether the bankrupt’s estate will suffer financially in any way (see the Federal Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">Macquarie Bank Limited v </span><span class="font-italic">Bardetta</span> [2005] FCA 507 at [19], citing <span class="font-italic">Allanson v Midland Credit</span> at 114).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the presence of any delay in the applicant seeking leave is relevant, though the court will also consider what the prejudice caused to any party by reason of the delay is. If any disadvantage to the bankrupt’s estate arises, leave should not be granted (see the Federal Court of Australia decision in <span class="font-italic">Armstrong Scalisi Holdings Pty Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Gioiello</span> [2018] FCA 1729 at [25], citing <span class="font-italic">Kattirtzis</span><span class="font-italic"> v Zaravinos</span> [2001] FCA 1158 at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For completeness, whilst situated in a different context of seeking leave to bring proceedings in the corporate insolvency context, I also found the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Cassegrain v Gerard Cassegrain</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co Pty Ltd (in liq)</span> [2012] NSWCA 435 (“<span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span>”) to be of assistance. Therein, it was stated that the relevant factors to be considered also include (at [33]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the amount and seriousness of the claims; the degree and complexity of the legal and factual issues involved; the stage to which the proceedings, if commenced, have progressed; the risk that the same issues would be relitigated if the claims were to be the subject of a proof of debt; whether the claim has arguable merit; whether proceedings are already in motion at the time of liquidation; whether the proceedings will result in prejudice to creditors; whether the claim is in the nature of a test case for the interest of a large class of potential claimants; whether the grant of leave will unleash an “avalanche of litigation”; whether the cost of the hearing will be disproportionate to the company’s resources; delay and whether pre-trial procedures such as discovery and interrogatories are likely to be required or beneficial …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having briefly surveyed the foreign authorities, it is now an appropriate juncture to consider the relevant factors to be applied in Singapore when determining whether permission should be granted to commence or continue proceedings against individuals who have been declared bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant factors to guide exercise of discretion to grant permission under s 327(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ii)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In considering the relevant factors, apart from the foreign cases, I found it helpful to refer to cases that have laid down factors in a similar context of granting permission to continue or commence proceedings against companies that are being wound up. The relevant statutory provisions are to be found in the following sections of the IRDA: s 133(1) (in relation to compulsory winding up) and s 170(2) (in relation to a creditor’s voluntary winding up). These provisions provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Effect of winding up order</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">133.</span>—(1)  When a winding up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed, no action or proceeding may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) by the permission of the Court; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in accordance with such terms as the Court may impose.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Property and proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">170.</span>—(2) After the commencement of the winding up, no action or proceeding may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by the permission of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my view, the policy that underlies s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii), which involves an insolvent individual, is the same as the policy which applies to the situation involving the grant of permission to continue or commence proceedings against an insolvent company. Indeed, as the learned District Judge put it in <span class="font-italic">JA v JB </span>(at [13]), “the same principles ought to apply to both categories of insolvent beings, as the task of the liquidator or the trustee in bankruptcy is the same – to gather in the assets of the insolvent person and then distribute them fairly … amongst the creditors in as efficient, expeditious and cost-effective a manner as possible after payment of secured and preferential debts”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Similarly, Rajah JC in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span> referred to the mandatory requirement for permission to proceed with or commence proceedings in the insolvency and judicial management regimes (at [32]–[37]). He noted (at [35]) that “the bankruptcy regime also creates similar fetters restraining any steps from being taken in any action or proceedings once bankruptcy has commenced” which was an integral feature of the insolvency scheme, thereby recognising that the policy across both situations of insolvency and bankruptcy is the same. Specifically, Rajah JC had said this as to the purpose for these provisions requiring permission before the continuation or commencement of proceedings against companies that are being wound up (at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rationale for these provisions is axiomatic: it is to prevent the company from being further burdened by expenses incurred in defending unnecessary litigation. The main focus of a company and its liquidators once winding up has commenced should be to prevent the fragmentation of its assets and to ensure that the interests of its creditors are protected to the fullest extent. In other words, returns to legitimate creditors should be maximised; the process of collecting assets and returning them to legitimate creditors should be attended to with all practicable speed. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This statement of principle was recently endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">An </span><span class="font-italic">Guang Shipping Pte Ltd (judicial managers appointed) and others v Ocean Tankers (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2022] 1 SLR 1232 at [10], noting that it was “well explained”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Accordingly, I adopted as my starting point the factors Rajah JC identified in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management </span>in relation to the continuation or commencement of proceedings against companies that are being wound up, which I regarded as being equally applicable to the situation under s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii). In this regard, the learned judge had identified the following factors: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the timing as to when the application for permission was made (at [47]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the nature of the claim, specifically, whether the claimant is attempting to obtain a benefit not otherwise available to it through the conventional winding up procedure, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by filing proof of debts (at [48]–[49]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the existing remedies, specifically, whether the claim can be dealt with within the insolvency regime (at [50]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) matrix factors including: (i) the views of the majority creditors, (ii) the need for an independent inquiry, and (iii) the choice of liquidator (at [51]–[57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, and having considered the factors identified by Rajah JC in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span>, the foreign jurisprudence,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and also by the plaintiff in the present application, I found the following to be relevant factors that a court should consider in the exercise of its discretion whether to grant permission for the continuation or commencement of proceedings against a bankrupt under s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the timing of the application for permission.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the nature of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the existing remedies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the merits of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the existence of prejudice to the creditors or to the orderly administration of the bankruptcy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) other miscellaneous factors such as the potential of an avalanche of litigation being unleashed by the grant of permission, the proportionality of the cost of the proceeding to the bankrupt’s resources, and the views of the majority creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I now elaborate on each of these factors briefly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Timing of the application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As Rajah JC held in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [47]), and as the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic"> Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Tycoon Construction Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(in liquidation)</span> [2016] SGHC 80 (“<span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic"> Y Steel Construction</span>”) (at [14(a)]), the timing as to when the application for permission was made could be a relevant consideration. An early application may persuade the court to allow the trustee in bankruptcy an opportunity to consider the matter in appropriate cases. The stage to which proceedings have progressed, as well as any delay in bringing the application for permission and whether pre-trial procedures are likely to be required or beneficial, are relevant factors (see above at [26]). Indeed, the closer to the date of bankruptcy the application is made, the more likely it is for a court to infer that the application was made to snatch at the bankrupt’s assets. Also, an application made when, for instance, the trustee in bankruptcy has completed much of his work, is not likely to be successful. However, it must be kept in mind that an early application does not, by itself, assure the grant of permission. The entire factual matrix must be considered by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Contrariwise, mere delay by itself would not necessarily prevent leave from being granted as leave is not to be withheld as a punishment (see above at [19(f)]). The court will consider what is the prejudice caused to any party by reason of the delay (see above at [25(e)]). The prejudice occasioned may depend on whether the memories of the parties and other witnesses have been impaired, and whether it is necessary to rely on those memories (see above at [20(e)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The nature of the claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The nature of the claim is also important. The claim must be of a type which should proceed by action rather than through the proofing procedure in bankruptcy (see above at [19(c)] and [20(c)]). The court will consider the degree of complexity of the legal and factual issues involved, and whether it may be preferable for those issues to be resolved at a hearing rather than by way of a proof of debt (see above at [25(a)]). Leave is also more appropriately granted where the proceedings proposed are proceedings to which other parties are involved, and for the proper conduct of which, it may be necessary for the bankrupt to become a party (see above at [25(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I would also add that the claims of secured creditors stand apart from unsecured creditors as made clear by s 327(3) of the IRDA. This provision provides that s 327 of the IRDA “does not affect the right of any secured creditor to realise or otherwise deal with the secured creditor’s security in the same manner as the secured creditor would have been entitled to realise or deal with it if this section had not been enacted” (subject to fulfilling the requirements in s 327(4) of the IRDA). This is similar to the insolvency regime, where secured creditors who are merely attempting to claim property which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> belonged to them should be “readily given” permission to proceed with or commence proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span> at [49]), because their security is regarded as standing apart from the pool of assets available for <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu</span> distribution amongst unsecured creditors (see the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">SCK </span><span class="font-italic">Serijadi Sdn Bhd v Artison Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2019] 1 SLR 680 at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The existing remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In a related vein, if the nature of the claim is such that it <span class="font-italic">can </span>be dealt with adequately within the bankruptcy regime, then a court will not likely grant permission for proceedings to continue or commence against the bankrupt. The court will also examine whether the company’s assets will be dissipated by attending to the claim and the reasons for wanting to proceed outside the insolvency scheme (see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction</span> at [14(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The rationale for this is simple. The entire purpose of the bankruptcy regime is to ensure an efficient method for creditors to be paid. If that regime can satisfactorily address a claim, then it would not serve any good purpose to grant permission to continue or commence proceedings by other means. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The merits of the claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As Rajah JC put it in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management </span>(at [48]), a court will be “loathe to lend its imprimatur to sterile litigation” and permission ought not to be given where “there is no likelihood of the claim being satisfied in any way”. While a court should not engage substantively with the merits of the proposed action at the grant of permission stage, it should not turn a blind eye to this as well. Again, the reason for this is in line with the purpose behind s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii). If the proposed action is doomed to fail from the start, then it would not serve any good purpose to grant permission to commence what would likely be an exercise in futility. It would be better to preserve the resources of the bankrupt for distribution, rather than expending a part of those on defending sterile litigation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The appropriate standard at which to assess the merits of the proposed action is “a serious question to be tried” similar to that required for interlocutory, relief rather than a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case (see above at [19(a)], and the examples in [20(a)] and [20(b)]). As noted in the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Bristol</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; West Building</span>, the court need not undertake a substantive investigation into the merits of the proposed claim, “provided that if on the face of the matter there was no arguable claim then clearly leave should be refused” on the grounds that it would be a waste of time and expense (at 489). In other words, the court must be satisfied that the proposed claim is not clearly unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The existence of prejudice and commercial morality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 If the nature of the claim is such that if prosecuted successfully, it would prejudice the claims of the other legitimate creditors in contravention of the statutorily prescribed <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>treatment for all unsecured creditors, the court should not grant permission to proceed with or commence proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span> at [48]). Further, it is for the applicant to demonstrate that there will be little or no prejudice occasioned to the creditors, the bankrupt’s estate or to the orderly administration of the bankruptcy if the action is to proceed (see above at [19(b)] and [25(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As Rajah JC held in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span> at [48], albeit not in an identical context, the court will examine every application to ensure that a party is not seeking to avail itself of a benefit that would not otherwise be available through the conventional winding up procedure (or in this case, the bankruptcy regime). This should be applicable to the situation under s 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) as well. For clarity, this “benefit that would not otherwise be available” refers to unfair commercial advantages such as jumping the ranking of the priority of creditors, but does not refer to having the dispute appropriately resolved by court proceedings when necessary (as opposed to the bankruptcy process). The court will thus consider whether the applicant was seeking to gain some advantage or steal a march over the other creditors, and in this connection, whether the trustee in bankruptcy opposes the grant of leave will be a relevant consideration (see above at [22] and [25(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Ultimately, the court is attempting to balance the collective interests of the general body of creditors against the relative hardship and injustice which may be experienced by the applicant. Thus, while convenience and the saving of costs are factors that would be taken into consideration, equally or if not more so, <span class="font-italic">fair play and commercial morality</span> are also important considerations (see <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management </span>at [42]; <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction</span> at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other miscellaneous factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Finally, there are the miscellaneous factors such as the potential of an avalanche of litigation being unleashed by the grant of permission, the proportionality of the cost of the proceeding to the bankrupt’s resources, and the views of the majority creditors, <span class="font-italic">etc</span> (see above at [26] and [31(d)]). At the end of the day, the court must exercise its discretion in a practical manner.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application to the present application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With the applicable law in mind, I turned to the present application. I granted permission for the plaintiff to continue Suit 1175 against the second defendant. I did so for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 First, considering the timing of the proposed action, Suit 1175 was commenced on 13 November 2019, which was more than two years before the second defendant took out the bankruptcy application (B 1122) on 6 May 2022, and the suit was already proceeding towards trial. The stage to which proceedings have progressed was advanced. As such, Suit 1175 was not filed in a scramble to reach the second defendant’s assets and obtain an unfair advantage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, considering the nature of the claim, Suit 1175 would not offend the <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>principle of distribution in bankruptcy or prevent the trustee in bankruptcy from effectively adhering to this principle because the second defendant has stated in the Statement of Affairs filed for his bankruptcy application that he had no preferential or secured creditors. I also noted that the trustee in bankruptcy has yet to object to the present application, having taken no position on the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Third, still considering the nature of the claim, the second defendant is a necessary party to Suit 1175 because the key factual issue in dispute is whether the second defendant had made the alleged representations to the applicant and whether he did so on behalf of the first defendant, given that the underlying action is founded in misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Fourth, considering the existence of remedies within the bankruptcy regime, the issues in dispute between the parties are more properly determined by a court of law instead of the trustee in bankruptcy. This is because while the plaintiff could very well file a proof of debt, the outcome of Suit 1175 would turn on key factual issues such as the veracity of the plaintiff’s account of the various representations allegedly made by the second defendant. As such, these are issues that would be better dealt with by a court of law, with the benefit of cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Fifth, as to the merits of the claim, I was satisfied that Suit 1175 raised serious questions to be tried. I did not think that it could be described in any way as being doomed to fail from the start.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Finally, I did not think that any of the miscellaneous factors militated against the grant of permission in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Thus, for all these reasons, I granted permission to the plaintiff to continue Suit 1175 against the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In the premises, I granted order in terms for prayers 1 and 2 in respect of High Court Summons No 2752 of 2022 (in Suit 1175).</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Aw Wen Ni and Poon Chun Wai (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first defendant and second defendant absent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
