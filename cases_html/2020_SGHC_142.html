Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) (“IHC”), to enter into a credit facility (to be referred to as the “Standby Facility”), and to use the funds to indirectly acquire its own shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiffs rely on three causes of action. First, the plaintiffs claim that as officers of IHC, the sixth defendant, Mr Fan Kow Hin (“Mr Fan”) and the eighth defendant, Ms Lim Beng Choo (“Ms Lim”), acted in breach of their duties to IHC. Second, the plaintiffs claim that the first to fifth defendants (the funding entities which are collectively referred to as the “Crest entities”), the seventh defendant, Mr Andrew Ah Kong Aathar (a substantial shareholder of IHC whom I shall refer to as “Mr Aathar”) and Ms Lim provided dishonest assistance to Mr Fan. Third, the plaintiffs claim that all the defendants engaged in a conspiracy by unlawful means to injure IHC. As a result of the defendants’ conduct, the plaintiffs suffered losses in connection with the Standby Facility, as well as another credit facility known as the “Geelong Facility”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Crest entities and Mr Lim defend the claims on various grounds. They also brought counterclaims against the plaintiffs. Although Mr Fan is a bankrupt, the plaintiffs obtained leave to continue with the action against him. Mr Fan, however, did not file a defence. He is not represented in the proceedings. Mr Aathar filed a bare defence. However, by the time of the trial, there was a stay of the proceedings against him. This was pursuant to a voluntary arrangement approved by Mr Aathar’s creditors under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed). Nonetheless, Mr Aathar, as well as Mr Fan, gave evidence before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The trial concerns both liability and quantum, save that there is bifurcation in relation to the quantification of one category of loss, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e, </span>loss arising from the termination and sale of the plaintiffs’ Australian business.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I pause to highlight that after the trial, but before the parties filed their closing and reply submissions, the Court of Appeal released <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) </span>[2019] 2 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III</span>”), and determined that the Standby Facility which funded the indirect acquisition by IHC of its own shares is void under by s 76A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) for contravention of s 76(1A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the same. This determination, as well as some of the observations within the Court of Appeal’s judgment, are pertinent to this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Having heard the evidence, and considered the closing and reply submissions of the parties, this is my judgment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 IHC is a Singapore-incorporated company listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”).

Mr Aathar said that the second 4 April 2015 related to the Standby Facility which was proposed by Mr Tan, after the Crest entities refused to invest directly in IHC shares: see [23]–[24] above.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 While Ms Lim did not throw light on the 3 April 2015 meeting or the two 4 April 2015 emails, she agrees with Mr Fan and Mr Aathar that the Standby Facility had nothing to do with the acquisition of IHC shares, and was one for “general working capital” only: see [25] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having reviewed the evidence, I accept Mr Tan’s version of events, and reject that given by Mr Aathar and Mr Fan for these reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Tan’s version is consistent with the contents of the first 4 April 2015 email which I reproduced at [19] above. Throughout the email, Mr Aathar used “we” instead of “I”. Specifically, he wrote that “[w]e look to Crest to provide a standby line of $20m for use against this activity.” As one of the terms of the standby line, he added that “[s]hares can be bought and held by Crest directly.” Three points are evident: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) First, Mr Aathar did not make the request in his personal capacity. His explanation that “we” referred to Mr Tan and himself makes no sense. It was clearly a request by Mr Fan and him, on behalf of IHC. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Second, the request was to avail IHC of funds by way of a standby line to combat the short-selling activity. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Third, there was no mention of the Crest entities investing in the shares. The Crest entities were being asked to buy and hold the shares pursuant to the standby line.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Tan’s evidence is also consistent with the contents of the second 4 April 2015 email. Given the proximity in time of the two emails, it seems to me they concerned the same deal. Indeed, they both carried the same subject title of “Standby Facility”. In it, Mr Aathar gave a firm undertaking on behalf of IHC in respect of the security arrangements for the facility, once again reinforcing the position that at all times, the request was for IHC. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Subsequently, the term sheet and the Standby Facility captured the key terms within the first 4 April 2015 email, and required the security arrangements set out in the second 4 April 2015 email. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Moreover, as I shall discuss later, in accordance with the first 4 April 2015 email, the Crest entities proceeded to purchase IHC shares and hold them as security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In contrast, the version proffered by Mr Fan and Mr Aathar would require a strained reading of the emails, and is inconsistent with the surrounding facts and circumstances. Therefore, I find that the Standby Facility originated from the 3 April 2015 meeting and the two 4 April 2015 emails. Its purpose was to avail IHC of funds for the acquisition of IHC shares. The Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar well knew of this purpose for the standby line – which was eventually formalised as the Standby Facility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 While I thus reject Ms Lim’s position that the Standby Facility was merely one for “general working capital”, her knowledge of the state of affairs remains to be considered. In due course, at [197] below, I shall also consider the Crest entities’ arguments that, in any event, they did not <span class="font-italic">intend</span> the acquisition of the shares to be the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> purpose for the Standby Facility,

In this connection, I do not find the cases cited by the plaintiffs in the closing submissions to be of assistance, as they involve the imposition of such duties on directors and/or shadow directors of companies (and not on other officers/employees of the companies): see <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) </span>[2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, </span><span class="font-italic">intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR (R) 109; <span class="font-italic">Lim Weng Kee v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 2 SLR (R) 848.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The starting point is that an employee may owe fiduciary duties to his employer in certain circumstances. For this principle, I turn to <span class="font-italic">Nottingham University v Fishel and another </span>[2000] IRLR 471 (“<span class="font-italic">Nottingham University</span>”) where Elias J said at [97]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [in] determining whether a fiduciary relationship arises in the context of an employment relationship, it is necessary to identify with care the particular duties undertaken by the employee, and to ask whether in all the circumstances he has placed himself in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer. It is only once those duties have been identified that it is possible to determine whether any fiduciary duty has been breached …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Thus, whether a fiduciary relationship arises in the context of an employment relationship is heavily fact-dependent: <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing and others </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance</span>”) at [25]. In <span class="font-italic">Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai </span>[2015] 1 SLR 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>”), a case cited by Ms Lim, Lee Seiu Kin J set out a framework for applying the <span class="font-italic">Nottingham University </span>test as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court will only regard an employee as a fiduciary if he is placed in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer. A mere employment relationship does not support the existence of a fiduciary relationship. It must be shown that there are particular functions of the employee, which requires him to pursue the interests of his employer to the exclusion of other interests, including his own (at [272]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The conditions for the imposition of fiduciary obligations on an employee are (at [275]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The employee has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The employee can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the company’s legal or practical interests.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The company is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the employee holding the discretion or power.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An employee will not owe fiduciary duties in respect of all aspects of his employment. There is no wholesale importation of every kind of fiduciary duty into each case. The fiduciary duties that arise are context-dependent and must be accommodated within the terms of the employment contract without altering its intended operation. The real question is whether the employee owed specific fiduciary duties in the particular circumstances in which it is alleged that he had acted against the interests of the employer (at [278]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 It is a question of fact whether senior employees will owe the same fiduciary duties as that of directors. Applying the test in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a senior employee who owes such fiduciary duties would need to be vested with broad discretionary<span class="font-italic"> </span>powers of management over the company. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O’Malley </span>(1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (“<span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero</span>”), the defendants, a president and executive vice-president of a company, were held to owe fiduciary duties similar to directors because they were “top management” employees: at 381.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">ABB Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Sher Hock Guan Charles </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 111 (“<span class="font-italic">ABB</span>”), the High Court held that the defendant owed fiduciary duties akin to those owed by directors to the third plaintiff which he had breached by failing to inform the third plaintiff of the competitive intentions of potential competitors. This was because the defendant was in charge of all aspects of the third plaintiff’s business, being responsible for its general management as well as business development, marketing and sales. He was also in a position to hire and fire employees, and attended meetings of the Country Management Team where the plaintiffs’ various businesses were discussed. As such, at [42], he was found to have been “a very senior employee indeed” and therefore owed fiduciary duties which “have been formulated in various authorities as the duties owed by a director to his company and there is no reason to formulate the fiduciary duties of a senior employee any differently.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Fiduciary duties will not be imposed on an employee who is subject to a high degree of supervision and review by a more senior employee. That was the case in <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>”) where two employees, even though they had some authority to negotiate contracts on the company’s behalf or authorize the payment of invoices, were not held to be fiduciaries because they were members of the company’s middle management and had to obtain their superiors’ sanction for their decisions (at [29]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Griffin Travel Pte Ltd v Nagender Rao Chilkuri and others </span>[2014] SGHC 205 (“<span class="font-italic">Griffin Travel</span>”), the employees in question were heads of their respective departments (one of them being the company’s Chief Financial Officer). Nevertheless, they were not held to be fiduciaries because they had to report to two more senior employees and obtain their sanction for many of their decisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 It is clear from the authorities that fiduciary duties will likely only be imposed on an employee who is, effectively, the “ruler in his own domain”, subject to minimal levels of supervision and having a wide discretion over critical aspects of the company’s business. Fiduciary duties akin to those owed by a director would likely be imposed on senior employees whose domain extended to all or substantially all of the business of the company, as in <span class="font-italic">ABB </span>and <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Returning to the present case, I find that, Mr Fan, as Group CEO and subsequently CEO of IHC, was, from 17 May 2015, a member of IHC’s senior management.

Mr Fan was, alongside Mr Aathar, one of the two key persons involved in negotiating the terms of the Standby Facility with the Crest entities. Furthermore, I also found (at [95]) that Mr Fan knew about the drawdowns of the funds from 16 April 2015 to acquire IHC shares. I should add that in his evidence, Mr Fan admitted that he was aware of the prohibition against a company buying its own shares without a proper share buy-back mandate.

</div> In my view, there would be no reason for Mr Fan to omit all mention of the purchase of shares if, to his mind, that was perfectly legal or in IHC’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 This action was significant in causing IHC to enter into the Standby Facility. As I observed at [104], Mr Siew’s vote in favour of the Standby Facility, which broke the tie between the votes cast by Dr Jong and Mr Ong, was given on the basis that the Standby Facility was necessary for operational purposes. As such, it is questionable whether his approval would have been given had he been aware that the Standby Facility would be used to purchase IHC shares, with the result that IHC would likely not have entered into the Standby Facility in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 By entering into the Standby Facility, IHC then incurred substantial liabilities in the form of the standby fees and drawdowns used to purchase its own shares. The plaintiffs argue that, from IHC’s perspective, there really was no commercial purpose at all for IHC to enter into the Standby Facility.

His duty of fidelity required him to not act for his own benefit or the benefit of any third party without the informed consent of IHC. However, he failed to disclose to IHC’s board of directors that the funds had already been used from the Standby Facility to acquire IHC shares (which was the true purpose of the facility), and that this course of action may be of benefit to Mr Aathar and him. Along the same vein, he also put himself in a position of conflict, resulting in the breach of his duty to avoid conflicts of interest.

</div> In response, the plaintiffs argue that it is unbelievable that Ms Lim, as the person in charge of the legal documents, would not have familiarised herself with the underlying details of the proposed transaction by reading the email and the term sheet.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In my view, Mr Fan’s email of 9 April 2015 was meant to introduce Mr Chia and Ms Lim to Mr Tan, so as to kick-start the process to formalise the transaction. As CEO, I would have expected Mr Chia to be more concerned about the purpose of the proposed transaction. As for Ms Lim, it is not unbelievable that she did not pay attention to the email right at the bottom of the chain because it is not entirely surprising that her focus would have been on the legal documents – which arrived via a subsequent email sent by Mr Tan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 As for the term sheet, when she received it, Ms Lim noted that the purpose was for “general working capital”. Even if she were to read the security term about the pledge of the IHC shares, the significance might not have been entirely clear to her without the necessary background information. In this connection, it is undisputed that Ms Lim was not involved in the initial negotiations over the Standby Facility, and that Mr Fan did not brief her on the deal.

At trial, Ms Lim attempted to explain away this email by asserting that the drawdown referred to was the Crest entities’ own drawdown from their own investors, and not a drawdown made by IHC. In fact, Ms Lim gave the same explanation for the fourth piece of evidence, as to why she accepted that the legal documents could be backdated to 16 April 2015.

</div> This was not a credible explanation. This, taken together with the fifth and sixth pieces of evidence on how she reacted when the Crest entities demanded for payment, reinforces my view that she was aware of the drawdowns from 16 April 2015. However, the evidence does not go further to show that she knew or ought to have known that the funds had been used for the acquisition of shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 On the basis of the above, I find that Ms Lim breached her duty to IHC by failing to exercise due skill, care and diligence in the discharge of her duties. I accept that in her position, she remained answerable to Mr Chia, Mr Fan and Dr Jong, and had to take instructions from them. However, she should have made, but did not make, further enquiries as to the reasons for the drawdown on the Standby Facility, and to raise the matter to the board of directors before the signing of the legal documents had such reasons been unsatisfactory. As a result, IHC formally entered into the Standby Facility and incurred substantial liabilities to purchase its own shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Based on these findings, I do not think that Ms Lim breached the other duties. Without the requisite knowledge that the Standby Facility was for the illegal purpose of IHC acquiring its own shares, she would have thought that it was a facility for “general working capital”, and thus could have been used for that purpose. There are insufficient grounds to say that Ms Lim had not acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, that she had acted for improper purposes, or that she had taken into account the interests of the substantial shareholders to the detriment of IHC’s interests. Further, it was not seriously contended that Ms Lim stood to gain from the transaction.

At all times, the Crest entities understood the case against them to be based on Mr Tan’s acts in the transaction, as the authorised representative of each of the Crest entities. Indeed, the Crest entities rely on the acts of Mr Tan; they do not dispute that he had acted with authority.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 To elaborate, at paras 2.2.4, 2.25 and 2.2.17(e) of SOC4, the plaintiffs plead Mr Tan’s role and involvement in the Standby Facility, as “admitted to” by Mr Tan, the Investment Director of Crest Capital, in his affidavit filed in these proceedings on 10 May 2016 on behalf of the Crest entities. These material facts concerning Mr Tan thus form the basis of the plaintiffs’ allegations of dishonesty and/or injurious intent on the part of the Crest entities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In D6CC3, at para 5, the Crest entities plead that the Standby Facility investors (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>EFIII, VMF3 and VMIII) were “managed in all aspects” by Crest Capital and Crest Catalyst. At paras 15A, 15B and 16 of D6CC3, the Crest entities do not dispute the events involving Mr Tan. None of the Crest entities disassociated themselves from Mr Tan’s acts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Therefore, I do not think that the plaintiffs’ pleading is deficient.

Thus, I am of the view that all the acts (including those before 17 May 2015) had a causative effect on Mr Fan’s breach of fiduciary duties, and therefore assisted the same.

During that period, there were at least five statements of accounts and over 20 debit notes issued, but it was not until 5 February 2016 that the statements/debit notes reflected that the principal was drawn down under the Standby Facility.

</div> This flagrantly contravened the procedure set out in the Standby Facility agreement, and Mr Tan was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation why he permitted this course of action. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Even after the dispute arose in February 2016, the Crest entities did not provide IHC with information about the drawdowns. As stated at [43], IHC’s finance team had asked the Crest entities’ finance team for supporting documents for the drawdowns, contending that there had not been any drawdown. Instead of providing the details, the Crest entities responded by asking IHC to check with Mr Fan or Mr Aathar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Contrary to the position argued by the Crest entities, I do not consider actual knowledge of the statutory prohibition a requirement for proving dishonesty. However, as the point arises again in the context of the unlawful means conspiracy, I will address the factual dispute. Based on the various strands of evidence set out above, on a balance of probabilities, I find that at the very lowest, Mr Tan ought to have known of the prohibition under the Companies Act. There is no other conceivable reason for him to disregard the procedural safeguards in the Standby Facility agreement on disbursements, and for the conduct displayed by the Crest entities above. In fact, I am prepared to conclude that he had actual knowledge of this fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 That said, to reiterate, the test of dishonesty is an objective one – that a defendant knew at the material time the assistance is given of the “irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of the standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them”. Even leaving aside the question of the knowledge of the statutory provision, Mr Tan (and thus the Crest entities) well knew about the serious irregularities in the various drawdowns from the Standby Facility (especially prior to its formalisation). They did not query these irregularities but allowed the arrangement to continue and even formalised the Standby Facility with IHC. Their participation involved a breach of the standards of honest conduct.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 For completeness, I note that the plaintiffs plead that the Crest entities knew or ought to have known of Mr Fan’s breaches of fiduciary duties.

</div> The Crest entities deny this. While the parties’ closing and reply submissions do not address this issue substantively, I think it is necessary to discuss this, as it has some relevance in the claim for unlawful means conspiracy.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Turning to the law, it is not necessary for the Crest entities to know specifically that Mr Fan owed and breached fiduciary duties. In <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([153] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Lord Hoffmann observed that it was not necessary for it to be proved that the defendant had actual knowledge that monies disposed (in breach of trust) were actually held in trust, saying at [28]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, it was not necessary … that Mr Henwood should have concluded that the disposals were of moneys held in trust. It was sufficient that he should have entertained a clear suspicion that this was the case. Secondly, it is quite unreal to suppose that Mr Henwood needed to know all the details to which the court referred before he had grounds to suspect that Mr Clowes and Mr Cramer were misappropriating their investors’ money. … In <span class="font-italic">Brinks Ltd v Abu-Saleh </span>[1996] CLC 133, 151 Rimer J expressed the opinion that a person cannot be liable for dishonest assistance in a breach of trust unless he knows of the existence of the trust or at least the facts giving rise to the trust. <span class="font-italic">But their Lordships do not agree.

Again, I rely on the matters at [160]. I would also add a few more facts to the mix. First, Mr Tan knew that Mr Fan and Mr Aathar were substantial shareholders of IHC, and had their own interests to protect as shareholders which were separate and distinct from IHC’s interests. Second, there was a fairly long delay in the formal execution of the Standby Facility, from the time the draft documents were sent to IHC on 9 April 2015 to 21 July 2015 when the duly executed documents were returned by Mr CP Lim to IHC. I compare this with the Geelong Facility which was fully executed by 17 June 2015, but for which negotiations started later in time. Third, it took the changeover from Mr Chia as CEO to Mr Fan as Group CEO and then CEO before the process was completed. Despite all these circumstances, Mr Tan allowed the drawdowns and acquisitions of shares on the instructions of Mr Aathar, in non-compliance with the proper procedure provided in the Standby Facility agreement (and only furnished updates to Mr Aathar and Mr Fan). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Aathar acted dishonestly </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 As I found above at [93] and [95], Mr Aathar knew that the purpose of the Standby Facility was for IHC to incur liabilities to purchase its own shares, but still gave the instructions to the Crest entities to acquire the shares. At the trial, he admitted that he knew of the prohibition against a company buying its own shares without a proper share buyback mandate.

</div> With such knowledge while negotiating the deal, Mr Aathar facilitated IHC’s entry into the Standby Facility by giving a personal guarantee. He also executed the Standby Facility agreement (as a personal guarantor). I have no doubt he knew that Mr Fan (who had taken over as Group CEO and then CEO) dealt with the process in breach of his duties.

As I found at [135]–[136] above, her conduct was negligent. However, she was not necessarily also dishonest. For her to be dishonest, she must be shown to have suspected that something was wrong but chose not to want to know the truth: <span class="font-italic">MKC Associates </span>([153] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [272].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 On the facts, Ms Lim’s purported knowledge of any impropriety in the Standby Facility could only come from her knowing that the purpose of the Standby Facility was to purchase IHC shares, and that funds had been used to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 While I accept that Ms Lim acquired some knowledge that the Standby Facility had been drawn down for unknown purposes, this could well have included drawdowns for working capital. Relying on what I have previously found at [131]–[135] above, Ms Lim owed it to IHC to investigate further but did not. However, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude on a balance of probabilities that Ms Lim knew that the Standby Facility had been drawn down for the acquisition of IHC’s own shares. There is no doubt Ms Lim was negligent. I do not, however, consider her negligence to rise to the level of dishonesty.

</div> In relation to the factual dispute as to whether Mr Tan (and thus the Crest entities) knew of the legal prohibition against a company buying its own shares, I had already made certain findings: see [161] above. I proceed now to deal with the Crest entities’ contention that ignorance of the legal prohibition would absolve the Crest entities of liability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether knowledge of the illegal nature of the acts is required   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The starting point is <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco Ltd and others </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 513 (“<span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span>”), which endorsed the legal position in <span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd and others </span>[1979] 1 Ch 250 (“<span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance</span>”), and held that ignorance of the illegality of the act is not a defence to an unlawful conspiracy claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Knowledge of the alleged conspirators features, however, in relation to two elements of the tort. First, as stated in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([171] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">, </span>proof of a mere intention to injure suffices to succeed in a claim founded on unlawful means conspiracy, whereas for a lawful means conspiracy, a predominant intention to injure must be proved. If the defendants are to <span class="font-italic">intend </span>the damaging consequences of their actions, they must necessarily also actually<span class="font-italic"> know</span> that such an act carries the damaging consequences alleged: at [73], [99]–[101]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Second, the element of combination requires proof of two or more persons and an agreement between or among them to do certain acts: <span class="font-italic">Nagase </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 at [23]. Agreement is often inferred from the circumstances and acts of the alleged conspirators, provided that the alleged conspirators must have been “sufficiently aware of the surrounding circumstances and share the object for it properly to be said that they were acting in concert at the time of the acts complained of”: <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [113]. To reframe this, an agreement may be inferred from the parties’ knowledge of the facts on which the conspiracy is founded, even if they did not appreciate the legal effect of those facts: see Gary Chan Kok Yew, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2011) at [15.054].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The Crest entities are essentially arguing for proof of a further mental state – <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that of actual knowledge by the alleged conspirators of the unlawful nature of the means deployed – before a claimant can succeed in an unlawful means conspiracy claim. Thus, they contend that the Crest entities must be proven to have actual knowledge of the illegality of the Standby Facility.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> 1st to 5th Defendants’ Reply Submissions (“DRS”) at [99].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I have set this out at [175] above. I agree with the plaintiffs that <span class="font-italic">Hello! </span>analyses the various states of mind that could amount to an intention to injure, and decided that knowledge of the consequences is required. However, <span class="font-italic">Hello! </span>does not stand for the proposition that knowledge of the illegality of the act is required, or that ignorance of the illegality is a defence.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Turning to <span class="font-italic">Beckkett</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([177] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the case concerned both lawful and unlawful means conspiracy in a forced sale of shares. In relation to the intention to injure, at [121]–[122],  Kan Ting Chiu J (as he then was) held as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If Deutsche Bank and DSM did not knowingly fix the price at an undervalue, there can be no agreement to cause Beckkett injury by transacting at an undervalue. Taking the argument a step further, even if DSM had known that US$46m was an undervalue, that is not evidence of a predominant intention on its part to injure Beckkett because its primary interest was to purchase the shares at the lowest price, and not to injure Beckkett, and it cannot be said that the predominant intention of the combination was to cause injury. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Beckkett also relied on the agreement to seek court approval for the sale by the <span class="font-italic">penetapans</span> as evidence of the conspiracy to injure. <span class="font-italic">Prima facie, </span>the agreement to obtain the court approvals ex parte was to facilitate the transaction. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There was no evidence </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that Deutsche Bank or DSM knew at that time that penetapans were inappropriate and that putusans were required</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> There can be no inference that they <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">intended</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>to do something <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unlawful</span>. It would of course be different if they had agreed to do something they knew to be wrong, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to under-declare the sale price.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Read in context, again, it seems to me that <span class="font-italic">Bec</span><span class="font-italic">kkett</span> is concerned with actual knowledge that goes towards proving the combination/agreement, and/or towards proving the intention to injure. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Multi-</span><span class="font-italic">Pak</span> is not discussed in <span class="font-italic">Beck</span><span class="font-italic">kett</span>, and I do not agree that <span class="font-italic">Beckkett </span>marked a departure from the former.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Along the same vein, in <span class="font-italic">Meretz</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([177] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">,</span> Arden LJ held, in the context of the tort of inducing breach of contract, that a person does not have the <span class="font-italic">requisite intention to injure</span> another as a means to further his own interests if the causative act is something which that person believes he was entitled to do, because all that he intends is to produce a result which he believed he was entitled to produce: at [127]. Toulson LJ expressed the view (albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>) that this could be extended to the tort of unlawful means conspiracy, such that it was a defence if the defendant not only acted to protect his own interests but did so in the belief that he had a lawful right to act as he did: at [174]. Once again, the concern is with proof of the intention to injure.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Accordingly, I do not agree with the Crest entities that knowledge of illegality is a distinct requirement of unlawful means conspiracy, or that ignorance of illegality is a defence. However, knowledge of the facts and surrounding circumstances is relevant, insofar as knowledge goes to prove the combination/agreement of the alleged conspirators, and/or the intention to injure.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was an agreement to do certain acts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I have set out the law on the element of combination at [171] above. To summarise, there must be an agreement by the alleged conspirators to pursue a particular course of action. I should add that alleged conspirators need not have participated in the alleged conspiracy at the same time, nor do they need to know what they have each agreed to do. All that is necessary is for a plaintiff to establish that the conspirators are “sufficiently aware of the surrounding circumstances and share the same object”: <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([171] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [113].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 I am satisfied that the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar formed an agreement to cause IHC to enter into and draw down on the Standby Facility to purchase IHC shares. The backdrop of their agreement was a potential short-seller’s attack on IHC shares, and a desire on the part of Mr Aathar and Mr Fan to stabilise IHC’s share price. After the three of them discussed the matter on 3 April 2015, they followed up with a series of emails the next day regarding the precise terms of the Standby Facility. The parties envisaged that IHC would be able to avail itself of funds under the Standby Facility to purchase its own shares, and this was the common object.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Turning to Ms Lim, she entered the picture later. As I found above, she acted negligently in her role in the preparation and finalisation of the legal documents. However, there is insufficient evidence to find that she knew the true purpose of the Standby Facility, or that there had been drawdowns for the acquisition of IHC shares. Indeed, Mr Fan did not brief her on the deal. I am unable to infer from the surrounding circumstances that she acted in combination with the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement, and whether the acts were unlawful </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I also find that the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar furthered their common object through procuring IHC’s entry into and subsequent drawdowns on the Standby Facility. At the risk of repetition, Mr Aathar gave Mr Tan instructions to draw down on the Standby Facility, and to acquire IHC shares on IHC’s behalf. Mr Fan was instrumental in obtaining approval from the IHC board for the Standby Facility, namely by clearing and endorsing the board paper. Both Mr Fan and Mr Aathar personally guaranteed the Standby Facility, which further facilitated IHC’s entry into the Standby Facility. Without their involvement, IHC would not have entered into the Standby Facility, nor would it have used the facility to purchase its own shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The Standby Facility was illegal for contravention of the Companies Act, while Mr Fan breached his fiduciary duties by virtue of his role in the transaction. The Crest entities well knew of all the surrounding facts regarding IHC’s purchase of its own shares using the Standby Facility. Any claim of ignorance of the statutory provision is not a defence. Admittedly, Mr Tan might not have been fully aware of how Mr Fan acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to procure IHC’s formal execution of the Standby Facility. However, it is not a requirement to show that a conspirator knew exactly what each co-conspirator had agreed to do (or had then proceeded to do). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was any intention to injure </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 On the issue of the intention to injure on the part of the alleged conspirators, it is insufficient for IHC to simply show that harm to IHC would be a likely, probable or even inevitable consequence of the conduct. That the conspirators intended injury to IHC as a means to an end or an end in itself must be established. Additionally, if the conspirators are to <span class="font-italic">intend </span>the damaging consequences of their actions, they must necessarily also actually<span class="font-italic"> know</span> that such an act carries the damaging consequences alleged: <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>([171] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [99]–[101]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 IHC argues that the requisite intention to injure IHC on the part of the Crest entities, Mr Fan, Mr Aathar and Ms Lim was made out on the following bases:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The conspiracy to cause or procure IHC to enter into and draw down on the Standby Facility to purchase IHC shares was clearly targeted and directed at inflicting injury to IHC. As IHC was the contractual party to the Standby Facility, it was certain to be saddled with substantial liability for the principal drawn down, interest/standby fees (which IHC submits are exorbitant) and price fluctuations for the shares. IHC also stood to lose its Australian business if the liabilities were not discharged.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I am mindful that a predominant intention to injure is not required. It could well be that in granting the facility, the Crest entities had all the other commercial considerations in mind and were also motivated by the returns from the transaction. However, unlike other commercial deals, the Standby Facility was intended for IHC to acquire its own shares (which the Crest entities knew or ought to have known to be in contravention of the Companies Act). This was sufficient, in and of itself, to show an intention to injure on the part of the Crest entities. Put in another way, the intended injury is simply the imposition of the liability – including the standby fees – on IHC for the purchase of its own shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Linked to the above is the Crest entities’ argument that the acquisition of shares was not the sole purpose of the Standby Facility, and that the Standby Facility was broadly framed as a loan for “general working capital”. However, given that Mr Tan proceeded to take instructions from Mr Aathar and to acquire IHC shares, he well knew that the Standby Facility was for the <span class="font-italic">very</span> purpose of share acquisitions. Indeed, as highlighted by the plaintiffs, this was tantamount to arguing that the Standby Facility was a plain vanilla credit facility while the acquisition of shares was a separate agreement.

The Crest entities submit that the plaintiffs have ventured beyond their pleadings by relying on acts of the Crest entities in concealing and/or camouflaging the nature of the Standby Facility (especially as part of the unlawful means conspiracy claim).

</div> They argue that this is an impermissible expansion of their case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 In response, the plaintiffs contend that the unlawful acts relied on (and pleaded) were the entry into and drawdowns on the Standby Facility (which was in contravention of the Companies Act) and Mr Fan’s breach of duties. These have been pleaded. The omissions, concealment or acts of camouflaging were merely evidential matters surrounding the unlawful acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 I agree. For instance, as set out above at [160] above, the plaintiffs rely on what the Crest entities did not do, <span class="font-italic">eg, </span>the pledge of shares was not mentioned in the facility documents, the failure to provide updates of share purchases to IHC, <span class="font-italic">et</span><span class="font-italic"> cetera</span>, as evidence that the Crest entities knew of the contravention of the Standby Facility.

It is argued that this should attract a range of adverse inferences, especially the adverse inference that the IHC board knew of the purpose of the Standby Facility, and that there were drawdowns under it.

</div> His role in the Standby Facility was not substantial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Similarly, from the evidence before me, it appears that Dr Jong was not substantially involved in the events of concern, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the negotiations leading into the entry of the Standby Facility, the drawdowns and the subsequent negotiations for repayment involving Mr Fan, Mr Aathar and Mr Tan. Furthermore, the board paper did not mention the drawdowns to purchase the IHC shares. From the responses of the directors, Mr Ong and Mr Siew, the true purpose of the Standby Facility, and the drawdowns under it, were not formally disclosed to Mr Ong and Mr Siew. Therefore, I am not sure what material evidence Dr Jong would have given on this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 I do not think, therefore, that the failure to call either Dr Jong and/or Mr Chia warrants the drawing of adverse inferences against the plaintiffs.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Damages and/or equitable compensation for losses suffered  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for damages and/or equitable compensation for the alleged losses.

More importantly, the Court of Appeal settled the controversy on the applicable test of causation, and set out the approach in relation to the breach of core fiduciary duties as follows (at [254]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In a claim for a non-custodial breach of the duty of no-conflict or no-profit or the duty to act in good faith, the plaintiff-principal must establish that the fiduciary breached the duty and establish the loss sustained. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the plaintiff-principal is able to meet the requirements of (a), a rebuttable presumption that the fiduciary’s breach caused the loss arises. The legal burden is on the wrongdoing fiduciary to rebut the presumption, to prove that the principal would have suffered the loss in spite of the breach.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the fiduciary is able to show that the loss would be sustained in spite of the breach, no equitable compensation can be claimed in respect of that loss.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where the fiduciary is unable to show that the loss would be sustained in spite of the breach, the upper limit of equitable compensation is to be assessed by reference to the position the principal would have been in had there been no breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 As I found above, Mr Fan breached his core fiduciary duties to IHC, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, duty of fidelity<span class="font-italic"> </span>and duty to avoid conflict. Thus, the approach set out above is applicable in considering whether Mr Fan is liable for any of the alleged losses. I note, however, that the parties’ closing and reply submissions were filed before <span class="font-italic">Winsta. </span>Without the benefit of the extensive analysis in <span class="font-italic">Winsta, </span>the plaintiffs briefly submitted that they may claim equitable compensation to restore them to the position they would have been in <span class="font-italic">if not </span>for the breach, citing the line of cases of <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([108] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">, Then Khek Koon </span>([99] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Tongbao (Singapore) Shipping Pte Ltd and another </span><span class="font-italic">v Woon Swee Huat and others </span>[2018] SGHC 165 (“<span class="font-italic">Tongbao</span>”).

</div> The Crest entities also relied on the same line of cases, submitting (perhaps more completely than the plaintiffs) that the approach within such cases is that where a fiduciary had breached his duty of honesty and fidelity, a plaintiff should still prove that the breach was in some way connected to the loss, so as to shift the burden to the fiduciary to prove that the principal would have suffered the loss regardless of the fiduciary’s breach.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my analysis below, where necessary, I recast the parties’ arguments within the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 I should add that in relation to two areas of loss, I thought it necessary to consider whether the chain of causation had been broken by intervening events. Thus, I invited parties to submit specifically on the question whether other common law limiting doctrines, especially intervening causes, apply to equitable compensation. This question was left open in <span class="font-italic">Winsta </span>(at [216]). I shall deal with this point from [276] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 Unlike Mr Fan, I found that Ms Lim breached her duty of due skill, care and diligence. This is not a core fiduciary duty (see <span class="font-italic">Winsta </span>at [253]) and, accordingly, the presumption of causation does not apply. Instead, her liability for equitable compensation is subject to the common law doctrines of foreseeability, causation and remoteness: <span class="font-italic">Mothew </span>([99] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon </span>at [108]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Liability for dishonest assistance is secondary in nature. Thus, a party who is a dishonest accessory to another’s breach of fiduciary duty is made jointly and severally liable for equitable compensation to the plaintiff for the losses suffered in respect of that breach. Thus, there is no need for causation to be established between the assistance rendered and the loss suffered: <span class="font-italic">Tongbao </span>at [131]. It follows that the Crest entities and Mr Aathar, as dishonest accessories, are jointly and severally liable with Mr Fan for any losses that would not have been suffered by IHC but for Mr Fan’s breaches of fiduciary duties. Given this position, it is unsurprising that the Crest entities made substantive arguments in relation to the losses Mr Fan should be liable for (which I duly consider below).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 In the case of unlawful means conspiracy, joint and several <span class="font-italic">primary</span> liability attaches to the tortfeasors in respect of loss that would not have been sustained “but for” their commission of the tort: <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span><span class="font-italic"> Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 655<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [387]–[388]. This applies to the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar. Such damages in tort are generally intended to place the plaintiff in the same position as he would have been in had the tort not been committed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Adopting the approaches and tests above, I will assess the defendants’ liability for the losses claimed by the plaintiffs.

While IHC Medical Re was the contracting party for the Geelong Facility, the liabilities it incurred thereunder were eventually satisfied out of the security furnished by IHC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Charged Shares by way of the 17 June Deed of Charge).

This WhatsApp message is set out at [127(e)] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 On point (d), I observe that the WhatsApp message referred to does not show that IHC clearly intended to use the sum to repay the Standby Facility. This message shows that Ms Lim was raising the concern that there was no record in IHC’s books of any drawdown on the Standby Facility justifying payment. This is consistent with the fact that the IHC finance team was querying the drawdowns on the Standby Facility alleged by the Crest entities at the time. I shall deal with points (a) to (c) in relation to the next area of loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 For now, it suffices for me to say that the Crest entities’ arguments miss the point for this category of losses. To rebut the presumption of causation, the issue is whether in any event, the funds would <span class="font-italic">not </span>have been applied towards the Geelong Facility. Having found that the S$4,538,800 represented otherwise available funds that could have been applied towards the Geelong Facility, the question is whether IHC would or would not have applied such funds to the Geelong Facility. Whether they would or would not have paid off the Geelong Facility in full, or whether they intended the S$3,883,950 for the Standby Facility, are irrelevant considerations. I do not see any reason why, if the Standby Facility had not been entered into in the first place, IHC would not have used these funds to partially satisfy the Geelong Facility. The S$3,500,000 payment it made towards the Geelong Facility on 4 December 2015 demonstrates this.

This depends, in turn, on two factors: its willingness and ability to repay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 I deal first with IHC’s willingness to repay the sum. In my view, the repayments of S$3,500,000 and S$3,883,950 clearly demonstrats such willingness on the part of IHC. I accept IHC’s position that the confusion over the application of the S$3,883,950 towards the Standby Facility, which was caused by Mr Fan’s breach, was the principal reason why further payments were not made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The WhatsApp message sent by Ms Lim to Mr Fan raised a query about the Crest entities’ application of the sum of S$3,883,950 towards the Standby Facility, and showed clearly that some confusion had been caused. Although Ms Lim should have been aware of the possibility of a drawdown or drawdowns, she remained unclear about what exactly happened. Such confusion would not have arisen if the Standby Facility had not even been entered into in the first place. It is also significant, in my opinion, that further payments to the Crest entities ceased after the dispute over the existence of drawdowns on the Standby Facility had arisen. Prior to this, IHC had made three payments to the Crest entities for the standby fees under the Standby Facility and the S$3,500,000 payment for the Geelong Facility. This lends credence to IHC’s evidence that it was the dispute over the Standby Facility, which would not have occurred but for Mr Fan’s breach, that caused it to withhold further payment under the Geelong Facility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 In relation to IHC’s ability to repay the outstanding Geelong Facility liability of S$4,196,525, IHC asserts that it had available funds to repay the Geelong Facility in full upon maturity, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 28 February 2016.

</div> The Australian Receivers were appointed pursuant to these notices of default and they proceeded to sell the Australian properties for a total of A$135.25m. While the combined sale price was higher than the combined valuation of A$114.5m as at 31 December 2015, significant costs and expenses were incurred in the course of the receivership. Also, the Geelong property was sold at A$10m less than the valuation of A$27.5m.

Mr Fan’s breach of fiduciary duties led to the entry into and drawdown on the Standby Facility, which led to the default on the Geelong Facility, and which then led to the disputes over the Standby Facility and the Geelong Facility. If not for Mr Fan’s breach, the plaintiffs would not incur the losses. To put it another way, it does not seem to me that such losses would have been sustained by IHC even if Mr Fan had not breached his fiduciary duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 However, I am troubled by the circumstances under which Suit 856 was brought and the 20 October 2016 Court Order was made (which I shall reiterate below at [293]). Further, two other points made by the plaintiffs were of concern. First, in relation to the costs for the banker’s guarantee, the plaintiffs submit that after I had declared the Standby Facility void at first instance in OS380, on 1 August 2018, IHC had written to the Crest entities to request the release of about S$9m from the surplus sale proceeds to IHC. This was because the plaintiffs took the view that since the Standby Facility had been declared void, there was no necessity for any sums to be held on escrow under the 20 October Court Order to meet any purported liabilities under the Standby Facility.

In doing so, I was mindful that Mr Fan was not represented, and did not file a defence. Indeed, this matter was not raised by any party. However, it seemed to me that the conduct of IHC and the Crest entities (the evidence of which was clearly placed before me by the plaintiffs) should not be ignored in considering at whose feet liability for such losses should lie. Therefore, I sought the further views of the parties whether Mr Fan should be liable for these losses. Apart from the plaintiffs and the Crest entities, the trustees of the estate of Mr Fan (represented by PK Wong &amp; Nair LLC for this purpose) provided further submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicability of intervening causes to equitable compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 In <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([213] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal observed that whether other common law limiting doctrines apart from causation, such as remoteness, foreseeability, intervening causes, contributory responsibility and mitigation ought to apply to a claim for equitable compensation had not been argued by the parties in that case (at [127]). The Court of Appeal did not determine the issue but observed that there is conflicting case law on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 Indeed, on the one hand, there is a strand of authority that advocates a strict approach to liability for equitable compensation. Under this strict approach, common law limiting factors will not allow a defaulting fiduciary to escape liability for loss which is causally linked to his breach. Another strand of authority, however, appears to endorse a more flexible approach to the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 The strict approach is justified by the need to deter breaches of fiduciary duty. In <span class="font-italic">Bank of New Zealand v New Zealand Guardian Trust Co Ltd </span>[2000] 2 LRC 357 at 384, Tipping J said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the second kind of case, the trustee or other fiduciary has committed a breach of duty which involves an element of infidelity or disloyalty engaging the fiduciary’s conscience – what might be called a true breach of fiduciary duty … [I]n such a case once the plaintiff has shown a loss arising out of a transaction to which the breach was material, the plaintiff is entitled to recover <span class="font-italic">unless the defendant fiduciary, upon whom is the onus, shows that the loss or damage would have occurred in any event, ie without any breach on the fiduciary’s part. </span>Questions of foreseeability and remoteness do not arise in this kind of case either. <span class="font-italic">Policy dictates that fiduciaries be allowed only a narrow escape route from liability based on proof that the loss or damage would have occurred even if there had been no breach</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 Unlike the strict approach, the flexible approach does not foreclose the applicability of the common law limiting doctrines if necessary to reach a just and fair result. In <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton &amp; Co </span>[1991] 3 SCR 534 (“<span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises</span>”), the plaintiff (the appellant) purchased land for development, thinking that it was purchasing the land from an original vendor. In fact, the seller was an intermediary who purchased the land from the original vendor and on-sold the land to the plaintiff at a substantial mark-up. The defendant was the plaintiff’s solicitor, who also acted for the seller. The defendant failed to disclose the fact that the seller was an intermediary to the plaintiff. It was agreed that the plaintiff would not have purchased the land had the defendant informed it that the seller was an intermediary. The plaintiff then proceeded to develop the land, hiring contractors to construct a warehouse on it. However, the piles supporting the warehouse began to sink, causing the plaintiff to incur substantial losses. The plaintiff sued the contractors for breach of contract but failed to recover the full extent of its losses as the contractors were not able to pay. The plaintiff then attempted to recover the shortfall from the defendant, alleging breach of its fiduciary duties. The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously held that the defendant was not liable for the loss, but differed as to the reasoning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 The plaintiff based its case on the argument that the concepts of remoteness, intervening cause and foreseeability had no relevance to an action for equitable compensation for breach of a fiduciary duty, and that the defaulting fiduciary was liable to put the aggrieved principal in as good a position as he or she would have been in had the breach not occurred (at [49]). Accordingly, the solicitor was liable for the construction losses, as the shoddy construction work on the land would not have occurred but for the solicitor’s breach of his fiduciary duties causing the plaintiff to purchase said land in the first place. The majority (comprising of La Forest J, with whom Sopinka, Gonthier and Cory JJ agreed) disagreed. They took the view that “it would be <span class="font-italic">wholly inappropriate</span> to interpret equitable doctrines so technically as to displace common law rules that achieve substantial justice <span class="font-italic">in areas of common concern</span>, thereby leading to <span class="font-italic">harsh and inequitable results</span>” (emphasis added) (at [87]). Thus, equity could draw from the common law where it was just and reasonable to do so (at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 It appears that the majority considered the construction loss to have been more properly attributable to the shoddy work of the construction company, which was an intervening cause unrelated to the solicitor’s breach of fiduciary duty (at [32]). Certainly, that was how La Forest J himself understood it in his later Supreme Court of Canada majority decision, <span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson v Simms </span>[1994] 3 SCR 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson</span>”), which reaffirmed the majority decision in <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson </span>at [80] – [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 McLachlin J (as she then was) concurred with the result reached by the majority in <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises</span>. She appeared to observe that an analogy with tort law ought not to be readily drawn in the context of a breach of fiduciary duty, owing to differences in policy undergirding tort and breaches of fiduciary duty: at [7]. Even then, however, she did not think that defaulting fiduciaries should be responsible for <span class="font-italic">all </span>the consequences associated with their breach of duty without limitation. She took the view that the construction loss claimed by the plaintiff in this case was caused by the contractors, and not the defendant. At [29] – [30], she said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The construction loss was caused by third parties. There is no link between the breach of fiduciary duty and this loss. The solicitor’s duty had come to an end and the plaintiffs had assumed control of the property. This loss was the result, not of the solicitor’s breach of duty, but of decisions made by the plaintiffs and those they chose to hire. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This result accords with common sense and policy. If fiduciaries on land transactions who breach their fiduciary duty were responsible not only for losses flowing from the fiduciary breach but for all wrongful acts associated with the property thereafter which cause loss to the plaintiff, they would not only be deterred from breach of duty, but rendered impotent … If such a result were necessary to protect innocent purchasers or deter misconduct, perhaps a case could be made for it. But it is not necessary as a policy of the law. The law gives a plaintiff other remedies. It is <span class="font-italic">fairer </span>that losses arising from construction on the property after the purchase be borne by those who assume responsibility for the construction rather than by the solicitor who acted in the purchase transaction. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 While McLachlin J did not use the language of intervening causes, it appears to me that the operation of the doctrine would be in line with her decision. There is no doubt that factual causation could be established between the breach of the defendant’s fiduciary duties (which caused the plaintiff to purchase the land) and the loss suffered by the plaintiff in respect of construction work on the land. The reason why the defendant was not found liable was because the loss was <span class="font-italic">more fairly attributed </span>to another cause (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the shoddy construction work of the contractors), which broke the chain of factual causation between the defendant’s breach of duties and the loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 It seems to me that under the flexible approach, the applicability of common law limiting doctrines to a claim for equitable compensation is qualified but not prohibited if needed to reach a just and fair result. Policy considerations, such as deterrence, could be considered in determining what a just and fair result should be. I observe that this approach is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([213] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). Indeed, the Court of Appeal appeared to favour a balanced approach whereby all the relevant rules and principles of common law and equity were allocated an appropriate “legal space” and utilized as and when appropriate in order to achieve a just and fair result in the case at hand (at [96]). For this reason, the Court of Appeal refrained from endorsing a strict interpretation of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Brickenden v London Loan &amp; Savings Co et al </span>[1934] 3 DLR 465 (under which the proof of causation in the context of equitable compensation would be irrelevant: see [238]), in favour of a burden-shifting approach (which balanced the need to deter fiduciary breaches against the need for fairness by shifting the burden of disproving causation on the defaulting fiduciary: see [240] and [244]). This appears to point towards the desirability of adopting a <span class="font-italic">flexible</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">balanced</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>rather than a strict, approach to the question of whether the common law limiting doctrines ought to apply in equity. <span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 That being said, under the balanced approach, both deterrence <span class="font-italic">and </span>fairness must be given due regard. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Winsta </span>underscored the importance of deterring breaches of fiduciary duties in the following terms at [246] – [247]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the starting point in equity is the trust and confidence reposed in the wrongdoing fiduciary by the innocent principal. The relationship between the wrongdoing fiduciary and the innocent principal is not one where both occupy equal footing, but rather one of dependence by the principal on the fiduciary. The principal relies on the fiduciary to act in his or her best interests, and is especially vulnerable to the fiduciary’s breach of duty. Indeed, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Kumagai-Zenecon (HC)</span> … has observed that a fiduciary owes his or her principal ‘the highest standard [of duty] known to the law’ …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In attempting to ensure that fiduciaries do not abuse the power given to them, and also to ensure that fiduciaries are not tempted or distracted from acting in the best interests of their principals, <span class="font-italic">fiduciary law has always embodied elements of deterrence and prophylaxis</span> … Equity intervenes not so much to recoup a loss suffered by a plaintiff as to hold the fiduciary to and vindicate the high duty owed to the plaintiff. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 The question is how deterrence can be accommodated within a more permissive approach allowing fiduciaries to escape liability for breach of their fiduciary obligations by invoking the common law limiting doctrine of intervening causes, while ensuring a just and fair outcome for each case. One approach is to consider whether it is necessary to serve the cause of deterrence by refusing to recognise the intervening cause of the loss in question. If not, there is legal space, in my view, to accord to the operation of the doctrine of intervening causes.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 McLachlin J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([280] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is illustrative. She considered it fairer that losses arising from construction on the property (the purchase of which was caused by the defendant solicitor’s breach of fiduciary duty) be borne by those who assume responsibility for the construction rather than the defendant solicitor because, “[w]here construction is concerned, it is their negligent conduct – not the solicitor’s – which the law should seek to deter” (at [30]). She did not think that imposing liability on the solicitor was necessary to deter the misconduct in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises</span> can be contrasted with <span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([282] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In the latter case, the plaintiff was a stockbroker who was inexperienced in tax planning. He hired the defendant, an accountant, to advise him on minimizing his exposure to income tax while acquiring stable long-term investments. The relationship between the parties was such that the plaintiff did not ask many questions regarding the investment advice given by the defendant. The defendant advised him to make substantial investments in certain Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (“MURBs”). Unknown to the plaintiff, however, the defendant was under a financial arrangement with the developers of the MURBs, whereby the fees he reaped from them would increase the more units in the MURBs he sold to his clients. Eventually, the real estate market crashed and the plaintiff’s investments lost virtually all their value. The plaintiff sued the defendant for the loss, alleging breach of fiduciary duty on the defendant’s part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 The majority in <span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson</span> found that the defendant had indeed breached his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff and was liable for the loss claimed by the plaintiff, even though, strictly speaking, it was the crash in the real estate market that directly occasioned the plaintiff’s loss. They distinguished <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on the grounds that, in <span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson</span>, the duty breached by the defendant was <span class="font-italic">directly related to the risk</span> (of adverse market movements in the real estate market) <span class="font-italic">that materialis</span><span class="font-italic">ed</span> and which in fact caused the plaintiff’s loss. The defendant had been retained specifically to recommend suitable investments for the plaintiff and could choose which risks the plaintiff would be exposed to. In <span class="font-italic">Canson Enterprises</span>, on the other hand, the defendant solicitor did not exercise any control over the risks that eventually materialized into a loss for the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Hodgkinson </span>at [82]). The majority also noted the need to (at [93]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … [P]ut special pressure on those in positions of trust and power over others in situations of vulnerability … Likeminded fiduciaries in the position of the respondent would not be deterred from abusing their power by a remedy that simply requires them, if discovered, to disgorge their secret profit, with the beneficiary bearing all the market risk. If anything, this would encourage people in his position to in effect gamble with other people’s money, knowing that if they are discovered they will be no worse off than when they started…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 In other words, the cause of deterrence would be served by disregarding the supervening cause of the plaintiff’s loss and holding the defaulting fiduciary liable for the same, because the duty breached by the defendant was directly related to the risk that materialised which caused the loss. Indeed, the defendant introduced the risk which caused the plaintiff’s loss in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 In my view, the principles set out at [287] and [291] would be sufficient to dispose of the issues in the present case, and I do not say anything further on whether a just and fair outcome would be achieved in cases where the various other common law limiting doctrines were to be disregarded entirely or applied in attenuated form in the interests of deterrence. I now apply these principles to the losses claimed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 Turning to the facts, it bears reminding that on 8 August 2016, the Crest entities brought Suit 856 in respect of an alleged attempt by IHC’s then management to transfer IHC Medical Re’s sole unit in the company holding the Australian business away to another subsidiary so as to deprive the Crest entities of the value of their security under the Geelong Facility. On the same day, the Crest entities obtained injunctive relief to prevent IHC from interfering in the Crest entities’ security. I should add that the purported transfer took place on 28 April 2016 – the day that the present proceedings were commenced by IHC. On 16 August 2016, the asset was transferred back to IHC Medical Re. Then, on 17 August 2016, IHC applied to set aside the injunction. Arising from that application, the 20 October Court Order was made in relation to the sale proceeds of the Australian properties. The commission for the banker’s guarantee was ordered to be paid by IHC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 In my view, the need for the banker’s guarantee was directly and primarily attributable to the plaintiffs’ own conduct in attempting to prevent the Crest entities from realising their security under the Geelong Facility by putting the assets of IHC Medical Re out of their reach. That was an intervening act which broke the causal link between Mr Fan’s breach and the loss, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the cost of the banker’s guarantee. Mr Fan’s breach of fiduciary duty (which concerned IHC’s entry into the Standby Facility) could not be said to be related to, or to have introduced the risk of the plaintiffs’ own conduct in this regard (which concerned how the plaintiffs dealt with the security under the Geelong Facility). The cause of deterrence would be adequately served without disregarding the intervening cause for the loss and holding Mr Fan liable for the same. I also note the plaintiffs’ position that the Crest entities have incurred unnecessary expenses of S$145,545.93 by obtaining the banker’s guarantee for the full amount: see [274] above. This appeared to be yet another supervening event (albeit for a portion of the loss). Holding Mr Fan liable may have the opposite effect, as it would encourage additional wrongdoing and unreasonable conduct by other parties as long as there is a defaulting fiduciary who could be held responsible for any loss.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 The same reasoning applies to the interest, default interest and exchange rate difference. Even by the plaintiffs’ own case, the loss was directly caused by the Crest entities’ unjustified charging of interest and default interest on the undisputed portion of the Geelong Facility up to July 2018, when they had the means to satisfy that debt when they received the surplus sale proceeds of the Australian properties on 26 February 2018. Again, there is no basis for me to conclude that Mr Fan’s breach of fiduciary duty was related to this risk of the Crest entities’ unjustified conduct. There is nothing to suggest that the cause of deterrence would not be served unless Mr Fan is held liable for this loss by ignoring its intervening cause. I note, however, that the Crest entities dispute that they were at fault, and allege that IHC was the party to cause the delay.

The question is whether these losses were caused by the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar conspiring to cause IHC to enter into and incur substantial liabilities under the Standby Facility. In my view, the plaintiffs have not proven that the losses are caused by the unlawful means conspiracy. In any event, these losses are directly linked to the parties’ conduct in the course of the dispute over the Geelong Facility. Thus, I do not think that this is the rightful basis to claim for the losses against the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ms Lim’s liability for breach of her duty of skill and care</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Payments towards the Standby Facility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 I have set out the applicable legal principles above at [216] onwards. In my view, it was entirely foreseeable that upon entry into the Standby Facility, IHC would make payments towards it (which it should not have been liable for). Accordingly, this type of loss was foreseeable and not remote: <span class="font-italic">Fong Maun Yee v Yoong Weng Ho Robert </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 751 at [57] (in the context of the tort of negligence, which is closely related to the breach of a duty of skill and care in this case). The requirement of causation is also, in my view, made out. If Ms Lim had exercised due skill, care and diligence in recognising that the Standby Facility had been drawn down even before IHC had formally entered into it, and made further inquiries, she would have been alive to the risk that the Standby Facility was drawn down in an irregular manner. Having known this, it was incumbent on her to exercise due skill, care and diligence in escalating the matter to the IHC board of directors, and if she had done so, it is unlikely that approval would have been given. Mr Siew, who cast the deciding vote, did so <span class="font-italic">only </span>on the basis that the Standby Facility was essential for IHC’s operations. In other words, IHC would not have entered into the Standby Facility, and would not have been held liable for any sum arising under the Standby Facility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 I accordingly find that Ms Lim is jointly and severally liable (together with the Crest entities, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar) for the sum of S$4,538,800.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss of use of payments towards the Standby Facility </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 I do not think that the interest which accrued on the Geelong Facility as a result of the application of the payments totalling S$4,538,800 towards the Standby Facility would be a foreseeable consequence of Ms Lim’s negligent failure to identify the true nature of the Standby Facility. Specifically, Ms Lim could not have foreseen that this would have led to a failure to pay the same amounts towards the Geelong Facility. Since Ms Lim’s knowledge of such consequences is not proved, I do not find her liable for this loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Losses in default of the Geelong Facility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 I am also unable to agree that the default on the Geelong Facility was a foreseeable consequence of Ms Lim’s breach. The default was attributable to a combination of factors. A major factor was the confusion caused by the Crest entities’ application of the sum of S$3,883,950 towards the Standby Facility instead of the Geelong Facility. This was not foreseeable by Ms Lim.

IHC had, in instructing her to assist in preparing the documentation for what turned out to be an illegal arrangement, breached the second implied term.

It was not good enough for her to claim that she had acted under instructions. In any event, I do not think that an indemnity in respect of such negligent breaches of duty can be implied into the terms of Ms Lim’s employment with IHC.

</div> I am inclined to agree with IHC that on the unique facts of this case, IHC had not been enriched at all. The outcome of <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III </span>([5] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is that the Standby Facility investors are the legal and beneficial owners of the 59,304,800 IHC shares which they bought and held using the sum of S$17,332,081.15 drawn down from the Standby Facility. On this basis alone, I am of the view that the claim fails. However, the parties’ focus was on the defence premised on illegality and public policy, and I turn to the question whether the court should allow the unjust enrichment claim brought to recover monies paid pursuant to the illegal Standby Facility. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defence of illegality and public policy </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">316 In <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua Siok Lui </span>[2018] 1 SLR 363 (“<span class="font-italic">Ochroi</span><span class="font-italic">d</span>”) at [132], the Court of Appeal stated categorically and emphatically that under Singapore law, “<span class="font-italic">there could be no recovery whatsoever pursuant to the illegal contract</span>” (emphasis in original). However, restitution of sums paid under the illegal contract on the grounds of unjust enrichment could be permitted provided that the ordinary requirements of unjust enrichment could be made out notwithstanding the illegality of the underlying contract, and <span class="font-italic">subject to the defence of illegality and pub</span><span class="font-italic">lic policy</span>: at [139]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">317 The Court of Appeal grounded the defence of illegality and public policy on the concept of <span class="font-italic">stultification. </span>Citing Professor Peter Birks in <span class="font-italic">Peter Birks, “Recovering Value Transferred Under an Illegal Contract”</span> (2000) 1 Theoretical Inquiries in Law 155 (“<span class="font-italic">Birks</span>”) at 160, the Court of Appeal explained that “[t]o stultify” is to “make nonsense of”. An unjust enrichment claim should not “make nonsense of the law’s condemnation of the illegal contract in question and of its refusal to enforce the illegal contract”. Therefore, a claim in unjust enrichment is precluded if to do so would undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the underlying contract void and unenforceable in the first place: at [147]–[148].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">318 In this connection, the Court of Appeal endorsed (at [158]) Professor Birks’ identification of two relevant factors which the court would take into account to determine whether allowing such recovery would stultify the policy that rendered the underlying agreement illegal. Firstly, allowing such recovery might provide a lever which future claimants in similar cases can use for the purpose of getting the other to perform the contract (the “lever argument”). Secondly, this might also stretch out a safety-net below all those minded either to engage in similar illegality or to abstain from diligently inquiring whether their proposed course of conduct would run afoul of the statutory provision or rule of law rendering the transaction illegal (the “safety-net argument”): see <span class="font-italic">Birks </span>at 162. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 As highlighted by the plaintiffs, in <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III </span>([5] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [53]<span class="font-italic">,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal explained that the rationale for the statutory prohibition within s 76 of the Companies Act comprises two core strands: first, the historical origins in maintaining a company’s share capital, and second, the wider concern of protecting the assets of the company. To allow the Crest entities to recover even the principal sum of S$17,332,081.15 would reduce IHC’s capital and assets, to the prejudice of the innocent shareholders and creditors. The plaintiffs argue that such a claim stultifies the fundamental policy of the statutory prohibition.

This, argue the Crest entities, suggested that allowing a claim for restitution in respect of sums paid out to a company to purchase its own shares does not stultify the policy underlying s 76 because Parliament clearly intended that restitution be available against the company.

</div> Also, the lever argument and the safety net arguments should be ruled in favour of the Crest entities.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">321 As I observed at [223], s 76A(4) of the Companies Act merely allows the court to grant just and equitable relief against a company. While it does not expressly preclude a claim against a company in respect of the sums paid out to the company to purchase its own shares, in the exercise of its discretion whether and what relief to grant, the underlying policy of the prohibition would certainly be considered by the court. What is clear to me is that statutory relief does not mean that stultification is rendered otiose (as suggested by the Crest entities). I turn to consider whether if allowed, the Crest entities’ claim for restitution would provide a lever for parties to enforce a contract which is illegal by virtue of s 76 of the Companies Act, or would provide a safety-net for parties neglecting to do their due diligence in determining whether the transaction is one that would run afoul of s 76 of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 The Crest entities’ case is that these two considerations did not arise. Firstly, they argue that allowing their unjust enrichment claim would not create a lever for future parties to a transaction illegal by s 76 of the Companies Act to enforce that illegal agreement, because it was not pleaded in such a manner as to recover the fullest extent of what they were entitled to under the Standby Facility, had it not been void.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 I am not sure I follow this argument. The Crest entities’ claim is for the full principal sum of S$17,332,081.15. It seems to me clear that allowing the unjust enrichment claim would create a lever for future parties (to a transaction illegal by virtue of s 76 of the Companies Act) to enforce that illegal agreement. This is the precise effect of allowing such a claim. It seems to me that a claimant seeking statutory relief within s 76A(4) of the Companies Act would also have to strive to overcome the same obstacle <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that relief may actually undermine the underlying policy of the statutory prohibition.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 Secondly, the Crest entities argue that their claim would not create a “safety-net” for other financiers in similar situations because IHC had provided representations and warranties as to the legality of the transaction, on the faith of which the Crest entities had entered into the Standby Facility. Also, allowing recovery in this specific case would not set a precedent which removed the disincentives against future financiers entering into such agreements by simply relying on general representations and warranties without conducting further due diligence, as the Court of Appeal’s finding in <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([5] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>would govern future conduct.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 The Crest entities’ position on the safety-net argument is, in my view, unsatisfactory. The argument is essentially premised on the assumption that the sole source of the Crest entities’ responsibility for the breach of s 76 of the Companies Act was its failure to do due diligence. Even if I were to accept the argument, the illegal transaction did not only consist of the parties’ entry into the Standby Facility. It also included the drawdowns on the Standby Facility to acquire IHC shares and the holding of the IHC shares by Crest as security for repayment: <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([5] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [134]. The Crest entities had effected the drawdowns on Mr Aathar’s instructions to purchase IHC shares directly. This completely bypassed the contractual safeguards in the Standby Facility agreement that would have prevented unauthorized drawdowns. As such, I take the view that allowing the unjust enrichment claim would indeed stretch out a safety-net to absolve the Crest entities and other similar claimants in its position from the consequences of its risky conduct. It is eminently desirable that parties do the requisite due diligence in both entering into as well as executing any arrangement involving a company’s direct or indirect acquisition of its own shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 Accordingly, I do not allow the Crest entities’ counterclaim in unjust enrichment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rectification of the default interest clause in the Geelong Facility </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 The Crest entities also sought to rectify cl 9.3, the default interest clause in the Geelong Facility, on the ground that it was erroneously expressed as 3% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> above the contractual interest rate instead of 3% <span class="font-italic">per month</span> above the contractual interest rate.

This is ascertained on an objective basis, by looking at “their outward acts, that is, at what they said or wrote to one another in coming to their agreement, and then comparing it with the document which they have signed.” Where a party relies on a unilateral mistake, he must show that he believed that the agreement contained all the correct terms, and that the other party being aware of the mistake, did nothing to draw it to his attention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 I do not think that the Crest entities have proven either a common mistake and/or a unilateral mistake which the plaintiffs did nothing to correct. There was nothing produced before me, by way of correspondence, documents or evidence of any discussion, to show that the parties specifically agreed for default interest to be charged on a per month basis. The Crest entities seek to rely on the surrounding circumstances, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> that the previous facilities provided for default interest on a per month basis, that the default interest on a per annum basis is but a negligible increase over the contractual interest rate which does not reflect the potential losses of the Crest entities, and that IHC never raised any dispute as to the default interest payable indicated in the statements of account sent to them after they had defaulted on the Geelong Facility agreement (which was calculated on a per month basis).

</div> However, these matters far fall short of proving an agreement of the parties in relation to the default interest for the Geelong Facility. There is also no evidence that IHC Medical Re knew that it was the intention of the Crest entities to charge default interest on a per month basis, or that it knew that there was a mistake in the document but did not point it out.
