On the same day, at about 5.44pm, the following message was sent from the Appellant’s handphone to Jasbir’s handphone: “05, 15. 02,42. 10,45. Each $10. Thurs. Ok. $30. Good luck.” These messages concerned the placement of an illegal TOTO bet by Jasbir. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Appellant and Jasbir had known each for about 15 years at the material time.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 1 September 2015, Jasbir pleaded guilty to a charge under s 9(1) of the CGHA, for placing a bet of $30 on an illegal TOTO lottery on 26 June 2014, amongst other offences. In respect of this charge, Jasbir was sentenced to a fine of $1,000, in default one week’s imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The trial below and the GD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At the trial below, the Appellant did not deny that the bet that Jasbir had placed was for an illegal TOTO lottery. However, he claimed that he was not the person administering the lottery, whom I shall call “the Bookie”, which is the common shorthand for “bookmaker”. The Appellant claimed to have merely forwarded Jasbir’s text to a bookie, one Kenny.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Prosecution, who is now the Respondent, argued that the Appellant assisted in the carrying on of a public lottery by receiving the illegal bet from Jasbir. It was not the Respondent’s case that the Appellant was the Bookie. Instead, the Respondent’s case was that the Appellant’s actions of accepting the bet from Jasbir and forwarding the bet to the Bookie for placement of an illegal bet amounted to assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery in contravention of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The central issue in this case was the meaning of the word “assists” in s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA. At the end of the hearing for this appeal, I concluded that s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) did not extend to the Appellant, who was merely helping his friend place a bet with the Bookie, without there being any evidence whatsoever of an arrangement of some kind, whether for commission or otherwise, between the Bookie and the Appellant, to collect bets on the Bookie’s behalf. Accordingly, I allowed the Appellant’s appeal against conviction on the Charge and set aside the sentence imposed by the District Judge. I nevertheless found the Appellant guilty of a lesser offence under s 9(1) of CGHA read with ss 107 and 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) and convicted him accordingly. My detailed reasons follow. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Appellant was the Bookie?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Before the primary question of whether the Appellant had assisted in the carrying on of a public lottery could be determined, there was a preliminary issue as to whether the Appellant was the person administering the illegal TOTO lottery, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Bookie. This issue arose because the District Judge had disbelieved both the Appellant’s defence as well as Jasbir’s oral testimony that Kenny, and not the Appellant, was the Bookie of the illegal TOTO lottery. This suggested that Jasbir had placed the bet directly <span class="font-italic">with</span> (as opposed to <span class="font-italic">through</span>) the Appellant and that the Appellant was the one carrying on the illegal TOTO lottery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 However, this finding is inconsistent with the Charge, as framed by the Respondent. The Charge requires someone other than the Appellant to be the Bookie of the illegal TOTO public lottery, and requires the Appellant to have assisted this person in the carrying on of this lottery. If the Appellant was the Bookie, he could not possibly have been <span class="font-italic">assisting</span> in the carrying on of a public lottery. He would in fact be the person providing for and operating the public lottery, which would then be inconsistent with the particulars of the Charge as framed, which state that the Appellant <span class="font-italic">assisted</span> in the carrying on of a public lottery (see above at [1]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I thus agreed with the Appellant’s submission that if the Appellant was indeed the Bookie for the illegal TOTO lottery, the proper charge should be a charge for an offence of acting as a bookmaker under s 5(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Betting Act (Cap 21, 2011 Rev Ed).

</div> However, that was not the offence for which the Respondent had charged the Appellant. Neither was it the Respondent’s case at trial that the Appellant was the Bookie of the illegal TOTO lottery (see above at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17  In the circumstances, in order for the Appellant’s conviction on the Charge to have stood, the Appellant could not himself be the Bookie. Therefore, the only question was whether the Appellant had assisted the Bookie in the carrying on of a public lottery. The Respondent similarly proceeded on this basis during the appeal and did not make any arguments based on the District Judge’s finding that the Appellant was the Bookie instead. This was entirely understandable given that, as the Respondent conceded, there was no evidence, other than the text messages referred to at [6] above, that the Appellant was the primary operator of the illegal TOTO lottery. The appeal thus turned on the single issue as to whether the Appellant assisted the Bookie in the carrying on of a public lottery.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Appellant assisted in the carrying on of a public lottery </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interpretation of “assists” in s 5(a) CGHA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Section 5 of the CGHA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assisting in carrying on a public lottery, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span> Any person who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) assists in the carrying on of a public lottery;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Appellant submitted that he did not commit the offence in s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA because it cannot be said that he assisted in the carrying on of a public lottery by simply receiving a bet from a punter and then forwarding the bet to the Bookie.

The majority of these cases however concerned decisions where the accused person had pleaded guilty to the charge and were thus not helpful on the interpretation of the word “assists”.

</div> In that case, the accused claimed trial to a charge under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA for accepting bets from friends and placing them with an illegal 4D lottery syndicate operated by a bookmaker named “Ah Gau”. District Judge Eugene Teo in <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Meng</span> made the following observations on s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) (at [35] to [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What constitutes ‘assistance’ is not defined in the [CGHA]. However, it is clear from a reading of section 5 itself that subsection (a) is meant as a “catch-all” provision. This is because some specific examples of assistance are set out in subsections (b) to (d). Assistance can be rendered in a manner beyond those set out there, and in such situations, subsection (a) would potentially apply.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Some guidance on the interpretation of the scope of the provision is provided in the case of <span class="font-italic">Lee Hwa Liang </span>v <span class="font-italic">PP </span>[1964] MLJ 172. This case involved a shop-keeper who displayed tikam boards for sale. Charged with assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery, he appealed after he was convicted before the Magistrate's Court. In allowing the appeal, Ong J stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The ordinary meaning of “assist” is “to aid or help”. “Carrying on a public lottery” is self-explanatory. ... <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">my opinion the demarcation line between assisting and not assisting is to be found in the nexus, or absence thereof, between the party alleged to be assisting and the party carrying on a lottery</span>. Common sense provides the answer. The vendor of any game or device capable of being used for a public lottery cannot in my view, be said to assist the purchaser in carrying on such lottery merely by reason of the sale. Further participation of the vendor in the purchaser's activities is a necessary ingredient of the offence. This is because they had no further connection one with the other after sale and delivery.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Eugene Teo DJ<span class="font-italic"> </span>then applied the “nexus” test to the facts before him in <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Meng</span>, and in doing so, took into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following facts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused knew Ah Gau and his activities. The accused’s punter friends also knew that the accused had a contact who was carrying on an illegal 4D lottery.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The accused agreed to help his friends place bets on their behalf with Ah Gau. In particular, the accused took details of their bets, after which he collected the wagers and passed them to Ah Gau. He would also help his friends who had won to make the winning claims with Ah Gau and also collect their winnings on their behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In light of these facts, Eugene Teo DJ then concluded (at [37] to [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In this context, <span class="font-italic">if we were to </span><span class="font-italic">then remove the accused from the equation, what would the result be? Would Ah Gau be able to carry on a public lottery for those punters? Would those punters be able to participate in the public lottery carried on by Ah Gau?</span> The answers to these questions would serve to show that the accused had a closer connection to Ah Gau than he cared to admit; one which went beyond being just another punter … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Common sense provides the answer; and in my judgment, the accused was intimately involved in assisting Ah Gau to carry on a public lottery for those punters – even if he did so without reward. On this basis, I determined that the present charge [brought under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA] still applied to the facts, and there was no need to consider possible alternative charge/s under section 8(4) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It was this passage which probably inspired the Respondent to submit that since the Bookie and Jasbir could not have dealt with each other but for the Appellant, the Appellant must have assisted the Bookie within the meaning of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA (see above at [20]). In my view, however, this argument—and the reasoning which inspired it—was flawed. While I agreed with the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Meng</span> (as the accused had been intimately involved in the public lottery ran by Ah Gau), I disagreed with the test adopted there because it cast the net too widely. This was because the test as framed would cover <span class="font-italic">any</span> instance of an accused’s involvement in the transaction between the punter and the bookie as long as the transaction in question could not have taken place without the accused’s involvement. This would thus also cover instances where the accused was only assisting the punter as his casual agent (see s 9(1) of the CGHA which references the buying of a ticket by a punter through an agent) as opposed to assisting the bookie in the running of his public lottery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Taken to its logical conclusion, this test would also catch an accused where the punter merely asks the accused to place a bet as his casual agent, with <span class="font-italic">any</span> bookie with the highest returns (which is conceivable as most punters are not as interested in the identity of the bookie as compared to the rewards they can potentially receive) and the accused, after some research, decides to place the punter’s bet with a particular bookie. In such a situation, the accused may have no prior relationship whatsoever with the bookie with whom he eventually places the bet, but yet would be seen as assisting that bookie under the test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Meng</span>. That would be an absurd conclusion to reach because the accused was clearly not placing the bet with the bookie for the purpose of assisting him. Even though technically the accused had indirectly “assisted” the lottery by getting it one extra ticket, the assistance was rendered for the purpose of helping the punter secure the highest returns and not the bookie. It cannot be the intention of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to cover such acts of assistance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(1) Assistance rendered to the bookie with the purpose of assisting the bookie </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my judgment, only assistance rendered to the bookie in the bookie’s public lottery operations is caught under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA. Implied from this is the requirement that the impugned conduct must have been for the purpose of assisting the bookie, though that may not be the only purpose behind the conduct. I take this interpretation of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for four reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, the concept of assistance ordinarily presumes some end or purpose to which the act of assistance is directed. The end or purpose which s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) prohibits is “the carrying on of a public lottery”. The words “carrying on” clearly mean the administration or running of a public lottery, not the mere participation in it. This rules out conduct which assists only the punter, who is a mere participant in the lottery. Even if such conduct may ultimately bring the bookie more business, that would not be a case of the accused assisting the bookie, but the bookie simply benefiting from the accused’s act of assisting the punter. Hence, s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) on a plain reading in my view requires the accused to act with the purpose of assisting the bookie. To be sure, I accept that to fall under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the accused can have that purpose concurrently with a purpose of assisting the punter or any other purpose; but the latter cannot be the only purpose which the accused has if the offence in s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is to be made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, my reading of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is supported by s 11(1) of the CGHA, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumptions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">11.</span>—(1) A person selling, offering for sale, giving, delivering or collecting lottery tickets or found in possession of 10 or more lottery tickets or counterfoils or duplicates of lottery tickets or of any account, memorandum, riddle or record of stakes or wagers in or relating to a lottery shall be presumed until the contrary is proved to be assisting in a public lottery then in progress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Section 11(1) presumes that a person is assisting in an existing public lottery when any fact stated therein is proved. It is telling from this section that the acts envisioned by Parliament as constituting assistance are acts performed by an accused to assist the <span class="font-italic">bookie</span> in the carrying on of a public lottery. Only a bookie (not a punter) would be concerned with acts of “selling, offering for sale, giving, delivering or collecting lottery tickets” in the course of carrying on a public lottery and may require the assistance of persons for such acts. Possession of counterfoils or duplicates of lottery tickets also relates to possession of materials likely to be used by or found on a bookie or the bookie’s runners than a punter or one merely assisting a punter. Therefore, persons who commit such acts for a bookie or who are found in possession of counterfoils or duplicates of lottery tickets are presumed to be assisting a bookie in a public lottery conducted by the bookie. None of the acts stated in s 11(1) concern actions where the assistance is rendered to a punter in punting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, although Parliament has not expressly stated the type of offenders s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA is intended to catch, some evidence of legislative intent may be discerned from the debates on amendments to the CGHA.

</div>
</div>
</div> (which was cited in <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong M</span><span class="font-italic">eng</span>: see above at [22]). To recapitulate, Ong J stated that “the demarcation line between assisting and not assisting is to be found in the <span class="font-italic">nexus</span>, or the absence thereof, between the party alleged to be assisting <span class="font-italic">and the party carrying on a lottery</span>” [emphasis added]. Thus, a nexus or link between the accused, alleged to be assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery, and the bookie, must be shown in order for a charge under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA to be made out. In my judgment, this nexus refers to the accused’s purpose of assisting the bookie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Such a purpose may be inferred from a variety of circumstantial evidence. The most common would of course be evidence of an arrangement between the bookie and the accused, whether for commission or otherwise, to collect bets or to perform some other act connected with the carrying on of a public lottery on the bookie’s behalf. Such an arrangement may in turn be inferred from the circumstances of the case such as the collection of bets from all and sundry on behalf of the bookie, text messages between the bookie and the assistor, or evidence of any commissions or other benefits received by the assistor from the bookie in connection with the assistance rendered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(2) Requirement of an overt act in connection with the carrying on of a public lottery</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Not only must it be proved that the accused had the purpose of assisting the bookie, the Prosecution must also prove that the accused committed an overt act in connection with the carrying on of a public lottery. This is borne out in the language of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of CGHA: “assists in the <span class="font-italic">carrying</span> on of a public lottery” [emphasis added]. Before tracing the genesis of this requirement, I should say that the relationship between act and purpose is a necessary and logical requirement. Where for example there is an arrangement between the accused and the bookie, there could very well be no acts committed by the accused pursuant to this arrangement. Where that is the case, it cannot be said that the accused has assisted the bookie. Or consider acts performed that have nothing or little to do with the operation of the public lottery. For instance, a bookie’s domestic helper, who only helps to do household chores in the bookie’s household, although is assisting the bookie, is not assisting the bookie in the carrying on of a public lottery. Such persons are clearly not caught by s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 This view is consistent with the case law (some even binding decisions from the Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements) on the predecessors of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). These cases are relevant because the offence under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) has not been substantively amended ever since its introduction. Before turning to these cases, it would be helpful to first set out the legislative history of the CGHA. In this regard, I found the following commentaries by Roland Braddell in <span class="font-italic">Common Gaming Houses: A Commentary on Ordinance No 45 (Common Gaming Houses)</span> (2nd Ed, Kelly and Walsh, Limited, 1932) (“<span class="font-italic">Common Gaming Houses</span>”) and Choor Singh, <span class="font-italic">Gaming in Malaya: A Commentary on the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance, 1953 of the Federation of Malaya and the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance (Cap. 114) of the State of Singapore</span> (Malayan Law Journal Ltd, 1960) (“<span class="font-italic">Gaming in Malaya</span>”) to be illuminating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Common Gaming Houses</span>, it was observed at pp 1 to 2:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first legislation against gaming houses in the Colony appears to have been contained in the Police Act, XIII of 1856 sections 56, 57, 58, 61, 62 and 63 and section 15 of the Indian Act XLVIII of 1860. Indian Act V of 1814 dealt with lotteries. All these were repealed and replaced by Ordinance XIII 1870 which dealt with the whole subject, <span class="font-italic">i</span>.<span class="font-italic">e</span>., both gaming houses and lotteries, under one Ordinance. Next followed Ordinance IX of 1876, XIII of 1879 and V of 1888.

This Act is the foundation of the successive Ordinances dealing with gaming in Singapore from the Indian Police Act XIII of 1856, through Ordinance XIII of 1870, Ordinance IX of 1876, Ordinance XIII of 1879 to Ordinance V of 1888 which has remained substantially unchanged and appears now as the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance (Cap. 114). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Subsequently, the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance 1953 (No 26 of 1953) was repealed and replaced by the Common Gaming Houses Act 1961 (No 2 of 1961) on March 1961, which then underwent further amendments before standing in its current form as the CGHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For the purposes of this discussion, I note that the specific offence of assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery was first introduced in s 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Common Gaming Houses 1888 (SS Ord No 5 of 1888) (“the CGH Ordinance 1888”) and read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span> Whoever––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) has the care or management of or in any manner assists in the management of a place kept or used as a common gaming house or <span class="font-italic">assists in carrying on a public lottery</span>; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be punishable with a fine not exceeding three thousand dollars or with imprisonment of either description for a period not exceeding twelve months. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the 1888 Legislative Council Proceedings of the Straits Settlements held on 1 March 1888, there was no express indication or any reasons provided by the Legislative Council for creating this offence other than to state that “they were not altering the present law; it was as in the Ordinance of 1879” (Straits Settlements, Colony of Singapore, <span class="font-italic">Proceedings of the</span><span class="font-italic"> Legislative Council</span> (1 March 1888) at B42 (Cecil C Smith, Governor of the Straits Settlements)). Apart from being re-numbered in subsequent legislation, this provision stood unchanged until 1971 when ss 2 and 3 of the Common Gaming Houses (Amendment) Act 1971 (No 25 of 1971) deleted the words “or assists in carrying on a public lottery” in the provision above and created it as a standalone offence, as it now appears in s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA. Thus, in the absence of any council or parliamentary debates as to why this change was made, it seems to me that this amendment was probably made to introduce clarity in setting out the offences since substantively the offence stood unchanged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In fact, as is evident from the above, the offence of assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery has remained substantively unchanged ever since its introduction in 1888 to the present. All the amendments relate only to changes in syntax and in the ordering of the sections, which do not affect the substance of the offence. Thus, the cases on these predecessor provisions remain relevant to interpreting s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA, which I now turn to address. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span><span class="font-italic"> v Regina </span>[1893] SSLR 117 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span>”), the accused was charged under s 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CGH Ordinance 1888 (see above at [42]). The evidence disclosed that he had in his possession papers relating to the Wai Seng lottery, which was an illegal public lottery. The Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements unanimously quashed his conviction on the basis that there was no evidence of an overt act by the accused in connection with the carrying on of a public lottery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 This was not only the only decision from that court to reach this conclusion (see <span class="font-italic">Common Gaming Houses</span> at p 90): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Regina</span> v. <span class="font-italic">Koh Si</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>decided on June 6, 1893, Bonser, C.J., quashed a conviction … because there was no evidence of any overt act committed within the Colony and in <span class="font-italic">Regina </span>v.<span class="font-italic"> Yeo Ong Leng</span> … the same ruling was given by another full court. The matter therefore is beyond all doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Relatedly, in interpreting a provision identical to s 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CGH Ordinance 1888, it was observed in the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Chong Chee Pak v Public Prosecutor</span> [1948] supp MLJ 45: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I interpret assisting in the carrying on as some overt act directly connected with the promotion of the lottery; whereas assisting in the management might extend to the printer who sells the paper or the workman who maintains the premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 These cases stand for the proposition that there will only be criminal liability where an “overt act” is performed by the accused <span class="font-italic">in connection with the </span><span class="font-italic">operation of a public lottery. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The next obvious question is: What constitutes an “overt act”? Few cases have considered this question. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Common Gaming Houses</span> at p 90:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Rex</span> v. <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng</span> and <span class="font-italic">Rex</span> v. <span class="font-italic">Liong Thy Hye</span>, Fisher, J., deals with the doctrine and in the latter case explains the meaning of the expression:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no magic about the word ‘overt’. An overt act is an open act which is evidence of the commission of the offence charged and which must be proved in an ordinary way.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Collecting money on a lottery ticket is not such an overt act. In <span class="font-italic">Reg</span> v. <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span> … Wood Ag. C.J. [in the lower court], held this and Fisher, J., adopted this ruling in <span class="font-italic">Rex</span> v. <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng</span> … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my judgment, an overt act is simply an open act committed by the accused in connection with the operation of the public lottery which he is alleged to have assisted. These acts must be related to the carrying on of the public lottery. They exclude acts that only tangentially relate to the public lottery, such as the buying of meals for the staff of the public lottery and the selling of goods at market value to the bookie that are used to run the public lottery. Examples of overt acts (which I provide here non-exhaustively) include promoting the lotteries, recording bets, collecting bets, paying out the dividends, chasing the punters for payment and financing or sponsoring the operations of the public lottery. In order to provide sufficient notice for the accused to meet his charge, the Prosecution must particularise this overt act of assistance in the carrying on of a public lottery in the charge faced by the accused, and the overt act must be proved to have been committed by the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As an aside, I found troubling the point made by the lower court in the case of <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span> that collecting money on a lottery ticket did not constitute an overt act. As reported in the headnotes of <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The appeal was argued before Wood, A.C.J. on the 24th October 1892, who considered that these papers “showed the Defendant to be a collector to collect money[”], but not in any “other way assisting in the carrying on of the lottery,” and “quashed the conviction[”] on the ground that, “though the collecting” of money was useful to the lottery, it required something “more to prove that the man assisted in carrying on the lottery”; but subsequently reserved the case for the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Although the Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements in <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span> appears to have approved these grounds stated by Wood ACJ, their approval was not clearly addressed in its reported decision. In making this observation, I am aware<span class="font-italic"> </span>that decisions made by the Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements are binding on me (<span class="font-italic">Ng Sui Nam v Butterworths &amp; Co (Publishers) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1987] SLR(R) 171 at [50]). In any event, the point on whether collecting money on a lottery ticket is sufficient to constitute an offence under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA did not strictly arise on the present facts because the Appellant did not collect any cash from Jasbir; he had only electronically received Jasbir’s instructions to place a bet for him with the Bookie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Having made these qualifications, I would respectfully disagree, as a matter of principle, with the view that collecting money from a punter, being the punter’s payment for a lottery ticket to a bookie, is insufficient to constitute an overt act in the carrying on of a public lottery. In my judgment, such an act is an overt act as it relates directly to the operation of the public lottery by the bookie. This was expressly contemplated by Parliament (see above at [33]), when it referenced the punishment received by <span class="font-italic">collectors</span> and runners for assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery. Collecting money from the various punters is in fact a quintessential element of any public lottery – a public lottery cannot exist and operate if moneys are not collected from punters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my judgment, what Wood ACJ probably meant in <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span> (see above at [51]) was that there was insufficient evidence in that case that the collection of the money by the accused had anything to do with assistance rendered to the bookie, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there was insufficient evidence to show that the accused had the purpose of assisting the bookie. The accused could have merely been given the money by a punter, who had asked the accused to help him in placing the bet with the bookie. In such a case, the accused would not have been acting with the purpose of assisting the bookie in collecting bets. The accused was merely placing a bet and paying the bookie, as an agent for and on behalf of the punter, and he was not collecting bets on behalf of the bookie. Accordingly, analysing <span class="font-italic">Leong Yeok</span> based on the first requirement of purpose, I read this case as failing on that requirement instead – even though there was an overt act, there was insufficient evidence adduced to show that the accused had the purpose of assisting the bookie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 To summarise, for the offence in s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA to be made out, two elements must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. First, the accused must have had the purpose of assisting the bookie in the carrying on of a public lottery. That purpose may be inferred from, amongst other things, evidence of an arrangement or understanding between the two that the accused would perform an act connected with the carrying on of a public lottery on the bookie’s behalf. Second, the accused must have performed an overt act of assistance in the carrying on of a public lottery.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Accordingly, s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA does not extend to an accused who merely helps a punter to place bets with a bookie (even though it constituted an overt act) in the absence of any evidence to demonstrate the accused’s purpose to assist the bookie. Instead, the accused’s conduct in helping to place bets would be caught under a different provision of the CGHA (see below at [69] to [70]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Appellant did not assist in the carrying on of a public lottery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In my judgment, the Appellant did not assist in the carrying on of a public lottery under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA. Whilst the Appellant performed an overt act in connection with the illegal TOTO lottery by receiving instructions from Jasbir for placing a bet, the first requirement of the requisite purpose to assist the Bookie in the illegal lottery was not satisfied. There was no evidence of any arrangement between the Appellant and the Bookie for the Appellant to collect bets on the Bookie’s behalf or do any other act in connection with the running of the public lottery to assist the Bookie. The Appellant was merely helping his good friend, Jasbir, to place a bet with the Bookie. In the circumstances, the Appellant cannot be said to have acted with the purpose of assisting the Bookie in the carrying on of a public lottery by collecting bets on behalf of the Bookie. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I agreed with the Appellant’s submission that the District Judge erred in finding that there was a “strong nexus” between the Appellant and the Bookie.

</div> It is not clear from the GD what role this fact played in his reasoning. It is an obvious leap of logic to say that the Appellant must have assisted the Bookie in the carrying on of a public lottery since they were good friends. But the District Judge could also be read as suggesting that since the Appellant and the Bookie were good friends, the Appellant must have known about the Bookie’s illegal lottery and consciously rendered assistance to the Bookie’s carrying on of that lottery by collecting bets from Jasbir. The District Judge did not, however, expressly make this inference. Neither did he have sufficient evidence to do so since this point was not put to the Appellant at trial. I therefore hold that the District Judge erred in deciding that there was a “strong nexus” between the Appellant and the Bookie.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In any event, I was not convinced that there was sufficient evidence of the Appellant’s purpose to assist the Bookie in the carrying on of the illegal TOTO lottery. Little to no evidence was adduced of any arrangement between the Appellant and the Bookie for the Appellant to assist the Bookie in his illegal public lottery operations. The Bookie was not called as a witness to testify for obvious reasons. In the absence of the Bookie’s testimony, there was also no evidence of any benefit received by the Appellant from the Bookie in connection with the bet placed by Jasbir, whether by way of a sum of money, commission, discount or otherwise.

</div> This meant that the Appellant was unlikely to have played any further role in the transaction between the Bookie and Jasbir after he had conveyed Jasbir’s bet to the Bookie. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 To complete the analysis, I would say that the position would have been different if there had been evidence of any arrangement between the Appellant and the Bookie for the Appellant to collect bets on the Bookie’s behalf. If there had been such an arrangement, the fact that Jasbir asked the Appellant to place a bet (even though they were good friends) would have been sufficient to secure a conviction under the Charge. This is because the court would have been entitled to draw the inference that the Appellant was not merely helping Jasbir as a friend but was also collecting a bet from a punter for the purpose of assisting the Bookie. This would be sufficient to constitute an offence under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA even though the punter happened to be his friend and he incidentally was also assisting his friend to place a bet with the Bookie. In the present case, there was of course no arrangement of the kind I have just described or any other evidence to demonstrate the Appellant’s purpose to assist the Bookie. Therefore, I found that the Appellant did not assist in the carrying on of a public lottery within the meaning of s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In view of this finding, it was not necessary for me to address the Appellant’s alternative argument that the illegal TOTO lottery in the present case did not constitute a public lottery under s 2(1) of the CGHA.

The Respondent argued that unlike the other provisions of s 5 of the CGHA, s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) did not limit its prohibition only to situations where the accused was assisting the bookie but also covered the situation where the accused simply received a bet from a punter (even as the punter’s agent) in connection with a lottery ticket. In other words, the Respondent interpreted s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) not to require a finding that the accused performed the prohibited act in assistance of the bookie in order for the offence in that provision to be made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 After considering s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in its context, I rejected this submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Section 5 of the CGHA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assisting in carrying on a public lottery, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span> Any person who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) assists in the carrying on of a public lottery;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) receives, directly or indirectly, any money or money’s worth for or in respect of any chance in any event or contingency connected with a public lottery or sells or offers for sale or gives or delivers or collects any lottery ticket;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) draws, throws, declares or exhibits, expressly or otherwise, the winner or winning number, ticket, lot, figure, design, symbol or other result of any public lottery; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) writes, prints or publishes or causes to be written, printed or published any lottery ticket or list of prizes or any announcement of the result of a public lottery or any announcement or riddle relating to a public lottery,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It can be seen from the various components of s 5 that the mischief which it intends to address is the assistance in the carrying on of a public lottery. For example, s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), as I have found above, requires the accused to assist the <span class="font-italic">bookie</span> in the carrying on of a public lottery. Sections 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) similarly contemplate the accused’s assistance rendered to the <span class="font-italic">bookie</span>, through either deciding or publishing the results of the lottery (see also <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Meng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35], cited above at [22]). The title of the section (see s 6 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 Rev Ed)) expressly provides that the section concerns “assisting in carrying on a public lottery”. It follows that the prohibited act in s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) must also be performed in assistance of the carrying on of a public lottery in order for the offence in that provision to be made out. The Respondent’s suggestion otherwise is inconsistent with the context of s 5 and therefore flouts the interpretive maxim <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis</span>, or “a word is known by the company it keeps”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Further, s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CGHA cannot be read as dispensing with the element of assistance rendered to the bookie, such that it can include the conduct of passing on bets on behalf of a punter to a bookie, without more. This is because that act is already caught by the offence of abetting the placement of an illegal bet under s 9(1) of the CGHA read with ss 107 and 109 of the Penal Code. The Respondent’s interpretation of s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is therefore inconsistent with the rule against surplusage. Further, that lesser offence is more appropriate as the culpability of a person who only assists a punter is generally lower than that of a person who assists a bookie. This is indicated by the lower maximum punishment for abetting the punter to place an illegal bet under s 9(1) of the CGHA read with the abetment provisions, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>six months’ imprisonment and a $5,000 fine, compared to the heavier maximum punishment for assisting in the carrying on a public lottery under s 5 of the CGHA, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>five years’ imprisonment and a $200,000 fine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Given that the offence under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA was not made out, I allowed the Appellant’s appeal and set aside his conviction and sentence in respect of the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conviction for a lesser charge under s 9(1) CGHA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 My decision to acquit the Appellant of the Charge did not mean that the Appellant was entirely innocent of any offence. The Appellant helped Jasbir to procure an illegal TOTO bet and he had to be punished for this act. Pertinently, the Appellant himself admitted at the trial below to committing the offence of abetting Jasbir to place an illegal TOTO public lottery bet.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  I thus decided to amend the Charge from s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to one under s 9(1) of the CGHA read with ss 107 and 109 of the Penal Code, which is essentially one of abetting Jasbir in placing an illegal TOTO bet with the Bookie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 With regard to the sentence, although the Appellant claimed trial to the Charge under s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CGHA, he had from the commencement of the proceedings against him accepted that he would be guilty of the offence of abetting the commission of an offence under s 9(1) of the CGHA. He only disputed that he had assisted in the carrying on of a public lottery. In the circumstances, I accorded him the leniency in sentence normally shown to one who pleads guilty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Having regard to the fact that the Appellant was untraced for similar offences, the range of fines between $1,000 to $2,000 imposed on first-time offenders pleading guilty for placing bets on illegal lotteries, and the fact that Jasbir had been fined $1,000, I sentenced the Appellant to a fine of $1,000 and in default, one week’s imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For these reasons, I allowed the Appellant’s appeal and set aside his conviction and sentence in respect of the Charge.

Accordingly, I found him guilty of the lesser charge and sentenced him to a fine of $1,000 (in default one week’s imprisonment).  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wee Pan Lee and Phipps Jonathan (Wee, Tay &amp; Lim LLP) for the Appellant;<br/>Terence Chua and Christine Liu (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Respondent.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
