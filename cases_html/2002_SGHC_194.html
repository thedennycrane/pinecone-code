<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></u></p>

<p align="justify">You, Mohammed Walik Shafiq Bin Adzhar Sah, M/17 years (S8505726Z), are

    charged that you on 20<sup>th</sup> April 2002 at about 4:20 am, at Blk 57 Marine Terrace,

    Singapore, did have in your possession of one light pink coloured mountain bike, which

    might be fraudulently obtained, and for which you failed to account satisfactorily as to

    how you came into possession by the same and you have thereby committed an offence

    punishable under section 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance)

    Act, Chapter 184.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The appellant was convicted

and sentenced to undergo reformative training. He appealed for a prison sentence instead.

I heard his appeal on 9 July 2002 and dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The facts</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The appellant is Mohammed

Walik Shafiq Bin Adzhar Sah, a 17 year old male. The facts of the case were not in

dispute. On 20 April 2002, at about 4.20 am, the appellant was spotted by a police officer

outside a shop unit at Blk 57 Marine Terrace, sitting on a light pink-coloured mountain

bike. The police officer approached the appellant with the intention to conduct a spot

check on him. However, the appellant rode off on the bike upon seeing the police officer

approaching. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        The police officer gave

chase and intercepted the appellant, who fell off his bike. He fled on foot towards Blk 13

Marine Terrace. The officer conducted a search on Blk 13 and detained the appellant on the

7<sup>th</sup> floor of that block.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Upon questioning as to how

he came to possess the mountain bike, the appellant informed the police officer that his

friend, one ‘Boy’ had lent it to him. The appellant was unable to locate

‘Boy’ and he was thereupon arrested on suspicion of having fraudulently obtained

the mountain bike. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Appeal against sentence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        The appellant pleaded

guilty to the charge before the Magistrate’s Court. Before this Court, he appealed

for a prison sentence instead of a sentence of reformative training. In passing sentence,

the district judge, sitting as a magistrate, was mindful of the fact that rehabilitation

is the dominant objective in sentencing a youthful offender. He weighed carefully the

mitigating factors of the plea of guilt, the recovery of the property and the

appellant’s youth. He also considered the aggravating circumstances, namely that the

appellant had previously been sent to the Singapore Boys’ Home for the offences of

armed robbery, putting a person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion, and

voluntarily causing hurt; as well as the fact that the appellant had committed the present

offence less than a year after his formal discharge from the Boys’ Home.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The judge, after

considering the foregoing factors, was satisfied that the matters mentioned in s 13(1) of

the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) ("CPC") were present. Section 13(1)

provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">13 – (1)    Where a person is

    convicted by the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment

    and that person – </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    is on the day of his conviction, not less than 16

      but under 21 years of age; or</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    is, on the day of his conviction, not less than

      14 but under 16 years of age and has, prior to his conviction, been dealt with by a court

      in connection with another offence and had, in respect of that other offence, been ordered

      to be sent to an approved school established under section 62 of the Children and Young

      Persons Act (Cap. 38),</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and <i><b>the High Court or District Court</b></i> (as the case may be)

    is satisfied, having regard to his character and previous conduct and to the circumstances

    of the offence of which he is convicted, that it is expedient with a view to his

    reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a

    reformative training centre, that Court may, in lieu of any other sentence, pass a

    sentence of reformative training". [Emphasis added]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The judge then proceeded to sentence the appellant to undergo

reformative training. In doing so, the judge rightly recognised the fact that under s

13(1), only the High Court or District Court may award the sentence of reformative

training. However, the judge fell into error in thinking that he held the sentencing

powers of a District Court due to his concurrent appointment as a district judge, even

though he was acting in the capacity of a magistrate in the present case. In <i>PP v Nyu

Tiong Lam &amp; Ors</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9818&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 273</a>, it was decided that a district judge acting in

the capacity of a magistrate only held the sentencing powers of a Magistrate’s Court.

The reason is that when the prosecution classifies a case as a ‘Magistrate Arrest

Case’ ("MAC"), as in the present case, it is tacitly invoking the

jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court. It is irrelevant that the judicial officer who

hears the MAC happens to be a district judge. Otherwise, it will be grossly unfair to an

accused, who may have chosen to plead guilty on the understanding that a "MAC"

classification means that the sentencing limits of a Magistrate’s Court applies. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        The correct course of

action for the judge to take in this case was to commit the appellant in custody for

sentence by a District Court under s 13(2) CPC. If the District Court, upon inquiring into

the circumstances of the case, is also satisfied of the matters mentioned in s 13(1) CPC,

it may then proceed to sentence him to reformative training under s 13(3)(a) CPC. It is

not within the powers of a Magistrate’s Court to sentence the appellant to undergo

reformative training without going through the District Court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The judge has therefore

exceeded his sentencing powers. In my opinion, this was an appropriate case for the High

Court to exercise its powers of revision, as conferred by s 268(1) CPC. One of the

purposes behind conferring powers of revision on the High Court is to ensure that any

sentence awarded by lower courts falls within their sentencing jurisdiction. This appears

clearly from s 266(1) CPC which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">266 –(1) The High Court may call for and examine

    the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of

    satisfying itself as to the <i><b>correctness, legality or propriety of any finding,

    sentence</b></i> or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings

    of that subordinate court. [Emphasis added]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        Towards this end, s 268(1)

specifically provides that the High Court, under its revisionary jurisdiction, may

exercise any of the powers under s 256 CPC which is otherwise exercisable only upon an

appeal. Section 256(b)(i) in turn provides that the High Court has the power to:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">…reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or

    discharge the accused or <i><b>order him to be retried by a court of competent

    jurisdiction</b></i> or committed for trial; [Emphasis added]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As will be clear by now, the court of competent jurisdiction in the

present case to award reformative training is the District Court, and not the

Magistrate’s Court. Therefore, under the powers of revision conferred by s 268(1)

CPC, read with s 256(b)(i), I ordered the sentence of reformative training to be set aside

and the case remitted to the Magistrate’s Court for the Magistrate’s Court to

commit the appellant in custody for sentence to a District Court under s 13(2) CPC.</p>
