<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is the administratrix of the
                    estate of the late Milakov Steven (“MS”). Dr Tong Ming Chuan
                    (“Dr Tong”) is a cardiothoracic surgeon who performed a redo
                    coronary artery bypass graft surgery (“the redo-CABG”) on MS on
                    12 March 2007. On 23 April 2007, 6 weeks after the redo-CABG, MS
                    passed away from post-operative complications. The plaintiff brought a claim in
                    tort and contract against Dr Tong, alleging that Dr Tong was negligent
                    and/or in breach of contract in relation to the medical advice, care and
                    treatment that he rendered to MS between 9 March 2007 and 23 April
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The trial before me was confined to the issue of
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff and MS were married in 1989.
                    Letters of Administration of the estate of MS were granted to the plaintiff on
                    22 March 2010 and the grant was extracted on 15 April 2010. The
                    plaintiff brought this action against Dr Tong for damages for the benefit
                    of the dependants of MS under ss 20 and 21 of the Civil Law Act
                    (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Civil Law Act”) and for the
                    benefit of the estate of MS under s 10 of the Civil Law Act. The dependants
                    of MS are:</p>

                            35 years old.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Dr Tong is a Consultant Cardiothoracic
                    Surgeon in private practice with over 28 years of experience in cardiothoracic
                    surgery. He practises at a clinic in Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. MS was
                    referred to and first saw Dr Tong on 9 March 2007. Dr Tong
                    performed the redo-CABG on MS on 12 March 2007. From 12 March 2007 to
                    23 April 2007 (“the post-surgery period”), MS was cared for
                    in the Coronary Care Unit at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. Dr Tong was
                    MS’s primary physician during the post-surgery period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       MS was 65 years of age at the time of his death.
                    He was an American citizen and held Permanent Residence status in Singapore.
                    Prior to his death, MS was engaged on a contractual basis by M/s Chevron Inc, a
                    multinational company based in the United States of America
                    (“USA”), as a consultant on matters relating to communication
                    skills, brand management and public relations. He was also an author of a number
                    of books and articles. His average monthly earnings were around $16,250 per
                    month when he passed away. MS had a history of borderline diabetes and
                    hypertension. Notwithstanding these conditions, before suffering his first major
                    adverse cardiac event (“MACE”) on 17 January 2007, MS had
                    been in good health. The plaintiff testified that MS led an active lifestyle and
                    was accustomed to exercising five or six times a week regularly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       For the purposes of determining liability, it is
                    necessary to understand the events leading up to this claim. The key medical
                    terms will be defined where necessary to facilitate understanding. The facts and
                    definitions are undisputed unless the contrary is indicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first MACE suffered by MS and the treatment he received at St
                Joseph Medical Centre, Houston (“SJMC”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 17 January 2007, when MS was in Houston,
                    USA, he experienced left-side back tightness accompanied by some nausea while
                    doing his normal routine physical exercise. This exercise routine comprised of a
                    walk which usually lasted about 45 minutes to an hour. After MS felt unwell
                    during the course of the walk, the plaintiff, who was walking with him,
                    accompanied him home to rest. As MS continued to feel unwell, the plaintiff
                    brought him to SJMC on the same day to seek medical attention. MS was diagnosed
                    as suffering from ischaemia (insufficient blood supply to the heart
                        muscles),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and angina pectoris (chest pain, a
                    symptom of ischaemia). These conditions are distinct from an acute myocardial
                    infarction (“AMI”) (more commonly known as a heart attack). MS did
                    not suffer an AMI on 17 January 2007. This was the first time he suffered a
                    MACE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       MS underwent a coronary angiography on
                    18 January 2007. A coronary angiography is a procedure to visualise the
                    coronary arteries. To conduct an angiography, the catheter is inserted into a
                    large artery in the groin or the wrist (in MS’s case, the femoral artery
                    was selected), <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> then
                    advanced to the heart and positioned at the mouths of the coronary arteries
                    before injection is performed. To see the coronary arteries, a special dye or
                    contrast medium is injected through the catheter. The dye will
                    “opacify” the vessels and thus makes them visible on the
                    angiogram. Coronary angiography may be said to be an invasive procedure. This
                    procedure is carried out to determine whether there is any significant narrowing
                    or blockage (“stenosis”) in the coronary arteries. Stenosis of the
                    vessels may be caused by coronary artery disease. Where there is stenosis, the
                    blood flow to the heart muscles becomes restricted, which in turn may cause
                    ischaemia, angina pectoris and AMI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The coronary angiography revealed that MS had
                    coronary artery disease and that the following blood vessels had become
                    stenosed:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the left main coronary artery
                            (“LMCA”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the left anterior descending arterial system
                            (“LAD”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the circumflex artery (“Cx”);
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the right coronary arterial system
                            (“RCA”).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     MS was advised by his doctors in SJMC to
                    undergo a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (“CABG”). A CABG is
                    a surgery which allows for coronary revascularisation. Revascularisation refers
                    to intervention to restore or improve blood supply to the heart. If coronary
                    revascularisation is desired, there are two procedures that may be performed,
                    namely, a CABG or a percutaneous coronary intervention (“PCI”).
                    The suitability of each procedure is dependent on the particular patient. The
                    aim of a CABG is to insert one or more grafts to the coronary arteries to bypass
                    the stenosed areas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This revascularisation will
                    help to ensure that an adequate supply of blood continues to reach the heart
                    muscles. This is important as oxygen and nutrients, which are vital for muscle
                    survival, are transported through the blood. To perform a CABG, the patient is
                    first put under general anaesthesia. The surgeon then makes an incision down the
                    middle of the patient’s chest and saws through his breastbone. The blood
                    vessels which are to be used as grafts will be harvested. The two types of
                    vessels commonly used as grafts are saphenous veins and internal mammary
                    arteries. The heart will then be stopped, and the patient placed on a
                    cardiopulmonary bypass machine. A cross clamp will be placed across the aorta to
                    prevent blood returning to the heart and a cardioplegia solution administered to
                    prevent cell death within the heart. The grafts will then be inserted. Following
                    this, the patient will be removed from the bypass machine. To complete the
                    surgery, the surgeon will stop any bleeding, wire the breastbone together, and
                    close the incision. As can be seen from this brief description of a CABG, the
                    surgery is a major one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On his doctors’ advice, MS underwent a
                    triple CABG on 19 January 2007 (“the initial CABG”). The
                    initial CABG performed at SJMC involved the insertion of three grafts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A saphenous vein graft (“SVG”) from
                            the aorta to a marginal branch of the Cx (“Graft 1”).
                            There was a dispute at trial about the position of Graft 1, but both
                            sides accepted that this was inconsequential.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A SVG from the aorta to another marginal branch
                            of the Cx (“Graft 2”).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A left internal mammary artery
                            (“LIMA”) graft to the LAD (“the LIMA-LAD
                            graft”).</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Recovery after the initial CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Following the initial CABG, MS made good
                    recovery, and returned to Singapore in February 2007. Upon his return to
                    Singapore, MS consulted his regular general practitioner, one Dr Michael
                    Chua, as his doctors in SJMC had suggested routine medical reviews.
                    Dr Michael Chua in turn opined that MS would benefit from regular check-ups
                    by a cardiologist and recommended one Dr Christopher Chew, an
                    interventional cardiologist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 23 February 2007, MS consulted
                    Dr Christopher Chew at his clinic. Dr Christopher Chew conducted some
                    tests on MS. MS performed within the acceptable range of results for the tests.
                    Dr Christopher Chew thus advised MS that he was recovering well and that he
                    could continue with his usual exercises and lifestyle. Even so, MS adopted a
                    more sedentary lifestyle and rested at home as he was on medical leave after the
                    initial CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second MACE suffered by MS and the treatment he received at Mount
                Elizabeth Hospital (“MEH”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At around 5.00am on 9 March 2007, MS
                    experienced some chest pain. He presented himself at the Accident and Emergency
                    Department of MEH for a consultation at around 6.00am and requested to see
                    Dr Christopher Chew. It is not disputed that on 9 March 2007, MS
                    suffered an AMI. This was the first AMI that MS suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Dr Christopher Chew examined MS and
                    performed a coronary angiography on him at or about 8.45am on 9 March 2007.
                    It is not disputed that the angiogram suggested that Graft 1 and Graft 2 were
                    completely occluded. The Cardiac Catheterization Report stated that a
                    “total block” had occurred in Graft 1 and Graft 2. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The occlusion would
                    mean that no blood could flow through those grafts, thus cutting off the supply
                    of oxygen and nutrients to areas of heart muscle downstream of the grafts.
                    Dr Christopher Chew opined that the AMI had been caused by the occlusion of
                    Graft 1 and Graft 2. With regard to the LIMA-LAD graft, there was a substantial
                    dispute at trial as to its patency. The significance of this dispute will be
                    seen in the discussion on whether the redo-CABG was an indicated and/or
                    appropriate treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Dr Christopher Chew then recommended that
                    MS obtain a surgical opinion from a cardiothoracic surgeon. MS was agreeable to
                    this and Dr Christopher Chew referred him to Dr Tong. At or about
                    12.00 noon on 9 March 2007, Dr Tong examined MS. It is clear that the
                    option of a redo-CABG was proposed by Dr Tong to MS at this first meeting.
                    The sufficiency of the advice given by Dr Tong to MS on the risks of the
                    redo-CABG and on alternative treatment options is disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 12 March 2007, Dr Tong carried
                    out the redo-CABG on MS. This was some 7 weeks after the initial CABG conducted
                    at SJMC. A redo-CABG is essentially similar to an initial CABG. It is, however,
                    a much riskier surgery, particularly when the redo-CABG is performed within a
                    short period of time from the initial surgery. The fact that MS’s
                    redo-CABG involved a higher degree of risk than his initial CABG was not
                    disputed by Dr Tong. After an initial CABG, the heart takes some time to
                    recover from the operation. There would be scarring of the tissues in the chest,
                    with adhesions between the heart and pericardium and between the pericardium and
                    the breastbone. The closer the proximity in time to the initial CABG, the more
                    highly vascularised the scar tissue and incision of such tissue would result in
                    a high degree of blood loss. Therefore, a redo-CABG performed shortly after an
                    initial CABG would involve heavier blood loss than the initial CABG. A surgeon
                    doing a redo-CABG would need to proceed slowly, cauterising the vessels to
                    minimise blood loss and would also need to proceed cautiously to avoid severing
                    grafts from the initial CABG that remained patent. This would result in an
                    increased entry time into the chest which would cause the redo-CABG to take more
                    time to complete than an initial CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     MS’s redo-CABG started at 9.00am and
                    ended at 6.55pm on 12 March 2007, <em>ie</em>, the
                    surgery lasted close to 10 hours. During the surgery, MS was placed on the
                    cardiopulmonary bypass for 333 minutes, and the cross clamp time was 140
                    minutes. Three new grafts were inserted during the surgery: two SVG grafts to
                    the marginal branches of the Cx and a right internal mammary artery
                    (“RIMA”) graft to the diagonal branch of the LAD. Following this,
                    the bleeding had to be controlled before the surgery was completed. The usual
                    methods of controlling bleeding, <em>ie</em>, an infusion
                    of platelets and fresh frozen plasma were administered to MS. However, these
                    failed to stop the bleeding, and 2.4 mg of Activated Factor VII (a clotting
                    agent) was then administered. This achieved haemostasis (the stopping of
                    bleeding). MS’s chest was then closed and the surgery
                completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After the surgery, MS was admitted to the
                    Coronary Care Unit at MEH. While in the Coronary Care Unit during the
                    post-surgery period, MS developed post-operative complications including
                    infection and sepsis which seriously compromised his health. On 23 April
                    2007, 42 days after the redo-CABG, MS passed away from multi-organ
                    failure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff particularised her claim in the
                    tort of negligence comprehensively under 17 sub-paragraphs. Broadly, her claim
                    fall under three headings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     First, the plaintiff claimed that Dr Tong
                    was negligent in recommending that MS undergo the redo-CABG. This claim centres
                    on whether the redo-CABG was an indicated and/or appropriate treatment for MS.
                    It is a distinct and logically prior claim to the second group of issues on the
                    duty to advise (at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>), as the patient
                    should only be advised about indicated and/or appropriate treatments. The
                    plaintiff claimed that the urgent redo-CABG in this case was not an appropriate
                    treatment for the following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Tong failed to adequately consider the
                            proximity in time between MS’s initial CABG and the proposed

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Tong failed to adequately consider

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Second, the plaintiff claimed that
                    Dr Tong failed in his duty of care to advise MS on the redo-CABG for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Tong failed to provide sufficient

                            only some 7 weeks after the initial CABG and only three days after his

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Third, the plaintiff claimed that Dr Tong
                    was negligent in the actual performance of the redo-CABG for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Tong failed to use retrograde

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Activated Factor VII should not have been
                            used.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiff also made corresponding parallel
                    claims based on the contractual duties which Dr Tong owed to
                MS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is noted that the plaintiff made no claim
                    with regard to Dr Tong’s post-operative care of MS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Dr Tong denied the plaintiff’s
                    claims. I summarise the salient points of the defence here. Where possible, I
                    have enumerated the defence to correspond to the plaintiff’s
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, Dr Tong averred that a redo-CABG
                    was indicated and appropriate for MS given his evolving infarction, poor
                    coronary condition and the complete occlusion of Graft 1 and Graft 2. He further
                    averred that PCI was not a viable option for MS. MS’s condition and
                    prognosis without the redo-CABG was very poor and it was more likely than not
                    that he would die within three years without the redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Second, regarding his advice to MS,
                    Dr Tong stated he had fulfilled his duty of care in advising MS for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">He had “warned MS that the mortality risk
                            of a redo-CABG was about 3% (<em>ie</em>, higher
                            than an initial CABG) and that there was also a small risk of
                            stroke”. Dr Tong further averred that based on his knowledge
                            and experience, it was reasonable to advise of a 3% mortality risk. (It
                            must be noted that Dr Tong’s case at trial on this point
                            diverged from his pleaded case);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">He had provided MS with sufficient information
                            about the morbidity risks associated with the redo-CABG;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">He had informed MS on 10 March 2007 of the
                            option to postpone the redo-CABG as MS’s angina pectoris had
                            resolved because of medical treatment; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">He had informed MS of the alternative treatment
                            option of OMT but also told MS that MS’s prognosis would be poor
                            under that option. Dr Tong advised that given MS’s poor
                            coronary condition, MS could proceed with the redo-CABG or risk further
                            angina pectoris and/or another AMI (which might lead to
                        death).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In addition, Dr Tong asserted that MS had
                    discussed the redo-CABG with Dr Christopher Chew and Dr Suelyn Chew
                    (the anaesthetist involved in MS’s redo-CABG) in separate consultations.
                    This was on top of MS’s discussions with Dr Tong
                himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Third, Dr Tong explained that the
                    redo-CABG was not carried out negligently for the following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Adequate steps had been taken to protect the
                            functionality of MS’s heart during surgery, including the use of
                            antegrade blood cardioplegia;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The surgery was long as it was complicated and
                            technically difficult. The sternum was densely adhered to the anterior
                            surface of the heart, requiring extensive time to free it. The coronary
                            bypass time (333 minutes) was long because the distal LAD was very
                            heavily calcified and the Cx was “stony hard” and could
                            not be grafted; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Activated Factor VII was required to stop the
                            excessive bleeding.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Much of the time at trial was spent
                    cross-examining the expert witnesses over the first thrust of the
                    plaintiff’s claim on whether the redo-CABG should even have been
                    recommended to MS as an option. However, the plaintiff’s written
                    submissions dealt largely only with the second thrust of her claim, that is,
                    whether Dr Tong was negligent in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG. The
                    plaintiff did not strenuously pursue the third thrust of her claim (concerning
                    the negligent conduct of the redo-CABG) during trial or in her written
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Nevertheless, the three issues to be decided
                    are as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">first, whether Dr Tong breached the tortious
                            and contractual duties of care he owed to MS in recommending that MS
                            undergo the redo-CABG;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">second, whether Dr Tong breached the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">third, whether Dr Tong breached the tortious

<p class="Judg-1">I will deal with the issues in the order set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal framework: the <u>Bolam</u> test,
                as supplemented by <u>Bolitho</u></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In Singapore, the legal framework for medical
                    negligence was set out by the Court of Appeal in <em>Khoo James v
                        Gunapathy d/o Muniandy</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1024
                        (“<em>Gunapathy</em>”). I am guided by
                    the approach taken in <em>Gunapathy</em> where the Court of
                    Appeal opined at [4] that it was
                    desirable to “set out the applicable law at the outset in order to keep a
                    tight rein on the arguments” before the court, as “the cart must
                    be put before the horse to prevent it from galloping off on an erroneous
                    tangent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Gunapathy</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal conducted a comprehensive review of the jurisprudence
                    following from the seminal case of <em>Bolam v Friern Hospital
                        Management Committee</em> [1957] 1 WLR 582
                        (“<em>Bolam</em>”), and affirmed that the
                    test laid down in <em>Bolam</em> (“the <em>Bolam</em> test”) and supplemented by <em>Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority</em>
                    [1998] AC 232 (“<em>Bolitho</em>”)
                    was the applicable test in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The well-known <em>Bolam</em> test comprises two limbs. The first limb provides that
                    when a situation involves some special skill or competence, the standard of care
                    the defendant will be held to is that of “the ordinary skilled man
                    exercising and professing to have that special skill” (at 586).
                    McNair J stated the second limb as follows (at 587):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A doctor] is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with
                        a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled
                        in that particular art ... Putting it the other way round, a man is not
                        negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely
                        because there is a body of opinion that takes a contrary view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Subsequent cases which interpreted and applied
                    the <em>Bolam</em> test had the unintended effect of
                    “[conferring] near-immunity to the medical profession from actions in
                    negligence” (<em>Gunapathy</em> at [58]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Bolitho</em>, the
                    House of Lords did a timely review of the second limb of the <em>Bolam</em> test and clarified that the court was not bound to find
                    for a defendant doctor simply because a body of experts testified in his favour
                    (at 241 – 242):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he court is not bound to hold that a defendant doctor escapes
                        liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads
                        evidence from a number of medical experts who are genuinely of opinion that
                        the defendant’s treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical
                        practice ... the court has to be satisfied that the exponents of the
                        body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical
                        basis. In particular in cases involving, as they so often do, the weighing
                        of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as
                        being responsible, reasonable or respectable, will need to be satisfied
                        that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the
                        question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible
                        conclusion on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     While the House of Lords was concerned to
                    emphasise that not all expert opinions would be accepted, it was also quick to
                    emphasise that it would be a <em>rare</em> case where the
                    opinion did not meet the threshold test of logic (at 243):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the vast majority of cases the fact that distinguished experts in the
                        field are of a particular opinion will demonstrate the reasonableness of
                        that opinion. In particular, where there are questions of assessment of the
                        relative risks and benefits of adopting a particular medical practice, a
                        reasonable view necessarily presupposes that the relative risks and benefits
                        have been weighed by the experts in forming their opinions. But if, in a
                        rare case, it can be demonstrated that the professional opinion is not
                        capable of withstanding logical analysis, the judge is entitled to hold that
                        the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a judge to
                        reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a competent medical expert
                        are unreasonable. The assessment of medical risks and benefits is a matter
                        of clinical judgment which a judge would not normally be able to make
                        without expert evidence ... it would be wrong to allow such assessment to
                        deteriorate into seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views
                        both of which are capable of being logically supported. It is only where a
                        judge can be satisfied that the body of expert opinion cannot be logically
                        supported at all that such opinion will not provide the benchmark by
                        reference to which Dr Tong's conduct falls to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Court of Appeal in <em>Gunapathy</em> (at [63])
                    opined that “<em>Bolitho</em> presented a timely
                    addendum to the <em>Bolam</em> test”, as it
                    “gave voice to a commonsense understanding which was hitherto unexpressed
                    – that the <em>Bolam</em> test did not
                    represent immunity from judicial inquiry over the medical process”. The
                        <em>Bolitho</em> caveat was that in order for an expert
                    view to qualify as a “responsible” body of medical opinion, it had
                    to satisfy the threshold test of logic. Therefore, the question was what the
                    threshold test of logic entailed and this was examined in <em>Gunapathy</em> at [64]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64 ... Lord Browne-Wilkinson described it as an essentially two-stage
                        inquiry and we would respectfully adopt his analysis. <em>The first inquiry</em>, according to the learned Law
                            Lord, <em>is whether the expert directed his mind at
                            all to the comparative risks and benefits relating to the
                            matter</em>. It is accordingly the process and not the result of
                        the expert's reasoning that is material in the eyes of the court. The court
                        must be satisfied that the expert had considered and weighed all the
                        countervailing factors relevant to the issue. Bare and unsupported
                        assertions in this respect would thus fail the test at this stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65 <em>The second stage of inquiry relates to whether the
                            medical expert had arrived at a 'defensible conclusion' as a result of
                            the balancing process</em> ... To our minds, a 'defensible
                        conclusion' connotes the satisfaction of two concepts. <em>First, the medical opinion must be internally consistent on its
                            face</em>. It must make cogent sense as a whole, such that no part
                        of the opinion contradicts with another. A doctor cannot say, for example,
                        that he supports a certain approach and attest that in that very situation,
                        he would nevertheless have done quite the opposite. <em>Second, the opinion should not fly in the face of proven extrinsic
                            facts relevant to the matter</em>. It should not ignore or
                        controvert known medical facts or advances in medical knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Court of Appeal also unequivocally stated
                    that “judges and lawyers should not play at being doctors” and
                    thus should not enter the fray that is the arena of divided medical opinion, as
                    the “lawyer-judge, while eminently equipped to follow such arguments,
                    finds himself quite out of his depth when called upon to adjudicate over
                    them” (at [3]). Therefore,
                        <em>Bolitho</em> cannot be understood to “herald
                    invasive inquiry into the merits of medical opinion”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Whether Dr Tong breached the tortious and contractual
                duties of care he owed to MS in recommending that he undergo the redo-CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The question of whether a particular medical
                    intervention is justifiable is the starting point of the inquiry. If the
                    procedure in question is not justifiable, then a patient would not need to be
                    advised of that procedure and, in fact, should not be advised of such a
                    procedure. The issue of whether the particular procedure is justifiable at all
                    must also be considered before the issue of whether the performance of that
                    procedure was negligent. <em>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional
                        Liability</em> (Sweet and Maxwell, 6<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    2007) (“Jackson &amp; Powell”) at paragraph 13-087 lists the
                    following considerations to be taken into account in determining this
                    issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether or not the intervention undertaken can be justified will be
                        determined by the extent of investigation, consideration of less
                        “invasive” regimes or management, and on expert opinion of the
                        appropriateness of the treatment used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While it is undisputed in the instant case that MS signed a consent
                    form on 11 March 2007, prior to the redo-CABG, a patient’s consent to
                    a medical procedure is not a defence in circumstances where no reasonably
                    competent medical practitioner would have proceeded at all. In <em>Doughty v North Straffordshire HA</em> [1992]
                    3 Med LR 81, the patient in question consented to the treatment
                    but the defendants were held liable under the <em>Bolam</em> test as no body of reasonably competent medical opinion
                    would have exposed the patient to such treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">MS’ coronary anatomy</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">MS had a left dominant coronary anatomy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Before going into the expert evidence, it is
                    necessary to have an appreciation of MS’s coronary anatomy. It was
                    undisputed among the experts on both sides that while most people have right
                    dominant coronary anatomies, MS’s coronary anatomy was left dominant.
                    While a left dominant coronary anatomy is not problematic in itself, it is a
                    feature that was unequivocally accepted by the experts to have had implications
                    for surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     A right dominant person has arterial blood
                    supplied to the left ventricle of the heart split proportionally among the three
                    main coronary arteries approximately as follows: RCA (25%), Cx (15%), LAD (60%).
                    The supply from the RCA to the left ventricle comes from the RCA’s supply
                    of blood to the posterior descending artery (“the PDA”), an artery
                    that reaches the crux of the heart and perfuses some of the left
                    ventricle’s muscles along the way. On the other hand, a left dominant
                    person’s PDA is supplied by the Cx and not the RCA. This means that the
                    RCA supplies negligible blood to the left ventricle, which then depends entirely
                    on the left coronary arterial system (“the LCA”) for its supply of
                    oxygenated blood. The LCA is the arterial system which includes the LMCA, the Cx
                    and the LAD (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). The Cx and the
                    LAD are smaller (but still extremely vital) arteries which are supplied by the
                    larger LMCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The left ventricle of the heart pumps
                    oxygenated blood from the heart into the aorta to be transported to the rest of
                    the body. In the words of Dr Richard Cooke (“Dr Cooke”),
                    one of the plaintiff’s experts, the left ventricle “is the most
                    important chamber” of the heart and also “the chamber upon which
                    life depends”. As MS was left dominant, his RCA carried negligible
                    amounts of blood to the left ventricle. His Cx, however, was dominant and larger
                    than in most cases, and compensated for negligible blood flow via the RCA by
                    supplying oxygenated blood to the PDA (which would be supplied by the RCA in the
                    more common anatomy of the right dominant person).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The upshot of all this is that while a right
                    dominant person’s Cx is responsible for around 15% of the oxygenated blood
                    supply to the left ventricle, MS’s Cx was responsible for almost 40% of
                    the said supply. It was thus clear that the continued viability of MS’s Cx
                    was vital.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The diseased state of MS’s coronary arterial system</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was uncontroversial that MS’s
                    coronary arterial system was severely diseased. We have already established that
                    MS’s LAD and Cx were responsible for most (if not all) of the supply of
                    oxygenated blood to his left ventricle. As explained above, both his LAD and his
                    Cx were supplied by the LMCA. From a reading of the angiogram, the expert
                    witnesses opined that MS’s LMCA suffered a 50% stenosis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I have explained above that coronary
                    angiography involves shooting dye through a patient’s coronary arterial
                    system in order to visualise it. An angiogram comprises a series of videos
                    (taken from different angles) of the dye passing through the patient’s
                    blood vessels. The experts were allowed to give a running commentary on
                    MS’s angiogram as they were being cross-examined in court. It was
                    demonstrated to the court that as the dye was shot through MS’s LMCA, the
                    visible dye flow tapered to 50% of its width at the mid LMCA. This allowed the
                    experts to determine that MS had a 50% stenosis at the mid LMCA. It was also
                    explained to the court (and this accords with simple physics) that a 50%
                    stenosis (<em>ie</em>, a reduction of the diameter of the
                    vessel by half) would correspond to a reduction in the cross-sectional area to
                    25%. Therefore, the blood carrying capacity of MS’s LMCA, which supplied
                    most of the blood to MS’s left ventricle, had been reduced by disease to
                    25% of its normal capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The non-viability of MS’s coronary
                    system was compounded by further disease in MS’s Cx and LAD. Dr Tong
                    stated that MS’s Cx was 99% stenosed at its ostium (<em>ie</em> where it originated from the LMCA). Dr Christopher
                    Blauth (“Dr Blauth”), one of the plaintiff’s experts,
                    was not prepared to accept the 99% figure, but readily conceded that the
                    stenosis was “definitely very tight”. As for MS’s LAD, while
                    the experts disagreed on the patency of the LIMA-LAD graft, it was
                    uncontroversial that the LAD system was diffusedly stenosed. The supply of blood
                    to MS’s left ventricle and the rest of his body was thus
                    compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of the plaintiff’s experts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiff called four experts, three of
                    whom I have already mentioned above. They were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Blauth, a consultant cardiac surgeon and
                            clinical head for cardiac surgery at the Cardiothoracic Centre at the
                            Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in
                        London;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Cooke, a consultant cardiologist at the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Sanjay Sharma
                            (“Dr Sharma”), a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at
                            Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dr Alan Patrick Whelan
                            (“Dr Whelan”), an interventional cardiologist at the
                            Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia in private
                        practice.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     This is an appropriate juncture to distinguish
                    between the job scopes of cardiothoracic surgeons and cardiologists.
                    Cardiothoracic surgeons, such as Dr Tong, are qualified to do open heart
                    surgeries such as CABGs and redo-CABGs. Where the procedure to be performed is
                    non-surgical, this will fall outside of the province of cardiothoracic surgeons,
                        <em>eg</em>, cardiothoracic surgeons do not carry out
                    PCI as it is a non-surgical procedure. Procedures such as PCI are more properly
                    within the province of interventional cardiologists such as Dr Christopher
                    Chew. Cardiologists do not perform surgical procedures. Cardiothoracic surgeons
                    and cardiologists thus complement one another and often work together in
                    teams.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff’s experts took the view
                    that a redo-CABG was not indicated and that Dr Tong breached his duty of
                    care by referring MS for a redo-CABG. In their view, MS’s condition had
                    stabilised in the days after his AMI. Dr Cooke stated in
                    cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was no reason to indicate that that lesion [referring to the Cx
                        ostial stenosis of 99% or so] was unstable. The heart attack had been caused
                        by thrombosis in the vein grafts and not by thrombosis in the native
                        coronary artery. The patient had no further chest pain after the heart
                        attack had been completed, so there were no clinical pointers to the fact
                        that that lesion in the native coronary artery may have been
                        unstable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In addition, the plaintiff’s experts
                    were of the opinion that the LIMA-LAD graft was patent and demonstrated
                    “brisk flow” into the distal LAD. The experts found that since MS
                    had no further angina once his heart attack had settled, his prognosis would not
                    be improved by an urgent redo-CABG. As the plaintiff’s experts considered
                    revascularisation unnecessary (at least, unnecessary at that particular point in
                    time so shortly after the AMI) they would have recommended that MS be put on
                    OMT. OMT is the most conservative treatment option for coronary artery disease
                    and does not achieve revascularisation, unlike PCI or CABG. OMT essentially
                    consists of an intensive regimen of medication and lifestyle changes to try to
                    reduce the likelihood of a further MACE like an AMI. OMT may involve the
                    administration of medication to control hypertension and/or thin the
                    blood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Even if revascularisation was deemed
                    necessary, the plaintiff’s experts thought that it should have been done
                    by way of PCI. PCI is a revascularisation procedure which involves the use of
                    balloons and stents to widen stenosed arteries and prevent them from subsequent
                    narrowing for as long as possible. A balloon will be passed through the coronary
                    arteries to reach the stenosed segments. The stenosed segment will then be
                    dilated with the balloon under high pressure, and stents placed in the arteries
                    to try to keep the artery open.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is uncontroversial that it is preferable to
                    carry out PCI when the stenting procedure is “protected”,
                        <em>ie</em>, when the heart is protected by a good
                    supply of blood from an additional artery while the stenting is being carried
                    out. The reason for this is that the patient is not placed on a bypass machine
                    while PCI is being carried out and, if in the course of the procedure, the
                    artery being stented becomes occluded, there will be no alternative supply of
                    blood to the heart and the patient would go into an immediate AMI. In the view
                    of the plaintiff’s experts, MS would be protected by the brisk flow
                    through the LIMA-LAD graft and a PCI would thus be a low risk procedure in his
                    case. Dr Cooke went so far as to suggest that the stenting procedure
                    carried an extremely low risk even if MS did not have a patent LIMA-LAD graft,
                    stating that the aforementioned risk of complete occlusion would be less than
                    0.1%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Dr Sharma also pointed out that the
                    redo-CABG was a high risk surgery for several reasons, including the possibility
                    of heavy bleeding due to the adhesions of the heart resulting from the first
                    CABG as well as the increased mortality risk arising from operating on a patient
                    just following an AMI. The plaintiff’s experts calculated the risk score
                    to be in the region of 14% from the EuroSCORE risk scoring system and opined
                    that Dr Tong’s risk estimate of 3% was a “considerable
                        underestimate”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The following excerpt from
                    Dr Sharma’s affidavit summarised the position of the
                    plaintiff’s experts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hence, I am of the opinion that advice to [MS] to undergo Redo-CABG
                        surgery was below reasonably acceptable standards expected of a reasonably
                        competent cardiothoracic surgeon in the circumstances. In fact the risks
                        involved in undergoing a Redo-CABG heavily outweighed the benefits the
                        patient would have received.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

                    was the only sub-issue under the first heading that the plaintiff substantially
                    pursued in her written submissions. It was uncontroversial that post-infarction
                    angina indicated the need for revascularisation. Counsel for the plaintiff
                    confronted Dr Tong and his witnesses with a pain flow sheet from the
                    hospital which showed that MS had not suffered pain after 10 pm on 9 March

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for the LIMA-LAD graft, Dr Tong opined
                    that MS did not have a good functioning LAD and that there was 90% stenosis at
                    the mid-segment of the LAD and a further 60% stenosis of the LAD distal to the
                    anastomosis of the LIMA-LAD graft (“stenosis of the distal LAD”).
                    This meant that the blood flow in the distal LAD was obstructed. When asked to
                    comment on this by Dr Tong’s counsel, Dr Christopher Chew
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">while the LIMA graft is patent and there is some flow to the circumflex
                        into the LAD system, that system itself was severely diseased and, in
                        conjunction with a dominant circumflex artery whose continued patency -- his
                        survival depended on the continued patency of this graft, <em>I was of the opinion that if that circumflex artery occluded, the
                            amount of flow in the anterior wall would not be enough to sustain
                            life</em> and, in fact, my concern from the very outset has been
                        this circumflex coronary artery, which was, in my opinion, the artery upon
                        which he depended on, his survival.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Further, Prof Buxton took the view that there
                    was “really a very poor flow” in the distal LAD, going so far as
                    to say that he would “regard that as almost non-functional”. When
                    asked whether MS had a protected LMCA, Prof Buxton’s reply was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Effectively, no, because I think there's insufficient flow proximally and
                        we can't see anything going up there at all and, secondly, the collateral
                        flow from that terminal distal LAD vessel to the circumflex system would be
                        insufficient to protect the left main or the circumflex.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     This view that MS did not in fact have a
                    protected LMCA had implications on the viability of PCI as an alternative

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 1a: Whether the flow of blood to the distal LAD was
                adequate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     One important area of dispute was the adequacy
                    of blood flow provided to the distal LAD. As stated above, Dr Tong’s
                    view was that blood flow to the distal LAD was inadequate. This diagnosis was
                    arrived at on the basis of Dr Tong’s reading of the angiographic
                    studies as well as MS’s clinical history presentation. Under
                    cross-examination, Dr Tong agreed that the stenosis of the distal LAD would
                    be a significant clinical finding. However, counsel for the plaintiff pointed
                    out that these findings were not mentioned by Dr Christopher Chew in
                    documents prepared prior to the trial, though he had the opportunity to do so on
                    three separate occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     First, in Dr Christopher Chew’s
                    affidavit, his only finding with regard to the LAD was that it was
                    “relatively small and diffusely atherosclerotic”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Tong then replied that Dr Christopher Chew had found diffused
                    stenosis of the LAD and that the only difference between his view and
                    Dr Christopher Chew’s view was that the percentage of stenosis was
                    not recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Second, in both of Dr Christopher
                    Chew’s two entries in the Clinician’s Collaborative Progress Notes
                    (“the Clinician’s Notes”) on 9 March 2007, there was no
                    mention of any finding of stenosis of the distal LAD. Dr Tong replied that
                    such findings would not be recorded, as they were not clinical findings, but
                    angiographic findings or investigative findings. He explained that clinical
                    notes were aimed mainly at noting the clinical appearance of the patient and how
                    the patient appeared in response to the treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Third, in the confidential medical report,
                    prepared about 10 days after MS’s death,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Dr Christopher Chew did not
                    discuss the stenosis of the distal LAD. In fact, Dr Tong himself did not
                    mention the stenosis of the distal LAD in his letter to Dr Christopher Chew
                    dated 29 April 2007, even though, at this time, he knew that the matter had
                    been made a Coroner's case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I considered these submissions but ultimately
                    found that Dr Tong’s expert witness, Prof Buxton, provided convincing
                    support for the medical view that blood flow to the distal LAD was inadequate. I
                    have already referred to Prof Buxton’s evidence at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There was a dispute between the
                    plaintiff’s and Dr Tong’s experts on the issue of whether the
                    blood flow to the distal LAD was adequate. To put the matter at its simplest,
                    the plaintiff’s experts said that it provided adequate flow while
                    Dr Tong’s experts said otherwise. One of the reasons for disagreement
                    was that the angiogram which was provided to the experts provided a
                    “non-selective” view of the distal LAD. When Dr Christopher
                    Chew conducted the angiogram for MS on the morning of 9 March 2007 when MS
                    arrived in the hospital after his AMI, he was only able to achieve a
                    “non-selective” shot of the LAD system in the angiogram. This was
                    because when Dr Christopher Chew injected the dye into MS’s
                    circulatory system, he was not able to place the catheter in the precise
                    location (<em>ie</em>, the orifice of the LIMA) which would
                    best engage the vessels leading to MS’s coronary arterial system. The
                    catheter in this case had been placed past the LIMA and was sitting in the
                    subclavian artery. This meant that there was a less than satisfactory amount of
                    dye shooting through MS’s coronary arterial system so as to opacify it and
                    make it visible in the angiogram. A non-selective shot thus provided a
                    sub-optimal view of the coronary vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Therefore, the angiogram gave only a very
                    faint view of the dye coursing through MS’s coronary arterial system. I
                    should say that the plaintiff did not take issue with Dr Christopher
                    Chew’s performance of the angiography, particularly given the emergency
                    circumstances in which the procedure was undertaken, but was concerned about the
                    implications of the non-selective shots. The lack of clarity in the view
                    provided by the angiogram was fertile breeding ground for legitimate
                    disagreement among the medical experts. The view that the blood flow to the
                    distal LAD was inadequate could not be said to be illogical. Accordingly, I find
                    in accordance with the <em>Bolam</em> test that
                    Dr Tong was not negligent to have held the view that blood flow to the
                    distal LAD was inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The view that there was an inadequate flow of
                    blood through MS’s distal LAD would lead a doctor to two further
                    conclusions. First, that the overall blood supply to MS’ heart would be
                    very poor. As MS was left-dominant, his left ventricle depended almost solely on
                    the Cx and LAD for its supply of oxygenated blood. However, his Cx suffered a
                    “very tight" stenosis at the ostium which would mean that the blood flow
                    through the Cx would be hampered. If the LAD also had an inadequate blood flow,
                    this would mean that the total volume of blood to MS’s heart might be
                    insufficient. The poorer the blood flow to MS’s heart, the greater the
                    need for revascularisation. Second, if MS’s distal LAD was receiving
                    inadequate flow, then it could not serve as an alternative blood supply to the
                    Cx to protect MS’s heart during the stenting of the Cx in a PCI. This
                    would thus cast doubt on whether PCI was, as the plaintiff argued, the superior
                    option for revascularisation and it is issue that I will now
                address.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 1b: Whether PCI was the superior option for
                revascularisation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     There appeared again to be genuine
                    disagreement between the experts on both sides regarding this point. The
                    plaintiff’s expert, Dr Cooke, clearly thought that PCI would be safe
                    even if it was carried out unprotected. While he acknowledged the nervousness
                    that many interventional cardiologists might have in carrying out an unprotected
                    PCI, he stated that medical views were changing:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On the other hand, Dr Christopher
                    Chew’s view was that MS was an unsuitable candidate for PCI. He stated in
                    his affidavit at paragraph 18:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subsequent PCI of MS’s own native ‘culprit” ostial Cx
                        lesion was also not favorable. The L[M]CA was itself diseased. This would
                        pose significant risks during passage of the balloon or stent towards the
                        Cx. The lesion itself was located at the ostium of a critical coronary
                        artery and undertaking PCI in this situation would have been
                        hazardous.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I should also point out at this juncture that when MS first saw the
                        doctors and surgeons at SJMC, they had also decided not to offer PCI. In

                    non-surgical option. Therefore, the decision to offer PCI is within the domain
                    of an interventional cardiologist and not that of a cardiothoracic surgeon.
                    Dr Christopher Chew, MS’s interventional cardiologist, had decided,
                    based on the angiogram, that the LIMA-LAD graft did not provide sufficient blood
                    supply as to protect MS’s heart and decided not to recommend PCI. On
                    cross-examination, the plaintiff’s expert, Dr Blauth, accepted that
                    it would not be unreasonable for a surgeon to accept an interventional
                    cardiologist’s opinion that PCI was unsuitable if that accorded with the
                    surgeon’s own judgment or if the surgeon took the view that the
                    interventional cardiologist had considered the matter and arrived at a sound
                        decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Moreover, counsel for Dr Tong also urged
                    the court to keep in mind that that when MS originally presented at SJMC on 17
                    January 2007 with angina, the doctors there found that CABG was indicated and
                    that PCI was unsuitable. At that stage, MS had only suffered angina but not an
                    AMI. Further, this was a case of angina occurring after exercise, as opposed to
                    angina occurring while at rest. The latter situation would have been greater
                    cause for concern. On cross-examination, the plaintiff gave evidence that
                    although MS preferred to defer the bypass and return to Singapore for the
                    procedure, he was advised by the doctors to undergo the initial CABG immediately
                    in Houston.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Turning now to 9 March 2007, when MS
                    presented himself at MEH, it was clear that his medical condition was worse than
                    when he had presented at SJMC on 17 January 2007. First, he had suffered an AMI,
                    a more serious cardiac event than mere angina, as the AMI had caused some of his
                    heart muscle to die. Muscle necrosis is irreversible and the muscle cannot be
                    revived even on revascularisation. Second, his Left Ventricular Ejection
                    Fraction (“LVEF”) had reduced from 59% in SJMC to 49% at MEH.
                    Third, he suffered the AMI despite being at rest, having adopted a fairly
                    sedentary lifestyle generally and rigorously following the medication regime
                    prescribed to him.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Therefore, counsel for Dr Tong argued
                    that if a CABG had been indicated in preference to a PCI when MS presented in
                    SJMC, <em>a fortiori</em>, a CABG would be indicated when
                    MS presented at MEH. I found this argument persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     On the evidence, I find that Dr Tong did
                    not breach his duty of care under the <em>Bolam</em> test
                    in deciding not to recommend PCI over the redo-CABG option. I also accept the
                    defence’s case is that it would be unusual for a surgeon to oppose a
                    competent cardiologist’s recommendation regarding the suitability of
                    PCI.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 1c: Whether Dr Tong’s risk estimate of 3% was
                such an underestimate as to amount to a breach of the standard of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I will now consider the question of whether
                    Dr Tong’s estimated risk of 3% was made negligently. This is separate
                    from the issue of whether the percentage figure was in fact conveyed to MS,
                    which will be examined later. On this sub-issue, the tenor of the
                    plaintiff’s argument was that the estimate of 3% was such an underestimate
                    as to show that Dr Tong did not properly address his mind to the issue of
                    risk and thus breached the standard of care to MS. The experts on both sides
                    proposed risk scores ranging from the lowest of 2.3% (by Dr Sin) using the
                    STS model to the highest of 14.34% (by Dr Sharma) using the EuroSCORE
                    model. These models are international risk scoring systems, created based on
                    data generated from various cardiac centres. For example, the EuroSCORE model is
                    generated from cardiac centres in Europe. Using one of these models is similar
                    to filling up an online survey form. Various questions about the patients are
                    asked and one chooses from a set of pre-determined answers. After all the
                    answers are entered, a risk score is generated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The risk scores generated by the models differ
                    on two counts. First, the questions in the STS model and the EuroSCORE model
                    differ, as do the specificity of the pre-determined answers available for
                    selection. Second, even when using the same risk scoring model, two different
                    doctors might select slightly different answers to the questions posed by the
                    model. This is because some degree of medical assessment of the patient is
                    required to select an option; and different doctors might have slightly
                    different views. I thus found that the EuroSCORE and STS risk models served only
                    to provide a “scoring guide”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> (in the words of Dr Sin)
                    in helping doctors to estimate risk scores for their patients. Risk scores
                    responsibly produced by different doctors for the same patient could
                    legitimately differ to some extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The arbitrariness of the risk models was also
                    highlighted to me. The EuroSCORE model defines left ventricular function as
                    “moderate” if its level of function is at 30 to 50%. MS’s
                    LVEF was 49%. By selecting “moderate”, MS’s risk score was
                    8.66%. However, if MS’s ventricular function improved ever so slightly as
                    to cross the 50% threshold into “good”, his risk score would be
                    dramatically halved to 4%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In addition, it is noteworthy that these
                    models are primarily used to assess cardiac centres, as opposed to assessing
                    risks for individual patients. Dr Sin is also the director of quality
                    management at the National Heart Centre and he explained that he primarily used
                    these models to benchmark the quality of his institution against other
                    institutions. The <em>primary</em> use of these models is
                    to tell hospital directors whether their cardiac departments are up to scratch.
                    However, the data from the models also helps individual cardiac patients to
                    estimate the risks of medical procedures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I also noted that while the EuroSCORE model
                    consistently produced risk scores in the region of 14%, the plaintiff’s
                    experts readily conceded that a well-known criticism of the EuroSCORE model is
                    that it overestimates risk. This was supported by a medical article from the
                    Netherlands Heart Journal aptly titled “Evaluation of the EuroSCORE risk
                    scoring model for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a
                    word of caution.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Finally, it was also uncontroversial among the
                    experts that personal performance data for individual surgeons were highly
                    relevant in estimating the risk for a patient. At the material time,
                    Dr Tong had encountered two mortalities out of 115 redo CABGs, giving a
                    mortality rate of 1.74%. When questioned about this, Dr Tong stated on
                    cross-examination that several of the patients in the “successful”
                    cases were actually higher risk cases than MS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> This could not be easily
                    challenged but Dr Tong’s above-par performance statistics as a
                    surgeon were undisputed and this stood him in good stead. Considering all the
                    evidence, I find that the risk estimate of 3% was not negligently
                made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 1d: Whether Dr Tong’s mistaken conclusion that
                MS had post-infarction angina or unstable angina was an irrelevant consideration
                that he should not have taken into account in choosing to recommend the
                redo-CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As stated above, the plaintiff alleged that
                    one of the factors that Dr Tong took into consideration in recommending the
                    redo-CABG was the ongoing angina pectoris suffered by MS. However, as clearly
                    evinced by the pain flow sheet,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> MS did not suffer any pain after 10 pm
                    on 9 March 2007 and remained pain-free until the time that he underwent
                    surgery. Although Dr Tong conceded this point,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>
                    he asserted, consistently with his other factual and expert witnesses, that
                    MS’s pain-free state was only achieved by placing him under medical
                    treatment. On the basis of his witnesses’ evidence, I accepted
                    Dr Tong’s opinion in this regard as reasonably and non-negligently
                    held.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It is apposite to note at this juncture the
                    plaintiff’s objection to Prof Buxton’s expert opinion that
                    Dr Tong was reasonable in proceeding with the redo-CABG. The
                    plaintiff’s objection was on the basis that Prof Buxton had been confused
                    about wrongly entered dates in the Clinician’s Notes. A 7.30am entry which
                    recorded MS as being comfortable overnight with no chest pain was mistakenly
                    dated 10 March 2007 when it should have been 9 March 2007. Prof Buxton
                    did not appreciate this until the trial. Reading this with the earlier
                    9 March 2007 entries which indicated MS suffered from angina, it might have
                    caused him to mistakenly believe that MS suffered unstable angina (<em>ie</em>, that MS progressed from not having angina to having
                    angina again), when the reality was that MS’s angina had resolved
                    gradually upon admission to Mount Elizabeth Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     However, on being cross-examined subsequent to
                    the clarification of his confusion about this, Prof Buxton continued to
                    emphasise the effect of pain relieving medications and qualified his agreement
                    that there was no evidence of post-infarction angina by saying that there was no
                        <em>clinical</em> evidence:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Even so, Dr Sharma, an expert witness for
                    the plaintiff, testified that scarring in the first six months would be very
                    vascular and thus opined that the “worst time to re-operate or to perform
                    a redo ... [was] close to the primary surgery”. I understand this to mean
                    that even if a redo-CABG was indicated to treat MS’s underlying coronary
                    disease, Dr Tong ought not to have carried it out on an urgent
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     However, it was common ground between the
                    expert witnesses that there was a risk of another AMI occurring and that this
                    could happen out of the blue, without warning. Dr Tong’s position was
                    that while the redo-CABG was being performed a relatively short while after the
                    initial CABG (45 days) and a short while after the AMI (three days), this had to
                    be balanced against the need for the redo-CABG and <em>the risk
                        that MS might die from a further AMI if he waited a longer period before
                        undergoing the redo-CABG</em>. As Dr Chew noted in his affidavit
                    at paragraph 29,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Essentially, [MS] had to take the risk of undergoing another major
                        surgery [<em>ie</em> the CABG] or take the higher risk
                        of another heart attack or sudden death if he did not go for the
                        surgery.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Prof Buxton described the medical situation as
                    a “<em>trade-off</em>” in his

                                            trade-off here, and that is that if a patient has had a
                                            big infarct, and we won't go into the symptoms of how

                                                allow any further damage to occur, so one is keen to
                                                move along, if one can, without compromising the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     What was perhaps the most evocative turn of
                    phrase came from Dr Sin on the stand:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I say "<em>a ticking time bomb</em>" to my patients.
                        I think that's probably more apt -- it's a time bomb. <em>Any
                            time it goes, it goes</em>. Even if I list you for surgery a week,
                        two weeks, three weeks, there's nothing to say that just a day before you
                        get a massive heart attack and don't make it in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The phrase “a ticking time bomb” clearly captures the
                    risk in delaying the redo-CABG. However, as will be expanded on in greater
                    detail later, this was a risk that could not be calculated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I also found the following paragraph from Prof
                    Buxton’s written expert opinion particularly illuminating:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[3].</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<b>Timing of Operation</b>
</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">A
                            dilemma in planning surgery with an unstable patient is the timing of
                            the CABG procedure. In general, the risk of early operation is high and,
                            the more unstable the patient’s condition the higher the risk.
                            This was the situation with MS at the point of the [re]do-CABG because
                            of the AMI he suffered prior to the redo-CABG. Many surgeons would
                            rather wait until the patient stabilises and the risk is lower. An
                            extension of the time of recovery before a redo-CABG may enable more
                            planning, such as the assessment of the coagulation profile, the
                            addition of anti-fibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid, and the
                            allowance of time for recovery post infarction. <em>On
                                the other hand, the risks of infarct extension or re-infarction
                                which can occur with little warning while waiting for the redo-CABG
                                may be serious or even fatal. Waiting is also attended with a risk
                                of ischaemia recurring during the critical time window</em>.
                            An intermediate course is to observe the patient’s condition and
                            continue a conservative policy as long as there are no signs of
                            deterioration. <em>There is no correct answer to this
                                dilemma. In MS’s case, he was managed aggressively by an offer
                                of surgery because the risks of further ischaemia and infarction
                                were estimated to be high</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Prof Buxton went on in the same paragraph to
                    note that MS was considered a “late” case of intervention:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Tong also waited till Day 3 (3 days after the initial AMI on
                        9 March 2007) before performing the redo-CABG, allowing MS to stabilise
                        through OMT. <em>Generally, an operation between Day 0 to Day
                            2 places the patient in the “early” group of intervention,
                            whereas an operation on Day 3 and beyond places the patient in the
                            “late” group of intervention</em>. In this clinical
                        situation Dr Tong’s decision to proceed with the redo-CABG was
                        reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The court was also referred to a Journal of
                    Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery article entitled "Optimal timing of coronary

                    The article documented a study by John Hopkins Medical Institution which
                    suggested that mortality risk for CABGs dropped notably three days after an AMI.
                    On the totality of the evidence, I find that the risk of a further AMI was a
                    significant factor that Dr Tong rightly considered in his decision to
                    recommend the redo-CABG.</p>

                    alternative perspective that the recovery instead gave a window of opportunity
                    to go ahead with the redo-CABG and this advantage had to be weighed in the

                    mean that if this opportunity afforded by MS’s improved health condition
                    was not taken to proceed with the redo-CABG, there was no guarantee that it
                    would still be available later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1g: The significance of the rarity of MS’s medical
                situation as a factor in Dr Tong’s decision to recommend the
                redo-CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The plaintiff argued that a redo-CABG in the
                    nature of what MS underwent was extremely rare for two reasons, which I have
                    termed “the two proximities in time”:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the proximity in time between the initial CABG
                            and the redo-CABG (about 7 weeks);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the proximity in time between the AMI and the
                            redo-CABG (three days).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, Prof Buxton stated that in his 30 years of practice, he had
                    done only one redo-CABG within six weeks of the initial CABG. He further stated
                    that in this one case, the patient had not also just suffered an AMI, as was the
                    situation in MS’s case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Dr Sin also conceded
                    that he had never encountered a patient in MS’s situation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> However, he
                    elaborated that although it was unusual for a patient to have a redo-CABG so
                    soon after the initial CABG, it was not unusual to have re-do <em>operations</em> within six weeks of open heart surgery and some
                    operations were even deliberately staggered in that way because the patients
                    were deemed to be high risk cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It can be seen that it is extremely rare for
                    a patient to undergo a redo-CABG where there is a coincidence of the two
                    proximities. Even so, I find that the fact of rarity of a redo-CABG in such
                    circumstances should not be given undue weight. The reason for such rarity might
                    be due to the reluctance of reasonable surgeons to proceed in the face of the
                    increased risks, which could support a finding of a breach of duty, or might be
                    due to the rarity of the coincidence of the two proximities in themselves, in
                    which case it might be argued that a redo-CABG in such circumstances amounted to
                    a desperate measure to treat a desperate situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As stated above, the plaintiff’s case
                    essentially boiled down to the assertion that reasonable surgeons in
                    Dr Tong’s position would have recognised that the risks involved in
                    undergoing the redo-CABG outweighed the benefits which MS would have received.
                    In 1921, Frank Hyneman Knight (“Knight”) published a book entitled
                    “Risk, Uncertainty and Profit”. He shared an insight which I find
                    helpful to the present analysis. Knight drew a distinction between risks
                    (outcomes with defined probability distributions) and uncertainties (outcomes
                    with undefined probability distributions). In other words, <em>we
                        know our odds when it comes to risks, but we do not when it comes to
                        uncertainties</em>. To my mind, MS faced a risk when it came to
                    proceeding with the redo-CABG, because the doctors could try to quantify the
                    probabilities of things going wrong. However, when it came to declining the
                    redo-CABG, he faced an uncertainty. As noted earlier, MS was akin to a
                    “ticking time bomb” with an unknown detonation time. At the end of
                    the trial, I asked Dr Sin what MS’s odds were if he were to decline
                    the redo-CABG:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I find the question of MS’ chances of
                    survival without going ahead with the redo-CABG simply an imponderable. The
                    plaintiff’s experts who said that MS should not have gone ahead with the
                    redo-CABG candidly accepted that a subsequent AMI might happen “out of
                    the blue”. It was common ground that MS had severe coronary artery
                    disease and it was thus not uncontroversial that a subsequent AMI might well
                    have killed him. The plaintiff’s experts did not put a figure to the
                    chances of that happening and I take it that they could not. If they could put
                    forward such a figure and show it to be significantly lower than the risk MS
                    faced in undergoing the redo-CABG, then Dr Tong would have breached his
                    duty to MS. However, it is precisely on medical imponderables such as the
                    present question that the medical community is allowed to have legitimate
                    disagreements without interference by the judiciary. By definition, it is
                    impossible to calculate imponderables and as stated at <em>Gunapathy</em> (at [3]),
                    “We often enough tell doctors not to play god; it seems only fair that,
                    similarly, judges and lawyers should not play at being
                doctors.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    It must be emphasised that the plaintiff
                    bears the burden of showing that the view held by Dr Tong was illogical. To
                    this end, the plaintiff noted that one of Dr Tong’s own experts, Prof
                    Buxton, stated that he would not have done the redo-CABG himself:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">However, it is clear that Prof Buxton was of the opinion that there
                    was a sizeable group of surgeons who would have operated as Dr Tong did,
                    and while he characterised them as “aggressive”, that adjective is
                    quite distinct from “illogical”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The plaintiff then relied on the following
                    excerpt from <em>Gunapathy</em> (at [65]) and submitted that since Prof Buxton
                    would not have proceeded with the redo-CABG himself, his medical opinion was not
                    internally consistent and should be rejected:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... To our minds, a "defensible conclusion" connotes the satisfaction of
                        two concepts. First, the medical opinion must be internally consistent on
                        its face. It must make cogent sense as a whole, such that no part of the
                        opinion contradicts with another. <em>A doctor cannot say,
                            for example, that he supports a certain approach and attest that in that
                            very situation, he would nevertheless have done quite the
                            opposite</em>. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    With respect, I think that is a misreading
                    of <em>Gunapathy</em>. The fact that a doctor acknowledges
                    the practice of one group of doctors while stating that he would have opted for
                    a different course does not of itself cause his opinion to become inconsistent.
                    The correct position, in my view, is that an expert can provide evidence of what
                    practices are accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men by stating
                    his view of what he believes other doctors would have done (even if he would not
                    himself have adopted that course). This is supported by the case of <em>Sharpe v Southend HA</em> [1997] 8 Med LR in which
                    Cresswell J stated at 303 (col 2):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An expert witness should make it clear in his/her report (if it be the
                        case) that although the expert would have adopted a different
                        approach/practice, he/she accepts that the approach/practice adopted by the
                        defendant was in accordance with the approach/practice accepted as proper by
                        a responsible body of practitioners skilled in the relevant field. Had this
                        guideline been followed in the present case it is likely that the
                        allegations against Professor Souhami would not have been advanced in the
                        first place (as opposed to being withdrawn in the plaintiff’s
                        counsel’s final speech).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Therefore, applying the <em>Bolam</em> test and after considering the evidence and arguments
                    presented by both sides, I find that Dr Tong was not negligent in
                    recommending that MS undergo the redo-CABG because he had acted in accordance
                    with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled
                    in that particular art. I also find that the medical opinions supporting
                    Dr Tong were held on a logical basis and satisfy the <em>Bolitho</em> test. In so finding, I find it apposite to recall this
                    passage from Lord Diplock’s speech in <em>Sidaway v Board
                        of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Maudsley
                        Hospital</em> [1985] AC 871 (“ (“<em>Sidaway</em>”) at 893:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Those members of the public who seek medical or surgical aid would be
                        badly served by the adoption of any legal principle that would confine the
                        doctor to some long-established, well-tried method of treatment only,
                        although its past record of success might be small, if he wanted to be
                        confident that he would not run the risk of being held liable in negligence
                        simply because he tried some more modern treatment, and by some unavoidable
                        mischance it failed to heal but did some harm to the patient. <em>This would encourage "defensive medicine" with a
                            vengeance</em>. The merit of the Bolam test is that the criterion
                        of the duty of care owed by a doctor to his patient is whether he has acted
                        in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a body of responsible
                        and skilled medical opinion. There may be a number of different practices
                        which satisfy this criterion at any particular time. These practices are
                        likely to alter with advances in medical knowledge. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of course, a redo-CABG could not be considered “more modern
                    treatment” but the point is that the court should not bind doctors to
                    conservative approaches in medicine as this would ultimately be to the detriment
                    of patients. Otherwise, there might be a chilling effect on the prescription of
                    more “aggressive” and/or interventional procedures, even if these
                    are reasonably thought to be in the best interests of the patient.</p>

                                            out of the HDU to meet -- because -- I think other than
                                            family no-one is allowed really in the [HDU], apart from
                                            the medical personnel, and Steve's colleague Brent Fish
                                            had when he was informed that this had happened, so I
                                            came out of the HDU to meet him, and while we were
                                            talking outside of the HDU, because he couldn't go in,
                                            Dr Chew came out of door and that's when we were
                                            standing kind of like in the corridor, you know, so to
                                            speak, and at that point in time we asked him, you know,
                                            "What are the next steps?" I'm using this very loosely,
                                            of course. He said, "There are two options. One is for
                                            conservative medical therapy and the other one is to
                                            refer a surgeon." <em>At which time he
                                                also told me -- well, he told us when a surgeon is
                                                introduced, a surgeon would usually like to operate,
                                                because that's how it is</em>. Okay? So that's
                                            what he said to us, and he said, "Those are the two
                                            options." He said, With conservative medical therapy,
                                            obviously some of the possible consequences could be
                                            some more heart attacks, myocardial infarct, and at the
                                            same time it could be also fatal."

<p class="Judg-1">The answer in italics could imply that, as a surgeon, Dr Tong was
                    inclined to operate whatever the circumstances and thus did not properly
                    consider MS’s suitability for the redo-CABG and did not properly consider
                    the non-surgical options of OMT and PCI, thus failing to meet the standard of
                    care expected of him. However, I find that if the plaintiff had indeed
                    understood Dr Christopher Chew’s statement to mean that Dr Tong
                    would perform the surgery, regardless of the circumstances and consequences, she
                    would not have proceeded to consult Dr Tong. I believe that the plaintiff
                    went ahead to consult Dr Tong with MS knowing that Dr Tong’s
                    approach would be aggressive and surgery-oriented, yet believing that this was
                    within accepted medical practice and a course which MS should
                explore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Having gone through the foregoing sub-issues
                    and making the findings that I have made, I accordingly find that Dr Tong
                    did not breach the tortious and contractual duties of care he owed to MS in his
                    recommendation of the redo-CABG as a treatment option for MS.</p>

                duties of care he owed to MS in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicability of <u>Bolam</u> to the
                issue of advice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The Court of Appeal in <em>Gunapathy</em> also considered the issue of the applicability of the
                        <em>Bolam</em> test to advice, noting the different
                    views taken on this issue in <em>Sidaway</em>. The
                        <em>ratio</em> of <em>Sidaway</em>
                    is not easy to determine, as each of the judges appeared to be taking slightly
                    differing stances on the applicability of <em>Bolam</em>.
                    One commentator has thus stated that “much rests on the subsequent
                    interpretation of the case” (Jonathan Herring, Medical Law and Ethics
                    (OUPS, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed) p 150).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In <em>Gunapathy</em>,
                    the Court’s interpretation of <em>Sidaway</em> was as
                    follows. Yong CJ noted the dissenting view of Lord Scarman that <em>Bolam</em> only applied to diagnosis and treatment and not
                    advice. Yong CJ then pointed out that the majority of the House in <em>Sidaway</em> parted company with Lord Scarman on this issue.
                    Lord Diplock, in the majority, stated (at 893) that the doctor’s duty of
                    care was “not subject to dissection into a number of component parts to
                    which different criteria of what satisfy the duty of care apply, such as
                    diagnosis, treatment and advice”. A doctor’s decision as to what
                    risks a patient should be warned of was stated to be “as much an exercise
                    of professional skill and judgment as any other part of the doctor’s
                    comprehensive duty of care” (at 895). Therefore, Lord Diplock opined that
                    “no convincing reason has … been advanced … that would
                    justify treating the Bolam test as doing anything less than laying down a
                    principle of English law that is comprehensive and applicable to every aspect of
                    the duty of care” (at 893). In <em>Gunapathy</em>
                    (at [137]), the court noted that Lord
                    Diplock had “entrenched the application of <em>Bolam</em> to advice in no uncertain terms”. Lord Templeman
                    was stated to have “effectively supported the <em>Bolam</em> test” even though he did not make specific
                    reference to the test (<em>Gunapathy</em> at [138]). Yong CJ went on to state (at
                        [141]) that “it was clear
                    that Lord Bridge [with whom Lord Keith agreed] did not agree with Lord
                    Scarman’s dissenting view that it was for the court to determine what
                    material risks a prudent patient was entitled to receive”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    However, Yong CJ noted that Lord Bridge did
                    carve a qualification into the <em>Bolam</em> test. The
                    question of advice and risk disclosure should not be abdicated entirely to the
                    medical profession. Yong CJ observed (at [141]) that Lord Bridge took the view that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">if a risk was substantial and there was no cogent clinical reason why
                        disclosure should not be made, the judge was at liberty to conclude that no
                        respectable medical expert would have failed to make it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was seen by the Court of Appeal to be “a forerunner to the
                    more general qualification made by <em>Bolitho</em>” (<em>Gunapathy</em> at
                        [141]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The Court of Appeal made clear that it
                    rejected the trial judge’s “unwarranted” (at [134]) interpretation of <em>Sidaway</em> as declining the view that the <em>Bolam</em> test applied to the issue of medical advice (see [142]). However, the court also clarified
                    that it was not providing a conclusive ruling on the doctrine of informed
                    consent since that issue was not fully vented in that case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">142    We would emphasise that this is not the
                            appropriate place to address a fully argued appeal on the merits of a
                            doctrine of informed consent. The issue did not arise in the submissions
                            before us and we would not pronounce on it as such. We, however, feel
                            compelled to address the judge's inexplicable assumption
                                that <em>Bolam</em> had been
                            unceremoniously evicted from the issue of medical advice, and to make
                            the observation that were this argument ever to arise in our
                            jurisdiction, it would find <em>Sidaway</em> ([57] supra) to be somewhat shaky ground
                            on which to stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nevertheless, what is important for the present purposes is that
                    the Court of Appeal went on to affirm that the <em>Bolam</em> test applied to the issue of advice at [143]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">143    Accordingly, <em>in affirming that
                                the Bolam test applied to the issue of advice in the
                                present appeal</em>, we found that the defendant
                            doctors’ disclosure of the relevant percentage risks of
                            radiosurgery was <em>supported by a respectable body of
                                medical opinion</em>. They had not given negligent advice to
                            Gunapathy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s proposed test for the issue of advice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    While counsel for the plaintiff appears to
                    accept that <em>Bolam</em>, subject to the <em>Bolitho</em> caveat, applied to advice, his submission of
                    what the <em>Bolitho</em> threshold of logic entails might
                    result in a departure from the <em>Bolam</em> test in
                    effect. According to the plaintiff, if the doctor failed to communicate a
                    significant risk to the patient before carrying out the recommended treatment,
                    this would fail to meet the <em>Bolitho</em> threshold of
                    logic and such a failure “would [be] tantamount to the conduct being
                    illogical, irresponsible or unreasonable” and thus amount to a breach of
                    the doctor’s duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The plaintiff derived this argument from
                    what she saw as the English approach of using <em>Bolitho</em> as “providing sufficient ammunition to the courts
                    to scrutinise and find liability” even when Dr Tong attempted to
                    adduce evidence that his practice conforms to the practice of a respectable body
                    of practitioners. To illustrate this, the plaintiff referred to the decision in
                        <em>Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust</em>
                    [1999] ECC 167 (“<em>Pearce</em>”)
                    where Lord Woolf held (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a case where it is being alleged that a plaintiff has been deprived of
                        the opportunity to make a proper decision as to what course he or she should
                        take in relation to treatment, it seems to me to be the law, as indicated in
                        the cases to which I have just referred, that <em>if there is
                            a significant risk which would affect the judgment of a reasonable
                            patient, then in the normal course it is the responsibility of a doctor
                            to inform the patient of that significant risk</em>, if the
                        information is needed so that the patient can determine for him or herself
                        as to what course he or she should adopt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The plaintiff noted that <em>Pearce</em> was characterised by some commentators as being closer to
                    the “reasonable patient” test in the Australian case of <em>Rogers v Whitaker</em> [1992] 175 CLR 479
                        (<em>“Rogers</em>”) than to the
                    traditional English approach which focuses on the “reasonable
                    doctor”, or more accurately, a “responsible body of medical
                    opinion” (Jackson &amp; Powell at paragraph 13-091). In <em>Rogers</em>, the High Court of Australia departed from the
                        <em>Bolam</em> test (at least in respect of the duty to
                    advise) in favour of the approach of the Supreme Court of Canada
                        in <em>Reibl v Hughes</em> (1980)
                    114 DLR (3d) 1, holding (at 490) that a doctor had a duty to warn
                    his patient of the material risks inherent in the proposed medical treatment. A
                    risk was material if, in the circumstances of the case, (i) a reasonable person
                    in the patient’s position, if warned of the risk, would be likely to
                    attach significance to it; or (ii) if the medical practitioner is or should be
                    reasonably aware that the particular patient, if warned of the risk, would be
                    likely to attach significance to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Later, in <em>Rosenberg v
                        Percival</em> [2001] 205 CLR 434, the High Court of
                    Australia affirmed <em>Rogers</em> and reiterated that
                    Australian law had moved away from the <em>Bolam</em> test
                    in respect of the issue of advice. The plaintiff went on to note that the
                    position adopted in Australia had found favour with the Malaysian courts, and
                    referred to <em>Foo Fio Na v Dr Soo Fook Mun and
                        Anor</em> [2007] 1 MLJ 593 (“<em>Foo
                        Fio Na</em>”), where the Federal Court of Malaysia endorsed the
                        <em>Rogers</em> approach in preference to the <em>Bolam</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The defence submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s reliance on the cases from other jurisdictions which showed a
                    movement away from <em>Bolam</em> in respect of the issue
                    of advice was misguided for the following reasons. First, some of the key
                    authorities relied on by the plaintiff had already been expressly rejected by
                    the Singapore High Court in <em>Surender Singh</em> (per
                    Lai Siu Chiu J) on account that it was bound by the Court of Appeal
                    decision in <em>Gunapathy</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">152    In recent times however, the <em>Bolam</em> approach has come under fire in
                            several jurisdictions, most notably in Australia and Canada.
                                In [<em>Rogers</em>], the High Court of
                            Australia explicitly rejected <em>Bolam</em> (at least in relation to the duty of disclosure
                            and advice) in favour of the approach of the Supreme Court of Canada
                                in <em>Reibl v Hughes</em> (1980)
                            114 DLR (3d) 1. Recent Malaysian decisions have also followed
                            the Australian approach and in [<em>Foo Fio
                                Na</em>], the Federal Court finally rejected <em>Bolam</em>, preferring <em>Rogers</em> as the applicable test for assessing all
                            forms of medical negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">153    
              <em>However, the law as it stands
                                in Singapore and that which will be applied in this judgment,
                                is Gunapathy's case</em>, [the Court then proceeded to
                            read key paragraphs of <em>Gunapathy</em>, which
                            have been set out earlier in this judgment, emphasising that the
                            applicable test is the <em>Bolam</em> test as
                            qualified by the <em>Bolitho</em> test of
                            logic]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Second, the highest the plaintiff had put
                    her case was that there appeared to be a reluctance in the English courts in
                    more recent years to apply <em>Bolam</em> and the majority
                    view in <em>Sidaway</em>. However, the defence noted that
                    in <em>Pearce</em>, the court had expressly applied
                        <em>Sidaway</em>. In this regard, I also observed that
                    notwithstanding his language which appeared to lean towards defining liability
                    by reference to the reasonable patient, Lord Woolf expressly accepted as law (at
                        [18]) a passage of Lord
                    Templeman’s speech in <em>Sidaway</em> which
                    emphasised the problems of providing a patient with too much information:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Templeman did not adopt quite the same approach as
                        either Lord Scarman or the majority, but his speech is particularly relied
                        upon by Mr Richardson. I bear that in mind, but I would merely refer to one
                        short passage at page 904:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“If the doctor making a balanced judgment advises the patient
                            to submit to the operation, the patient is entitled to reject that
                            advice for reasons which are rational, or irrational, or for no reason.
                            The duty of the doctor in these circumstances, subject to his overriding
                            duty to have regard to the best interests of the patient, is to provide
                            the patient with information which will enable the patient to make a
                            balanced judgment if the patient chooses to make a balanced judgment. A
                            patient may make an unbalanced judgment because he is deprived of
                            adequate information. <em>A patient may also make an
                                unbalanced judgment if he is provided with too much information and
                                is made aware of possibilities which he is not capable of assessing
                                because of his lack of medical training, his prejudices or his
                                personality.”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While recognising that Lord Templeman's approach is not precisely that of
                        the majority, <em>it seems to me that that statement of Lord
                            Templeman does reflect the law</em> and does not involve taking a
                        different view from the majority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Further, although cases like <em>Chester v Afshar</em> [2005] 1 AC 134
                        (“<em>Chester</em>”) suggested that the
                    perspective of a reasonable patient should be adopted, this case did not assist
                    the plaintiff. <em>Chester</em> was a case on causation and
                    not the duty and standards of advice and the comments on the standard of care
                    were thus <em>obiter</em>. Even so, it must be remembered
                    that <em>Bolitho</em> was also a case on causation and the
                    important <em>obiter</em> remarks have been widely accepted
                    as supplementing the <em>Bolam</em> test on breach of duty.
                    More pertinently, the comments in <em>Chester</em> may not
                    be applicable in Singapore, as the judgment’s emphasis on human rights and
                    autonomy might be attributed to the binding effect of the European Convention of
                    Human Rights on the English courts pursuant to the Human Rights Act 1998, which
                    Singapore is not bound by.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The plaintiff’s characterisation of
                    the threshold of logic looks like an attempt to abolish <em>Bolam’s</em> applicability to the issue of advice. This is at
                    odds with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Gunapathy</em> which makes it clear that the <em>Bolam</em> and <em>Bolitho</em> jurisprudence
                    applies to the issue of advice. <em>Gunapathy</em> is
                    binding on me. I do agree with the plaintiff that if the medical profession
                    illogically omits to warn of certain risks which patients should undoubtedly be
                    informed of, then the court should interfere on the authority of <em>Bolitho</em>. In this regard, I turn to a passage from the
                    speech of Lord Bridge in <em>Sidaway</em> (at 900), where
                    he was one of the majority judges:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But even in a case where, as here, no expert witness in the relevant
                        medical field condemns the non-disclosure as being in conflict with accepted
                        and responsible medical practice, <em>I am of opinion that
                            the judge might in certain circumstances come to the conclusion that
                            disclosure of a particular risk was so obviously necessary to an
                            informed choice on the part of the patient that no reasonably prudent
                            medical man would fail to make it</em>. The kind of case I have in
                        mind would be an operation involving a substantial risk of grave adverse
                        consequences, as, for example, the ten per cent. risk of a stroke from the
                        operation which was the subject of the Canadian case of Reibl v. Hughes,
                        114 D.L.R. (3d) 1. <em>In such a case, in the
                            absence of some cogent clinical reason why the patient should not be
                            informed, a doctor, recognising and respecting his patient's right of
                            decision, could hardly fail to appreciate the necessity for an
                            appropriate warning</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Lord Bridge went on to find for the defendant, accepting the evidence
                    of the medical experts.</p>

                    trite law that before a doctor performs procedures on a patient, the patient
                    should be advised on his medical condition, alternative treatment options, the
                    nature of the treatment options and the respective benefits, risks and possible

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    It is pertinent to make three preliminary
                    points. First, as noted, it was not disputed that MS signed a consent form on
                    11 March 2007, prior to the redo-CABG. However, the mere signing of a form
                    in itself did not show that Dr Tong had not breached his duty to advise
                    MS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Second, there is generally no requirement
                    for doctors to explain risks which an average person is ordinarily aware of or
                    which the particular patient has knowledge of (“pre-existing
                    knowledge”). (See the Saskatchewan first instance decision of <em>Haughian v Paine</em> 1986 CarswellSask 184, overruled but
                    not on this point.) Once the patient understands certain information, there may
                    be no further need for the doctor to provide the self-same information.
                    Therefore, the standard of advice which the doctor should provide to his patient
                    differs according to the pre-existing knowledge of the patient. However,
                    Dr Tong would have breached his duty if he had not given MS any advice on
                    the nature of a redo-CABG, its risks and alternatives but assumed that MS had
                    this information simply because he had recently undergone the initial CABG. In
                    cross-examination, the plaintiff accepted that it was a fair assumption that
                    Dr Tong did take steps to ascertain with MS that MS understood the risks
                    and complications of a CABG:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">However, while a redo-CABG and the initial CABG follow the same
                    procedure, the risks of a redo-CABG are higher and this is not disputed by
                    Dr Tong. The plaintiff claims that Dr Tong had a duty to advise MS on
                    the higher mortality and morbidity risks of the redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The third issue also pertains to the
                    pre-existing knowledge of the patient, in a situation where a patient is
                    attended to by a team of medical personnel. Once a member of the team advises
                    the patient of certain information and the patient understands such information,
                    the patient can be said to have pre-existing knowledge of such information with
                    the effect that the other members of the team need not repeat the same
                    information to the patient. In the instant case, Dr Tong was one of a team
                    of doctors attending to MS (“the Medical Team”). Dr Tong
                    testified that when he received a referral from a cardiologist,
                    Dr Christopher Chew in this case, he would work as a team with the
                        cardiologist.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The Medical Team comprised Dr Tong, a
                    cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Christopher Chew, a cardiologist and
                    Dr Suelyn Chew, an anaesthetist. The defence noted that there were at least
                    12 instances of communication between MS and the Medical Team, six of which were
                    with Dr Tong and Dr Christopher Chew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The defence went on to contend that MS had
                    ample opportunity to ask his doctors for more information if he felt that such
                    information was needed. While accepting that MS could indeed have requested more
                    information, I must reiterate that the onus remains on the doctor to provide
                    advice, regardless of whether the patient asks any questions. The onus is not,
                    and cannot be, on the patient to obtain information by asking questions. The
                    reason for this is self-evident: a patient who does not know what information he
                    does not know will not be able to ask for such information. To require otherwise
                    would be to put the patient in an impossible position. Guideline 4.22 of the
                    Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”) Ethical Code and Ethical
                    Guidelines affirms that this is the position in Singapore:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is a doctor’s responsibility to ensure that a
                            patient under his care is adequately informed</em> about his
                        medical condition and options for treatment so that he is able to
                        participate in decisions about his treatment. If a procedure needs to be
                        performed, <em>the patient shall be made aware</em> of
                        the benefits, risks and possible complications of the procedure and any
                        alternatives available to him...</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    While the SMC Guidelines do not impose civil
                    liability on the doctors, they provide evidence as to the position taken by a

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 2a: Whether Dr Tong’s failure to advised MS of
                the mortality risks in percentage terms amounted to a breach of duty</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A preliminary issue: prejudice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Dr Tong’s pleaded case was that
                    he had informed MS that the mortality risk of a redo-CABG was about 3%. Further,
                    Dr Tong claimed that it was “reasonable to advise of a 3% mortality
                    risk on the basis of [his] knowledge and experience”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>
                    Moreover, there was contemporaneous written evidence that MS had been advised of
                    the 3% risk, <em>viz</em>, the Clinician’s Notes,
                    where Dr Tong recorded that the “usual OP risk of 3% for redo CABG +
                    small risk of stroke [was] discussed”. Therefore, the plaintiff’s
                    and defendant’s experts prepared their reports on the basis that the
                    figure of 3% was conveyed to MS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    However, during cross-examination,
                    Dr Tong stated that he had in fact <em>not</em>
                    related the specific percentage figure to MS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> His
                    explanation for the record in the Clinician’s Notes was that the figure of
                    3% was his estimated risk, which he had recorded for his own purposes.
                    Dr Tong’s case during trial was that he informed MS that the risks of
                    the redo-CABG were “significantly several times more, higher than
                    first-time operation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The plaintiff’s position is that this
                    statement during the hearing was one that was made “to everyone’s
                    surprise”. The plaintiff argues that Dr Tong’s new position at
                    trial, <em>viz</em>, that what was communicated to MS was
                        <em>not</em> 3% mortality risk but that the redo-CABG
                    was many times riskier than primary CABG - is a distinct and new case. Thus,
                    according to the plaintiff, Dr Tong should not be allowed to depart from
                    his pleaded case that a 3% mortality risk had been communicated, as this would
                    cause her to be unfairly prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Prior to the defendant’s evidence in
                    court that he had not communicated the 3% figure to MS, the issue of mortality
                    risks had been framed as a question of whether the <em>quantum</em> of 3% was a reasonable one. Following the revelation
                    that no specific percentage had been communicated to MS at all, the
                    plaintiff’s argument turned to Dr Tong’s duty to advise MS
                    which would require him to quantify for MS the redo-CABG’s mortality risks
                    in percentage terms. The plaintiff’s experts were questioned on the basis
                    that the 3% risk had been communicated. The issue of whether it was reasonable
                    for the doctor to communicate a specific percentage figure at all had not been
                    raised and the plaintiff’s experts thus had no opportunity to give their
                    opinions on the matter. The plaintiff stated that had she been informed of
                    Dr Tong’s change in position earlier, she would have asked her
                    experts to file supplementary affidavits on this specific point and her
                    preparation of the case would have been different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The plaintiff further asserted that this
                    change in position called into question the veracity of the medical notes and
                    Dr Tong’s credibility. On the face of it, the wording recorded in the
                    Clinician’s Notes seems to suggest that MS was advised specifically of the
                    3% risk and the statement that no such advice was given deviates from the
                    contemporaneous evidence. The fact that the contemporaneous evidence was not an
                    accurate record on this one point might leave doubts as to its evidential
                    value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The plaintiff also argued that Dr Tong
                    had asserted the positive case that he had informed and reasonably advised the
                    late MS that the risk of mortality was 3%. Therefore, the burden was on
                    Dr Tong to prove his positive case and he had clearly failed to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In response, the defence countered that
                    there were no grounds for the plaintiff to argue that Dr Tong had changed
                    his position. Dr Tong’s case was framed in terms of advising MS of
                    the higher risks of a redo-CABG as opposed to an initial CABG, rather than
                    giving MS the figure of a 3% mortality risk. While I accept that
                    Dr Tong’s pleaded case was that he informed MS of the higher risks of
                    a redo-CABG, paragraph 11 of the defence clearly states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Tong warned MS (Milakov) that the mortality risk of a redo-CABG
                        was about 3% (higher than initial CABG), and that there was also a small
                        risk of stroke...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, at paragraph 25(2) of the defence, Dr Tong
                    averred:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) ... Dr Tong further avers it was reasonable to advise of a 3%
                        mortality risk on the basis of Dr Tong’s knowledge and
                        experience;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It can be seen clearly that Dr Tong’s pleaded case was that
                    he warned MS that the risk of the redo-CABG was higher <em>and</em> that he had warned MS of the 3% mortality risk in a
                    redo-CABG. It is thus unsurprising that preparations for trial proceeded on the
                    common ground that the figure of 3% was conveyed to MS. This was the view of the
                    plaintiff and it was shared by the experts on both sides.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Even so, I respectfully disagree that the
                    plaintiff would be unfairly prejudiced. I begin by observing, as Dr Tong
                    rightly pointed out to me, that it was the plaintiff who first raised the 3%
                    figure in her statement of claim (“SOC”). Paragraph 21 of the SOC
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    Milakov Steven and the Plaintiff were led to belief
                                [<em>sic</em>] by Dr Tong that re-do
                            coronary artery surgery did not carry with it any special risks.
                                <em>The only information they received form
                                Dr Tong was that there was a 3% risk of the surgery not being
                                successful</em>. Neither were Milakov Steven or the Plaintiff
                            aware of serious complications and/or risks associated ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 3% figure appeared again under the particulars of breach at
                    paragraph 29(b) (for negligence) and paragraph 32(b) (under contract). Paragraph
                    29(b) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b. He breached his duty of care when he misinformed Milakov Steven that
                        the re-do coronary surgery that he recommended only carried a very small
                        operative risk of 3% of the surgery not being successful. This information
                        was not only wrong but was wholly inadequate;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The corresponding paragraph 32(b) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b. He breached the agreement when he misinformed Milakov Steven that the
                        re-do coronary surgery that he recommended only carried a very small

                        was not only wrong but was wholly inadequate;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The 3% figure was also found in the
                    plaintiff’s affidavit. At trial, the figure was even read from the
                    affidavit to Dr Tong, who did not object to it.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    When Dr Tong stated at trial that he
                    had not communicated the 3% figure to MS, counsel for the plaintiff did not
                    contest this. It is also clear from the plaintiff’s written submissions
                    that the plaintiff accepts that the 3% figure was not communicated to MS. How
                    then did the specific figure of 3% manage to find its way into the SOC and the
                    plaintiff’s affidavit? I found this to be quite puzzling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    In addition, just as Dr Tong’s
                    change of position might be a reason to doubt the evidential value of the
                    contemporaneous medical notes in proving what transpired between MS and the
                    doctors, the plaintiff’s change of position might be a reason to doubt the
                    credibility of her claims. If the plaintiff did come to know of the 3% figure
                    from Dr Tong, it would not do for her to say that she did not know of the
                    percentage figure simply because Dr Tong said he never communicated
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I add also that I believe the
                    plaintiff’s submission that Dr Tong carries the burden to prove the
                    positive case which he asserted is misguided. If the SOC did not mention the 3%
                    figure and simply accused Dr Tong not advising MS of the redo-CABG’s
                    mortality risks, then Dr Tong would be asserting a positive case if he
                    denied that he did not advise regarding the mortality risks on the basis that he
                    communicated the 3% risk figure. In that situation, I would hold that
                    Dr Tong had the burden to prove that he did in fact communicate the 3%
                    figure. However, the plaintiff’s claim included both the accusation that
                    Dr Tong had not advised MS adequately regarding the mortality risks
                        <em>and</em> the accusation that the 3% figure which he
                    did advise on was a negligent underestimation. In these circumstances, the
                    defence to the plaintiff’s claim was not exactly the assertion of a
                    positive case since it may be understood as simply accepting the
                    plaintiff’s initial averment that the 3% risk figure was
                    communicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Even so, since Dr Tong’s position
                    was that he never communicated the 3% figure to MS, he should not have accepted
                    that he did so in the defence. It is also true that in the circumstances, the
                    plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to adduce evidence through her expert
                    witnesses regarding the issue whether Dr Tong breached his duty to advise
                    MS regarding the redo-CABG by not quantifying the risk for MS in percentage
                    terms. However, while it would have been more helpful to have had more evidence
                    presented on this specific point, I find that there is sufficient evidence
                    before me on which I can base my decision. Although the plaintiff’s
                    experts did not have the chance to testify on this specific issue, the
                    defence’s experts did give convincing views which I will elaborate on when
                    I move to consider the issue proper below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The <em>Bolam</em> test
                    simply requires that Dr Tong’s practice relating to advice be
                    affirmed by a body of responsible medical men skilled in his particular art. I
                    will go on to demonstrate below that the evidence of Dr Tong’s
                    experts was satisfactorily affirmatory in that respect. I am also confident that
                    any evidence which the plaintiff’s experts might have provided, short of
                    proving that Dr Tong’s experts did not constitute a body of
                    responsible medical men skilled in Dr Tong’s art, would not change my
                    finding in that regard. Therefore, I find that although the misleading nature of
                    Dr Tong’s averments up to the trial should be frowned upon, it did
                    not prejudice the plaintiff in the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    For the record, I accept
                    Dr Tong’s testimony that he did not communicate the 3% risk figure to
                    MS and that he had instead simply told MS that the risk of his redo-CABG would
                    be “significantly several times more” than the initial CABG. I
                    considered whether Dr Tong’s change of position at trial might have
                    been an expedient tactic due to his realisation after the plaintiff’s
                    experts gave their evidence that 3% was an indefensible underestimation of the
                    redo-CABG’s risk. However, Dr Tong did not abandon his position that
                    the 3% figure was reasonable. He stated that the 3% figure was what was on his
                    notes and in his mind when he communicated to MS that the risk of the redo-CABG
                    was “significantly several times more” than the initial CABG.
                    Since MS was dead, Dr Tong was the only person who could give evidence
                    regarding exactly what he said to MS and I saw no advantage to be gained by
                    deceit on his part, I therefore accept his evidence on this. It remains for me
                    to add that, in any event, I found that Dr Tong’s 3% risk estimate
                    was not negligently made (see paragraphs <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above). As for how the plaintiff
                    obtained the 3% figure for her claim, in the absence of a forthright explanation
                    from the plaintiff, I can only conjecture that she had sight of some medical
                    report or other in the aftermath of MS’s demise which mentioned the
                    figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Dr Tong’s failure to inform MS of the exact
                percentage figure of the risk amounted to a breach of duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Moving on to the issue proper,
                    Dr Tong’s evidence at trial made it clear that he did not inform MS
                    of the percentage figure of risk, and the plaintiff argued that this amounted to
                    a breach of Dr Tong’s duty to advise. First, the plaintiff argued
                    that the standard practice in Singapore was to convey specific percentage
                    figures of risks. In support, the plaintiff contended that if the issue of
                    quantum was not important, Dr Tong would not have stated that he had
                    informed MS of the 3% risk in his affidavit and that this figure was reasonable.
                    This was characterised by the plaintiff as an admission that such communication
                    ought to have been part of the scope of reasonable advice that was communicated
                    to MS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Further, the plaintiff noted that all the
                    expert cardiothoracic surgeons who had given evidence during the hearing
                    referred to various risks models which highlighted in percentage terms the risk
                    of mortality and serious morbidity. The experts derived these figures from two
                    international scoring systems, namely the EuroSCORE and STS. As noted earlier,
                    these are well-recognised systems which are used, among other things, to provide
                    a specific quantum of mortality risks. While the experts had disagreed on the
                        <em>quantum</em> of the risk, they had all used
                    percentage figures in their expert opinions. The plaintiff argued that if there
                    was no established practice of providing an estimate of mortality risks in
                    percentage terms, the experts would not have taken so much effort to address
                    this issue in their respective expert opinions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    However, in my view, the extensive
                    discussion of the 3% figure was a function of how the plaintiff’s claim
                    was framed in the first place. Dr Tong’s pleadings which in all
                    appearances affirmed that he communicated the 3% figure to the plaintiff
                    contributed to the eventual melee at the centre of which was the issue of what
                    the redo-CABG’s risks should have been reasonably quantified as. That
                    issue naturally led the experts to focus their discussions on percentages and
                    risk scores. Having said that, I would accept that the doctors are familiar with
                    how one can responsibly conceptualise risks in terms of percentages and that
                    they have a standard practice of <em>considering</em> the
                    risks in terms of percentage figures. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily
                    mean that the doctors have a standard practice of <em>communicating</em> these percentage figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Ultimately, as I stated earlier, I found the
                    expert evidence adduced by Dr Tong on this issue to be decisive. Prof
                    Buxton stated in his written expert opinion (exhibited to his affidavit) the
                    following (at paragraph 2.18) which I found extremely pertinent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.18 In MS’s case, he had been informed of an estimated mortality
                        risk of 3% in redo-CABGs. A 3% mortality risk is a significant risk of death
                        which MS appeared to understand. It is also higher than the mortality risk
                        of a first CABG. <em>In practice, many surgeons will not
                            inform patients of the exact percentage or risk, and simply inform the
                            patients that a redo-CABG comes with significant risk of death, higher
                            than in a first CABG. Either case is acceptable</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    I note in particular this written opinion
                    was tendered before the trial <em>ie</em> before
                    Dr Tong stated that he did not actually communicate a specific percentage
                    to MS. Prof Buxton went on to testify that in practice, many surgeons would
                        <em>not</em> inform patients of the exact percentage of
                    risk and would simply inform patients that a redo-CABG involved a significant
                    risk of death, higher than that in an initial CABG.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    I also had regard to Dr Sin’s
                    expert report (exhibited to his affidavit which was also tendered before the
                    trial) which stated at paragraph 43:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    It should be noted that a 3% risk of mortality,
                            which means death during the surgery itself or in the immediate 30
                            post-operative days, <em>is a significant risk especially
                                when it is highlighted as higher than in initial CABG which by
                                itself is already a major procedure</em>. In my experience, a
                            patient who has been warned of death, especially a significant 3% risk
                            of death, would be well equipped to understand the high risk of the
                            surgery which he is undergoing and to choose whether to undergo the
                            surgery or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notwithstanding the second sentence of the said paragraph 43, the
                    first sentence clearly implies that the significance of the risk is brought out
                    not merely by the 3% figure but <em>especially</em> more so
                    when it is highlighted as higher than an initial CABG. This provides convincing
                    support for Dr Tong’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The plaintiff also argued that Prof Buxton
                    was not familiar with local practice in Singapore and observed that Dr Sin,
                    who practises in Singapore, believed that it was an established practice in
                    Singapore to provide advice to patients awaiting a redo-CABG in terms of
                    percentages of mortality (see <a href="#p1_154">[154]</a> below).
                    However, Dr Sin also testified regarding the difficulties in giving
                    specific risk percentages and opined that to do so without a relative indication
                    might not be helpful:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now, it's a problem whenever I talk to patients, because on some years we
                        actually have zero mortalities in low risk CABGs, and unfortunately I cannot
                        tell patients that, “Your mortality is zero.” It is a major
                        operation. It is a risky operation. All open heart surgeries are risky, much
                        as my patients would like to hear me say, “There is no risk.”
                        ... So when you look at what is high risk, a lot of times we have to give a
                        relative number to help. Some patients like a hard figure, but you would
                        still like to have a benchmark, so in the case of a patient where I say,
                        “Well, our usual risk is 2 to 3 per cent, and in your case your risk
                        is ‘usual’,” then the patient understands that yes, there
                        is a risk, but my risk is usual. On the other hand, if I were to tell a
                        patient that your risk is 30 per cent, he has no reference – is this
                        high or is this low?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    When I pursued this matter with Dr Sin,

<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, while the plaintiff was right to note that Dr Sin did
                    say that doctors should convey risks in terms of percentages, this was not an
                    entirely accurate portrayal of Dr Sin’s opinion. Dr Sin had
                    repeatedly emphasised that it was more important to convey the risks in relative
                    terms, rather than in absolute percentage figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    In particular, Dr Sin also highlighted

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    I agree with Dr Sin that it is more
                    important to convey the risks in terms of relativity rather than in terms of an
                    absolute percentage figure. As seen above, risk figures are merely estimates and
                    may legitimately differ to some extent. The percentages can vary widely
                    depending on whether the EuroSCORE or the STS system is used, <em>viz</em> 14.34% and 2.3% respectively in this case. In particular,
                    Dr Sin alluded to the disparity between the two systems:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I can give that patient a EuroSCORE and he may freak out because it's so
                        high, or I can give him an STS and he may not freak out because it's so
                        low.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I note that the reluctance of expert medical witnesses to measure
                    risks in percentage terms is not unique to the experts that were before me, as
                    Lord Bridge had observed in <em>Sidaway</em> (at 900
                    – 901) that “some of the expert medical witnesses called expressed
                    a marked and understandable reluctance” to “measure such risks in
                    percentage terms”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    I will now address the plaintiff’s
                    second argument, <em>viz</em>, that percentage terms would
                    provide the patient with an easy reference to understand the risks of mortality.
                    It would be easy for a reasonably intelligent person to appreciate that a 3%
                    risk meant that three out of 100 patients would not survive the surgery. Even if
                    there is no general legal requirement for doctors to provide risk estimates in
                    percentage terms, this does not rule out the possibility that in some cases, the
                    failure to discuss risks in percentage terms might amount to a breach of duty.
                    In the instant case, it is uncontroversial that MS would have understood the
                    implications of the percentage figure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    While Dr Sin acknowledged as much and
                    stated that “if the patient is fully equipped to understand a
                    percentage”, then it ought to be conveyed, there was nothing to suggest
                    that the positions of Prof Buxton and Dr Sin set out in their reports (in
                    the quotations above) stating there was no need to communicate a specific risk
                    percentage did not apply to patients who could understand the concept of a
                    percentage risk figure. Indeed, thanks to the spread of numerical literacy in
                    today’s Australian and Singaporean societies in which Prof Buxton and
                    Dr Sin practise, it is likely that the majority of patients would
                    understand a risk percentage figure presented to them. Therefore, while it might
                    be good medical practice to convey risks both in terms of relativity <em>and</em> in percentage figures, I find that there is a
                    responsible body of medical opinion which supports Dr Tong’s decision
                    to convey the risks to MS only in relative terms, without a percentage
                    figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Therefore, taking all the evidence into
                    consideration, I find that Dr Tong’s duty to advise MS did not behove
                    him to present MS with a specific risk percentage. I found that by making clear
                    to MS that the redo-CABG presented him with a risk that was
                    “significantly several times more” than the initial CABG, MS was
                    adequately impressed with the gravity of the decision he was being asked to make
                    and the significance of the risk he was undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 2b: Whether Dr Tong informed MS about the risks of
                mortality associated with the redo-CABG </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    It is clear that the mortality risks
                    associated with a redo-CABG are higher than those of an initial CABG. In the
                    instant case, in addition to being riskier than an initial CABG, the particular
                    redo-CABG that MS was to undergo was also riskier than a ‘normal’
                    redo-CABG for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff asserts that Dr Tong ought to have specifically
                    advised MS of the two proximities in time. This assertion will be dealt with
                    later in the judgment. I will first examine the general issue of whether the
                    risk of mortality associated with a redo-CABG was discussed at all, before
                    moving to the specific issues on the increased risks of the particular CABG that
                    MS was to undergo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    There is a factual dispute on whether the
                    mortality risks were disclosed. It is important to observe that it is not the
                    plaintiff’s case that Dr Tong had to advise MS that the mortality
                    risks in a redo-CABG were <em>higher</em> than that of an
                    initial CABG. The plaintiff’s case is that the risk of mortality in a
                    redo-CABG was a significant risk and that Dr Tong did not disclose this
                    risk to MS; she does not argue that the relativity of the risks between a
                    redo-CABG and an initial CABG need to be specifically highlighted. It was
                    Dr Tong who brought up the point on relativity, as he asserted that he had
                    advised MS that the risks of mortality and complications in a redo-CABG were
                    several times higher than those of an initial CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The onus is on the plaintiff to demonstrate,
                    on a balance of probabilities, that the risks of mortality associated with a
                    redo-CABG were not disclosed and not on Dr Tong to show that he had advised
                    MS that the risks of mortality in a redo-CABG were higher than that of an
                    initial CABG. The plaintiff argues that “[i]f Dr Tong did not warn
                    the late Milakov about the risk of mortality as pleaded in the Defence, one
                    would have to fall back on the case of the Plaintiff that Dr Tong did not
                    advise Milakov about the risk of mortality at all”. I respectfully
                    disagree with the plaintiff on this point. It is incorrect to state that there
                    are only two possible factual scenarios, namely, that MS was advised of a 3%
                    mortality risk or that MS received no advice on the risk of mortality at all.
                    The evidence will be examined to determine what advice, if any, was given to MS
                    on the increased mortality risks of the redo-CABG as compared to his initial
                    CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I will first examine the contemporaneous
                    evidence. There are two main sources of contemporaneous written evidence. The
                    Clinician’s Notes (a joint record compiled by the members of the Medical
                    Team) and the Clinical Summary furnished by M. C. Tong Cardiothoracic Surgery
                    Centre (“the Clinical Summary”) and Dr Tong’s personal
                    notes. As stated earlier, Dr Tong made an entry in the Clinician’s
                    Notes on 9 March 2007 at 12.00 noon that the “usual OP risk of 3%
                    for redo CABG + small risk of stroke discussed”, though Dr Tong
                    subsequently conceded that the figure of 3% was never conveyed to MS. In the
                    Clinical Summary, Dr Tong recorded that the “usual op risk of stroke
                    and bleeding in redo-op is higher”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    It must be noted that on the face of it, the
                    record did not say that this risk was <em>communicated</em>
                    to MS. The plaintiff also pointed out that Dr Tong’s Clinical Summary
                    made no reference to mortality risks but only referred to stroke and bleeding.
                    Therefore, the contemporaneous medical notes appear to support the
                    plaintiff’s case that there was no disclosure of mortality
                risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    I will now turn to the recollection of the
                    parties as to what advice was given during the consultations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Tong’s consultation with MS on 9 March 2007 at
                12.00 noon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Dr Tong stated that during this
                    consultation, he had “emphasised to MS that a redo CABG had a much higher
                    risk of mortality and other possible complications. [He] informed MS that the
                    mortality risk was higher than the first CABG...”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Dr Tong also
                    asserted that he was aware of MS’s “history of borderline diabetes
                    mellitus and hypertension, [and] advised him that these conditions, if not under
                    medical control, [might] put him at greater risks compared with a patient who
                    did not have these conditions”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Christopher Chew’s consultation with MS on 9 March
                2007 at 12.55pm</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    This review took place shortly after
                    MS’s discussion with Dr Tong. Dr Christopher Chew stated that
                    while he could not recollect exactly what was said at each discussion, at this
                    particular consultation, MS explained to him that Dr Tong had recommended a
                    redo-CABG. Dr Christopher Chew opined that “MS was well aware that
                    there was a serious risk that he could die from the redo-CABG itself, and that
                    there were risks of complications”. Further, Dr Chew asserted that
                    he affirmed his agreement with Dr Tong’s assessment of the risks
                    involved in the redo-CABG.</p>

                    “reiterated that there was a higher risk of mortality ... in a redo-CABG

                    Dr Christopher Chew made no reference to <em>mortality</em> risks specifically.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The plaintiff acknowledges that she does not
                    have the evidence of MS to counter what Dr Tong claimed he had communicated
                    to MS. However, she asserts that based on the contemporaneous evidence, there is
                    nothing to suggest that the issue of mortality was discussed with MS. Further,
                    she notes that Dr Christopher Chew had conceded that he was not able to
                    recollect the communications between MS and himself. He also did not claim to
                    know the specific issues relating to mortality in a redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Counsel for the plaintiff also asserted that
                    even though MS met with the Medical Team on 12 occasions, this fact was neither
                    important nor relevant, as the only person who could have communicated the risk
                    of mortality associated with the redo-CABG surgery was the cardiothoracic
                    surgeon on the Medical Team, <em>ie</em> Dr Tong. I
                    respectfully disagree with counsel for the plaintiff on this issue. To state
                    that only Dr Tong could give advice on the risks of the surgery ignores the
                    reality of how a Medical Team works in practice. It would also lead to unwanted
                    repercussions, where each doctor has to run through all the risks of a
                    procedure, leading to inefficiencies and an ultimately reduced quality of
                    care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Finding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    As stated above, I accepted
                    Dr Tong’s evidence that he warned MS that the risks for a redo-CABG
                    would be “significantly several times more” than those for an
                    initial CABG. It is uncontroversial that MS met several doctors separately on
                    several occasions. I recall the following passage from <em>Gunapathy</em> at [131]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">131    Accordingly, we found that the judge had
                            manifestly erred in his findings relating to the advice rendered by the
                            doctors. Given the incoherence of Gunapathy's testimony, there was no
                            justification in refuting the consistent testimony of the three doctors
                            who gave clear evidence that she had been informed of the relevant
                            risks. <em>Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that
                                Gunapathy was an educated person, with the presence of mind to seek
                                confirmation by obtaining a second opinion. She had also been
                                suffering under the spectre of brain cancer for more than a year. It
                                seemed most unlikely that she would have allowed herself to be
                                brushed aside with half-baked advice that radiosurgery was "simple"
                                without more</em>. In the totality of evidence, we accepted
                            the account given by the doctors that they had properly informed her of
                            the risks inherent in radiosurgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Of course, MS did not seek a second opinion
                    in this case but he and the plaintiff were clearly educated persons and I find
                    it hard to believe that they did not discuss the possibility of death with any
                    of the doctors during any of those consultations. Even if they did not, I also
                    find it difficult to believe that MS did not appreciate that the CABG surgery in
                    Houston carried with it the risk of death. The CABG is open heart surgery which
                    involves sawing through the sternum and interfering directly with the heart.
                    Surely, MS must have appreciated that the operation might not go well and that
                    he faced a significant risk of dying. Having found that MS was told that he
                    faced a risk that was “significantly several times more” in
                    respect of the redo-CABG, I have no trouble holding that he was adequately
                    advised of the significant mortality risk which he faced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 2c: Whether Dr Tong informed MS of the risk of all the
                serious morbidities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    It is uncontroverted that Dr Tong
                    warned MS of the risk of bleeding, a small risk of a stroke and the possibility
                    of the re-occlusion of the grafts. That such risks were discussed appears
                    clearly from the contemporaneous evidence. Dr Suelyn Chew, an anaesthetist,
                    also documented her advice on the higher risks of bleeding perioperatively in
                    the Clinician’s Notes. However, the plaintiff asserts Dr Tong failed
                    to warn MS of the possibility of serious infection, renal failure, liver
                    failure, heart malfunction and multi organ failure and she claims that this
                    amounted to a breach of Dr Tong’s duty to advise MS. Dr Tong
                    does not dispute that he did not, in fact, warn MS of the possibility of renal
                    failure, liver failure, heart malfunction and multi organ failure. Dr Tong
                    further stated on cross-examination that he only saw it necessary to advise MS
                    on the primary and major complications:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Nevertheless, the question is: does the
                    doctor have a duty to warn the patient of all the major morbidities
                    specifically? The defence argues that even though Dr Tong did not advise MS
                    of <em>all</em> the serious morbidities, this did not
                    amount to a breach of his duty. The experts called by the defence opined that it
                    accorded with accepted practice not to list all the morbidities. Dr Sin
                    agreed that the risks of major morbidities should be conveyed to the patients
                    but that what ought to be conveyed was the “big headings” of
                    risks. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> In
                    his opinion, providing a comprehensive list of morbidities and their percentages
                    would serve to confuse patients and might give a “false sense of
                        risk”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The defence relied on <em>Sidaway</em>, where Lord Bridge opined on the duty to advice:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are, it appears to me, at least theoretically, two extreme positions
                        which could be taken. It could be argued that, if the patient's consent is
                        to be fully informed, <em>the doctor must specifically warn
                            him of</em> all <em>risks
                            involved</em> in the treatment offered, unless he has some sound
                        clinical reason not to do so. Logically, this would seem to be the extreme
                        to which a truly objective criterion of the doctor's duty would lead.
                            <em>Yet this position finds no support from any
                            authority, to which we have been referred, in any
                            jurisdiction</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defence thus argued that there is no requirement that all
                    mortalities and morbidities must be advised and that a doctor is entitled to
                    exercise clinical judgment in deciding the degree of disclosure of risks to
                    convey, bearing in mind the objective of assisting the particular patient to
                    make a rational choice as to whether or not to undergo the treatment in
                    question. I accept this argument, as it accords with the clear position under
                    Singapore law that <em>Bolam</em> applies to the duty to
                    advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    In this regard, I also considered the
                    following passage from <em>Gunapathy</em> at [132]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two defence experts agreed that what the doctors had disclosed in their
                        advice to Gunapathy was sufficient in the present case. <em>We did not find this opinion to be illogical, for, as explained by Prof
                            Karlsson, the rationale should merely be that the patient understood the
                            main risks of the operation</em>. Accordingly, on an application
                        of the <em>Bolam</em> test to the issue of
                        advice, the defendant doctors would not be liable in negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I find that MS was aware that the redo-CABG might result in death
                    and/or complications which would lead to morbidities, a few of which were
                    specifically mentioned to him. Accordingly, I find that MS understood the main
                    risks of the operation and Dr Tong did not fail to advise MS properly on
                    the redo-CABG in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 2d: Whether Dr Tong was required to specifically
                inform MS of the increased risks due to the two proximities in time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    With regard to the first proximity in time,
                    as explained above, after the initial CABG, there would be scarring of the
                    tissues in the chest and these tissues would be highly vascularised. A redo-CABG
                    would thus involve heavier blood loss than an initial CABG. The freeing of the
                    vascular adhesions between the heart and the breast bone and the pericardium and
                    the heart during the redo-CABG would have resulted in a high degree of bleeding
                    in MS’s case, given that he had undergone the initial CABG only about 7
                    weeks prior to the redo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    It must be noted that it was the
                    plaintiff’s case that the redo-CABG had taken place within six weeks from
                    the initial CABG but this appeared to be a calculation error. Nonetheless,
                    nothing material turns on the discrepancy. The plaintiff emphasised that the
                    proximity in time between a redo-CABG and an initial CABG was not a usual
                    feature of a redo-CABG but was both very uncommon and very risky and thus needed
                    to be specifically highlighted to MS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    With regard to the second proximity in time,
                    Dr Sharma testified that operating after a patient had an AMI was an
                    extremely risky proposition as it would involve stopping the patient’s
                    heart after part of it had died and asking it to restart again.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> Prof Buxton
                    agreed that the two proximities would enhance and increase the risk of mortality
                    and major morbidities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    The plaintiff claims that Dr Tong
                    breached his duty to obtain informed consent as he failed to inform MS of the
                    particular issue of the two proximities in time. She further claims that the two
                    proximities “compounded each other and had a cumulative effect in
                    connection with elevating the risk factor in relation to mortality and major
                    morbidity”. This appeared to be acknowledged by Prof Buxton who opined
                    that the risks of the particular surgery MS was to undergo would probably be at
                    the “higher end of the range of risk modelling results”, as it was
                    uncommon to find a patient who has had “two bypass procedures within two
                    months or six weeks and, secondly, has had an [AMI] prior to the
                        [redo-CABG]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    I noted that the cases which the plaintiff
                    cites in support of her claims, indeed, most of the landmark cases in this area
                    of law, involve doctors being sued for the failure to warn of unlikely negative
                    outcomes which ultimately occurred. In <em>Bolam</em>, the
                    plaintiff underwent electroconvulsive therapy but was not warned that he might
                    suffer a fracture, which he did. In <em>Sidaway</em>, the
                    plaintiff underwent an operation to treat recurrent pain in her neck, right
                    shoulder and arms. She was not warned of a risk of between 1 – 2 % that
                    her spinal column might be damaged. The damage occurred and she became severely
                    disabled. In <em>Rogers</em>, the plaintiff had lived
                    almost forty years being almost totally blind in her right eye. She was not
                    warned that surgery to help her injured right eye might affect her good left
                    eye. This was despite the fact that she asked specifically whether her good eye
                    might be affected. Tragically, the surgery caused her to develop a condition
                    which led to the complete loss of sight in her left eye. In <em>Pearce</em>, the plaintiff who was fourteen days beyond her pregnancy
                    term was advised by her doctor that medical intervention as not appropriate
                    given the risks. However, she was not warned by her doctor that this would
                    increase the risk of a stillbirth by 0.1 – 0.2 %. Unfortunately, the
                    untoward event happened and the plaintiff sued. It must be noted that in all
                    these cases, the patient sued the doctor for the failure to warn of specific
                    morbidities that eventually occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Turning to the present case, I have found
                    above that that MS was adequately advised on the risk of mortality and
                    morbidities. The plaintiff’s complaint here is that MS was unaware that
                    the two proximities would <em>increase</em> the mortality
                    and morbidity risks of the redo-CABG and that he should have been advised of
                    that. I have held that MS was warned that the risks of death and morbidities
                    would be “significantly several times higher”. I should think
                    that, having been advised of the increased risks, the omission to advise
                    specifically of <em>why</em> the risks would be increased
                    was reasonable and did not amount to a breach of the duty to advise. Therefore,
                    I find that Dr Tong’s failure to warn MS specifically of the increase
                    in risks <em>due to</em> the two proximities was not
                    negligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 2e: Whether Dr Tong informed MS of the option to
                postpone the redo-CABG on account of MS’s improving condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    The plaintiff claims that the option to
                    postpone was never given to MS and that the first time Dr Tong mentioned
                    the option was while he was preparing the defence. The plaintiff argues that MS
                    was never advised of the significance of his improving condition, <em>ie</em>, that this improvement provided him with an
                    opportunity to delay the redo-CABG, instead of going ahead on the scheduled date
                    of 12 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    However, in the plaintiff’s reply to
                    Dr Tong’s written submission, the plaintiff appears to concede that
                    there was a discussion between MS and Dr Tong on the option to postpone the
                    surgery:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The discussion on the 10 March 2007 to postpone the surgery was
                        merely an exercise Dr Tong embarked in wanting to confirm that
                        Milakov’s decision to proceed with the surgery as the Plaintiff had
                        informed him the day before that Milakov was still unsure about going ahead
                        with the surgery. The medical and clinical notes as well as the medical
                        reports prepared by Dr Tong do not support his contention that he
                        offered to delay the surgery <u>because Milakov’s
                            health was improving</u>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis original]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    This seems to be a shift from the
                    plaintiff’s earlier position that the first time Dr Tong raised the
                    issue about an opportunity to delay the surgery was when he prepared his defence
                    to the case and that he had never given MS this discussion to postpone. As I
                    understand it, the re-characterisation of the issue is that Dr Tong did
                    offer the option to postpone the surgery but did not tell MS about the
                    improvement in his health. The plaintiff claims that “what is important
                    is not so much the discussion on postponement of RedoCABG but whether
                    Dr Tong informed the late Milakov that his improving health required him to
                    revisit the decision of RedoCABG Surgery on 12 March 2007” and that
                    the “offer to postponing [<em>sic</em>] the surgery
                    is one thing but providing the reason why the surgery can be safely postponed is
                    quite another”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    However, in the contemporaneous
                    Clinician’s Notes, Dr Tong recorded an entry on 10 March 2007
                    stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Have another talk with patients options of either to postpone or go ahead
                        with the redo CABG on Monday [12 March 2007] discussed thoroughly. He
                        decided to be operated on Monday. Feeling better today...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    While this does not state that the option to
                    postpone was offered to MS <em>because of his improving
                        condition</em>, it is clear that Dr Tong was aware that
                    MS’s condition had improved. Dr Tong affirmed in his AEIC that
                    MS’s improved condition had a causal effect on the provision of the option
                    to postpone:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In light of the improvement in his condition, I explained to MS that he
                        could postpone the redo-CABG or proceed as scheduled on 12 March 2007.
                        We had a thorough discussion about both options. I explained that he could
                        consider postponement of the redo-CABG <em>as his improved
                            condition reduced the urgency of an immediate redo-CABG</em> ... I
                        asked MS if he had considered the pros and cons, and made up his mind on the
                        redo-CABG, and to let me know if he had any other queries. He confirmed that
                        he had decided to proceed with the redo-CABG on 12 March 2007, and that
                        he had no other queries ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Further, Dr Tong pointed out that the
                    plaintiff’s submissions contradicted her testimony in court. The
                    plaintiff’s submissions stated that the 10 March 2007 discussion
                    regarding the postponement of the surgery took place because MS was unsure about
                    the surgery at that stage and Dr Tong wanted to check if MS indeed wanted
                    to proceed with the surgery. Therefore, the plaintiff said, it was not true that
                    Dr Tong offered MS the option to postpone the surgery on the account that
                    MS’s health was improving.</p>

                    court testimony made it clear that although MS was indeed undecided about the
                    surgery on 9 March 2007, they had decided together on the surgery by the
                    end of that day and she notified Dr Tong of it. The following excerpt is
                    from the portion of the plaintiff’s AEIC (at paragraph 24) describing the
                    events of 9 March 2007:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After meeting Dr MC Tong, I returned to the ward where Steve was
                        resting. At the ward, I informed Steve about my discussion with Dr MC
                        Tong. I told him what Dr MC Tong told me. After a discussion with
                        Steve, <em>we decided that it was in Steve’s best
                            interest to undergo surgery as planned on the 12 March 2007. I then
                            contacted Dr MC Tong’s clinic about our decision</em>.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    I find that MS did notify Dr Tong of
                    his decision to proceed with the surgery on 9 March 2007. On 10 March
                    2007, Dr Tong recorded MS as “[f]eeling better today.” I am
                    satisfied that MS was also aware of the improvement in his health. Taking the
                    evidence of Dr Tong and the plaintiff into account, I find that MS also
                    understood that the improvement in his health was what precipitated
                    Dr Tong’s offer to postpone the redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 2f: Whether Dr Tong informed MS of alternative
                treatment options of OMT and PCI </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Although the plaintiff did not really pursue
                    her claim that MS was not adequately advised of alternative treatments in her
                    written submissions, I state for the record my finding that alternative
                    treatments were adequately advised. The need for information to be given on the
                    alternative treatments is to allow the patient to be apprised of the relative
                    risks and benefits of the available treatments to allow him to make an informed
                    choice as to which treatment to undergo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    The three options typically available to

<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, it is clear that the plaintiff was told by MS’s
                    interventional cardiologist that PCI was not a viable option. Having accepted
                    Dr Christopher Chew’s medical view and confirming it with his own
                    assessment of MS, Dr Tong was under no obligation to provide further advice
                    on the PCI option. In other words, Dr Tong responsibly concurred with
                    Dr Christopher Chew that PCI was not a viable alternative treatment. As
                    stated earlier, a doctor is only under an obligation to provide advice on
                    appropriate treatment options. Hence, his duty to provide advice on PCI was not
                    engaged.</p>

                                            which time he also told me -- well, he told us when a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Further, in Dr Tong’s Clinical
                    Summary, which was recorded contemporaneously with the relevant events, he noted
                    that the “options of to continue conservative medical for ves RedoCABG
                    soon if angina pectoris persisted explained to patient’s wife and patient
                    himself” [<em>sic</em>]. On the evidence, I am
                    satisfied that MS was adequately advised on the alternative of
                OMT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Causation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Even if, contrary to my view, Dr Tong
                    was in breach of his duty to advise, the plaintiff’s claim still fails
                    because there was no causation. The Court of Appeal case of <em>Yeo Peng Hock Henry v Pai Lily</em> [2001] 4 SLR 571
                        (“<em>Yeo Peng Hock</em>”) establishes
                    that to succeed in a medical negligence claim, the plaintiff has to prove, on a
                    balance of probabilities, that the alleged negligent act had <em>caused or materially contributed to the injury</em>. The court held
                    in <em>Yeo Peng Hock</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    Thus, we find that the medical evidence was far
                            from convincing or conclusive on the point whether, had Ms Pai gone to
                            the SGH or SNEC on the evening of 23 December 1996, her left eye would
                            have been saved. The burden of proof rests squarely on Ms Pai, and
                            in our judgment, on the basis of the evidence given by Prof Cartwright
                            and Dr Ang, Ms Pai had not discharged the burden of proving, on a
                            balance of probabilities, that had Dr Yeo advised her to go to the
                            SGH or SNEC immediately on the afternoon of 23 December 1996 and had she
                            gone there that afternoon, her left eye would have been saved. She had
                            therefore not proven that Dr Yeo's negligence and/or breach of duty
                            caused or materially contributed to the loss of her vision in the left
                            eye. On this ground, her claim cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    I noted the plaintiff’s submission
                    that in <em>Chester v Afshar</em> [2005]
                    1 AC 134, the House of Lords held (at [24]) that justice required “a narrow and modest
                    departure from traditional causation principles” to vindicate the
                    claimant’s right of choice and to provide a remedy for the breach.
                    However, that is not the law in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    In the present case, the plaintiff is
                    required to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that MS would not have opted
                    for the redo-CABG if he had been provided the relevant information, namely, a
                    higher specific percentage risk, a comprehensive list of morbidities and an
                    explanation that the two proximities would contribute substantially to the risks
                    of the redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    It was uncontroversial that MS had led an
                    active lifestyle prior to suffering his first MACE. The plaintiff submitted that
                    MS would not have opted for the redo-CABG if he had known the high risk of
                    morbidities which the surgery entailed. She noted that if the morbidities
                    eventuated, MS would find it more difficult to live the active lifestyle that he
                    wished to. However, I find that that argument cuts both ways. MS was already
                    leading a sedentary and rigorously medicated life before his AMI on 9 March
                    2007. After the AMI on 9 March 2007, I do not think he could have hoped for
                    an active lifestyle without undergoing a successful redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    I find that the plaintiff has not discharged
                    her burden and thus her claim on the basis of inadequate advice fails on the
                    ground of causation as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision: Dr Tong did not breach his tortious and contractual
                duties of care in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    Having worked through the foregoing
                    sub-issues and making the findings that I have made, I accordingly find that
                    Dr Tong did not breach the tortious and contractual duties of care he owed
                    to MS in advising MS regarding the redo-CABG. Admittedly, Dr Tong could
                    have been more elaborate in his advice. However, on the evidence of his medical
                    peers and in my analysis, he met the standard of care required of
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Following <em>Gunapathy</em>, the question of the adequacy of medical advice is
                    still largely within the scope of medical judgment (as long as it is not
                    illogical); and I pause here to note that the plaintiff’s testimony has
                    suggested that she might not find it difficult to accept that in a
                    doctor’s responsible medical judgment, he might choose not to fully
                    elaborate on all the potential negative consequences:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Whether the technical aspects of the redo-CABG carried out
                on 12 March 2007 had been properly performed </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    In her SOC, the plaintiff highlighted
                    several sub-issues regarding the specific steps Dr Tong took in the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The plaintiff argued that, for the above
                    listed reasons, Dr Tong’s conduct of the redo-CABG was negligent. I
                    will deal with each sub-issue in turn briefly because, as noted earlier, the
                    plaintiff did not substantially pursue this third head of claim concerning the
                    negligent conduct of the surgery during the trial or in her written submissions.
                    Further, counsel for Dr Tong noted that Dr Blauth, one the
                    plaintiff’s experts, made no criticism of Dr Tong’s conduct of
                    the surgery and it was only Dr Sharma, the plaintiff’s other expert
                    witness, who had some criticisms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 3a: whether Dr Tong ought to have used retrograde
                cardioplegia to protect MS’s heart </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The plaintiff argued that retrograde
                    cardioplegia should have been used in preference to antegrade cardioplegia as
                    this would have better protected MS’s heart during the
                redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    During the trial, counsel for the defendant
                    tendered a document produced by the American College of Cardiology Foundation
                    (“ACC”) and the American Heart Association (“AHA”),
                    the “ACC/AHA 2004 Guideline Update for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft
                    Surgery”, which states at 4.1.2.1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The wide latitude of techniques associated with excellent results for the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Therefore, even though Dr Sharma held
                    the view that retrograde cardioplegia would have been a better form of
                    treatment, he did not go so far as to say that the choice of antegrade
                    cardioplegia was illogical. On a consideration of the evidence, and in
                    particular the views of the ACC and AHA, I find that the decision to use
                    antegrade cardioplegia was not negligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 3b: whether the length of time of the redo-CABG and the
                length of the cardiopulmonary bypass time indicated that the surgery was negligently
                carried out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    MS’s redo-CABG started at 9.00am and
                    ended at 6.55pm on 12 March 2007, <em>ie</em>, the
                    surgery lasted close to ten hours. During the surgery, MS was placed on the
                    cardiopulmonary bypass for 333 minutes and the cross clamp time was 140
                    minutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    It is uncontroversial that one of the
                    factors which might cause sternal wound infection is the length of time spent on
                    the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. However, as acknowledged by Dr Sharma,
                    MS did <em>not</em> suffer any sternal wound
                    infection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    Dr Sharma also conceded that the
                    cross-clamp time of 140 minutes was not unusual. However, he opined that 333
                    minutes was a long time. I note here that Dr Christopher Chew, one of
                    Dr Tong’s factual witnesses, stated during cross-examination that
                    “I guess the total bypass time of over 300 minutes is really quite a
                    significant factor in the length of this operation”. Even so,
                    Dr Sharma accepted that he could not point to any specific action of
                    Dr Tong during the redo-CABG which had led to the prolongation of time but
                    stated that he was unable to do so as there was no dictated note. In the light
                    of this concession, I find that the plaintiff has not satisfied the burden of
                    proof of showing that the length of time <em>in itself</em>
                    was indicative of negligent performance of the redo-CABG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 3c and 3d: whether Dr Tong ought not to have harvested
                the RIMA and whether Dr Tong ought not to have grafted the RIMA onto the
                diagonal LAD system</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    I will deal with these sub-issues together.
                    Under cross-examination, Dr Sharma accepted that the risk associated with
                    using the RIMA, <em>ie</em>, the risk of sternal wound
                    infection, did not materialise in this case. Therefore, while the harvesting and
                    grafting of the RIMA might be contested, it is clear that nothing turned on the
                    procedure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-issue 3e: whether Dr Tong ought not to have used Activated
                Factor VII</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    It was undisputed that MS suffered
                    substantial bleeding perioperatively. It was also undisputed that in an attempt
                    to achieve haemostasis, platelets and fresh frozen plasma were administered but
                    the Medical Team found that these were not sufficient to satisfactorily manage
                    the bleeding. Counsel for the defendant thus urged that the use of Activated
                    Factor VII was reasonable, as the bleeding had to be managed.
                    Dr Sharma’s responses to questions under cross-examination is
                    instructive in this regard:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    While Dr Sharma was adamant that the
                    use of Activated Factor VII was not reasonable, he did not offer any alternative
                    way to stop the bleeding. I take it that there was none. As it is undisputed
                    that the bleeding needed to be managed and as there was no suggested alternative
                    that could be used to achieve haemostasis other than Activated Factor VII, I
                    find it extremely difficult to say that the use of Activated Factor VII was
                    illogical. Therefore, I find that the Dr Tong did not breach his duty of
                    care in using Activated Factor VII.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision: Dr Tong did not breach his tortious and contractual
                duties of care in the performance of the redo-CABG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Having discussed the foregoing sub-issues
                    and making the findings that I have made, I accordingly find that Dr Tong
                    did not breach the tortious and contractual duties of care he owed to MS in his
                    performance of the redo-CABG. It remains for me to add that even the
                    plaintiff’s experts accepted that there was no evidence of any specific
                    instances of wrongdoing in the redo-CABG. Accordingly, I find that Dr Tong
                    met the standard of care required of him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    Until Dr Tong gave evidence during the
                    trial, he had taken the position that he had communicated the 3% risk figure of
                    the redo-CABG to the plaintiff. Accordingly, much time was spent at trial
                    ascertaining with the aid of the experts whether the 3% risk figure was a
                    reasonable figure to have been communicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Dr Tong’s change of position also
                    led to the plaintiff arguing that she was prejudiced by the same.
                    Notwithstanding that the plaintiff’s arguments failed, they were
                    necessitated by Dr Tong’s change of position. Therefore, while the
                    plaintiff’s claim fails, I am of the view that Dr Tong ought to be
                    awarded only 85% of the costs of the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    The plaintiff’s action is accordingly
                    dismissed and she is to pay Dr Tong 85% of the costs of defending the
                    action.</p>
