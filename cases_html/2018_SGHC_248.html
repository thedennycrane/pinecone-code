The plaintiffs had commenced an action against the four defendants for certain payments that were allegedly made wrongfully and sought to recover them. On 28 February 2018, the plaintiffs obtained a Mareva injunction against the first and second defendants which prohibited them from dealing with assets up to a certain value and requiring them to disclose the details of <span class="font-italic">all </span>their assets. Pursuant to the Mareva injunction, the first and second defendants filed three joint affidavits of disclosure, in which they disclosed the details of some, but not all, of their assets. In Summons No 1488 of 2018 (“SUM 1488”), the first and second defendants applied to the court for the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that their disclosure obligations under the Mareva injunction be varied on the basis that the assets that they had disclosed were sufficient to meet the sums restrained by the Mareva injunction and thus further disclosure would serve no purpose but would continue to be an intrusion upon their privacy;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the plaintiffs give certain undertakings not to use the information disclosed for the purposes of civil or criminal proceedings in foreign jurisdictions; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the plaintiffs disclose by affidavit whether they had commenced proceedings, used information, sought enforcement of the Mareva injunction or sought an order of a similar nature that would have required leave of the court had the said undertakings been given on the date that the Mareva injunction was issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing the arguments by the parties on 14 May 2018 and further arguments by the parties on 8 June 2018, I disallowed the application to vary the disclosure obligations under the Mareva injunction. Further, while I agreed with the first and second defendants that it was appropriate to order the plaintiffs to furnish the relevant undertakings, I did not think it was necessary for the plaintiffs to make the disclosure sought by the first and second defendants by way of affidavit. As the first and second defendants have appealed against my decision in respect of the first and third prayers above, I now set out the reasons for my decision. The plaintiffs have not appealed against my decision in respect of the second prayer and thus I will not address that issue in these grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The first to third plaintiffs are Sea Trucks Offshore Ltd, Consolidated Projects Ltd and West African Ventures (C.I.)

He was removed from the board of directors of the fourth plaintiff following its default on the bonds that it had issued. The second defendant, Mariah Binte Mahat, is the first defendant’s partner. She too had been a director in the fourth plaintiff and was also ousted from the board in December 2016 as a result of the bond default. It should be noted, however, that the second defendant had confirmed that in spite of her appointment, she had not provided any services for any of the plaintiffs.

In particular, this was of concern to the creditors who held bonds issued by the fourth plaintiff, as they only held security over the assets of the fourth plaintiff and not the company that the first defendant owned.

Although the second defendant had been a director of the fourth plaintiff, she admitted that she did not make any contributions to any of the plaintiffs (see [5] above); and as for their son, he was three years old when he first began receiving monthly payments and obviously could not have contributed to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that these sums were paid in order to circumvent the limit on the remuneration that the first defendant could receive from the plaintiffs.

In the light of these claims, the issue of the location and details of the first and second defendants’ assets becomes critical, because if the plaintiffs had no means of ensuring that the said assets were not moved, then they ran the risk of obtaining nothing more than a paper judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Although the suit was initially commenced by the first to third plaintiffs, the fourth plaintiff was later added as a party to the suit.

On 28 February 2018, I heard the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> and was satisfied that the requirements for such an injunction were met. I therefore granted the Mareva injunction, under which the first and second defendants were restrained from disposing or dealing with their assets up to the value of US$25,350,328.85 and US$7,385,310 respectively. These sums corresponded to the value of the plaintiffs’ claims against them as indicated in the statement of claim. In addition, para 6 of the Mareva injunction required the first and second defendants to disclose all of their assets by way of affidavit.

They therefore asked if the plaintiffs were agreeable to a variation of the disclosure obligation to this effect.

We therefore invite your clients to agree to a variation of the Freezing Injunction to the effect that upon disclosing assets to the value referred to in the Freezing Injunction (i.e. USD25,350,328.85 in respect of the 1st Defendant and USD7,385,310.00 in respect of the 2nd Defendant), no further obligation is imposed on our clients to declare any additional assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 While the issue of the undisclosed information pertaining to the shares and real property owned by the first defendant was not directly addressed, it was clear that the first and second defendants considered that they did not need to disclose this information despite the assets being specifically named in para 3 of the Mareva injunction.

They noted that the first and second defendants’ failure to disclose was “not by reason of inadvertence or the constraint of time or circumstance, but by choice”, and thus the plaintiffs were left “with little choice but to take the necessary steps to enforce the Freezing Injunction”.

Instead, the absolute position taken by the first and second defendants in this affidavit is consonant with the views expressed in their letters dated 12 and 22 March 2018, in which the first and second defendants had repeatedly asked for a consensual variation of the disclosure obligations such that they would not need to disclose any further information about their assets.

Because the plaintiff is given no interest, security or priority in any of the assets, the only way to allow the plaintiff to effectively police the Mareva injunction is by giving him sufficient information about the location and details of the defendant’s assets, so that he can determine whether the defendant has been moving his assets in breach of the Mareva injunction.

</div> While the first and second defendants had made this point in the context of explaining why they did not make full disclosure of their assets in their first joint affidavit (which is a point I will deal with below), in my view this proposition was equally pertinent to the question of whether disclosure obligations should be discontinued once the defendant has filed an affidavit disclosing assets which were just enough to meet the sum restrained by the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To illustrate the point, I refer to the assets disclosed in the present case. In their first joint affidavit, the first and second defendants disclosed a bank account with Citibank Switzerland that was said to be held solely in the name of the first defendant. The account balance was stated as US$1,770,044.53 and no encumbrances were identified on the said account.

</div> However, in the draft affidavit that was placed before me at the hearing on 8 June 2018 and which was later filed on 13 June 2018 (see [34] above), it was revealed that the funds in the Citibank account were extended pursuant to an “On Demand Credit Facility Agreement” dated 2 April 2015, under which Citibank could demand repayment at any time and, in the meantime, had a security interest over the assets in the bank account.

</div> Although this information was known to the first and second defendants at the time they filed the first joint affidavit, it was not disclosed. Thus, even if the sums in the Citibank account had been sufficient to meet the sums restrained by the Mareva injunction, the existence of such undisclosed encumbrances would have meant that the Mareva injunction would have been deprived of a substantial part of its efficacy. This illustrates the situation which I have explained above: that at best, the disclosure affidavit is a “rough and ready” estimate of the value of the assets which may not truly reflect their true value. Indeed, as the present facts illustrate, there could well also be situations in which a defendant, while disclosing the existence of the assets, deliberately omits to mention the encumbrances on the said assets. In either situation, it would not be safe to free a defendant from the obligation to disclose all his other assets just because the assets in the disclosure affidavit appear, on their face, to meet the sums restrained by the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Further, it is often the case, as is the situation on the present facts (see [37] above), that the Mareva injunction would contain exceptions which allow the defendant to use some of the restrained sums of money towards ordinary expenses and legal fees. So if the defendant only discloses assets that are equal in value or slightly above that restrained by the Mareva injunction, then the use of monies for the purposes of ordinary expenses and legal fees could reduce the value of the assets disclosed to a value below that which had been restrained by the Mareva injunction, further reducing its efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the light of these uncertainties inherent in situations of partial disclosure, I agreed with the plaintiffs that the disclosure obligations of the first and second defendants should not be attenuated even in such situations, in order to preserve the efficacy of the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It was also no answer for the first and second defendants to say that requiring them to make further disclosure of their assets would unjustifiably impinge on their right to privacy or confidentiality. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> in the context of a similarly wide disclosure obligation, the “highly intrusive” nature of such an absolute obligation is tolerated because without an accompanying disclosure obligation, a Mareva injunction will “often be toothless” (at [102]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Because a wide disclosure obligation is typically required to give a Mareva injunction teeth, such widely-phrased disclosure obligations are the norm rather than the exception, and have even been described as being the “standard terms” on which a disclosure order ancillary to a Mareva injunction is made (see <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias </span><span class="font-italic">Wong Ming Kiong) and others</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 74 (“<span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>”)

</div> at [48]). Indeed, as I have noted at [12] above, the standard form disclosure order, as contained in para 2 of Form 7 of Appendix A of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, requires a defendant to disclose <span class="font-italic">all</span> his assets, even though the substantive terms of the Mareva injunction in the same standard form only restrain the assets of the defendant up to the sum that is reasonably claimed by the plaintiff in the underlying proceedings. This shows that as a general rule, a defendant will be required to make disclosure of <span class="font-italic">all</span> his assets even though the assets restrained are limited to those of a certain value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In contrast, it has only been in cases where the disclosure obligations go <span class="font-italic">further</span> than requiring the defendant to disclose all his assets that the court has found such obligations to be overly onerous. In <span class="font-italic">Wallace</span> (see <span class="font-italic">supra</span> [47]), the Court of Appeal held that the disclosure obligations were “totally unjustified” because they not only required the appellant to disclose all his assets, but also required him to give his consent for his bankers to provide “any information” to the respondent upon request (at [34]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Petromar Energy Resources Pte Ltd v Glencore International AG</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1152 (“<span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>”), the Court of Appeal concluded that disclosure obligations requiring the defendant to disclose all its assets <span class="font-italic">and</span> to specifically disclose information pertaining to certain specific items of assets were “far too wide and extensive to be made at such an early stage” of the proceedings (at [17]). These cases demonstrate that it is only in situations where the disclosure order has imposed obligations over and above what is necessary to police the Mareva injunction that the court has stepped in to attenuate the disclosure obligations. But as I have explained, this concern does not apply to situations of partial disclosure given the inherent uncertainties arising from the “rough and ready” information provided in such situations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For the foregoing reasons, I do not accept the first and second defendants’ contention that they were entitled to a variation of the disclosure obligation simply by virtue of having disclosed assets in their first joint affidavit that appeared to have met the sums restrained in the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This does not mean, however, that a defendant’s disclosure obligations in the context of a Mareva injunction can <span class="font-italic">never</span> be attenuated. There may well be circumstances which call for such a variation, for instance if it can be shown that the plaintiff is using the disclosure order not for the purpose of policing the Mareva injunction, but for an extraneous purpose such as to obtain information to support the plaintiff’s other claims against the defendant (see <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span> at [21]). In the present case, however, the first and second defendants did not allege that the plaintiffs had such an extraneous purpose in demanding that the first and second defendants fully disclose their assets, and in any event, I was of the view that the plaintiffs’ request for information pertaining to the first and second defendants’ assets was entirely <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. Indeed, for the reasons that follow, I was not convinced that the circumstances of this case called for the first and second defendants’ disclosure obligations to be attenuated. To the contrary, I found that the first and second defendants had been evasive and uncooperative in their compliance with their disclosure obligations and should thus be required to make full disclosure of their assets. I turn to this next.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the first and second defendants were otherwise entitled to a variation of their disclosure obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The first and second defendants accepted that para 6 of the Mareva injunction imposed an “absolute” and “unconditional” obligation on them to disclose information pertaining to all their assets (see [29] above). Despite acknowledging this, it can be seen from the detailed chronology of events that I have set out above that they had consciously chosen not to comply with the disclosure order because they did not think it was necessary to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Against this, the first and second defendants contended that they had tried their best to obtain information of their assets but had been unable to do so. I did not accept this explanation. It was evident from the conduct of the first and second defendants that their actions were as a result of choice and not circumstance. The key facts in this regard are the following.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the first and second defendants had repeatedly taken the position that there was no further utility that could be obtained by disclosing more information about their assets, given their belief that the purpose of the Mareva injunction had been met: see for instance the letter of 22 March 2018 (at [19] above) and the second joint affidavit filed in support of SUM 1488 (at [22] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the conduct of the first and second defendants is consonant with the position that they had expressed. In their first joint affidavit, the first and second defendants failed to even provide information pertaining to the assets that had been specifically identified in para 3 of the Mareva injunction as being subject to the terms of the injunction (see [16] above). While more information was eventually furnished by way of the draft affidavit, this information was still incomplete: for instance, no information was provided as to the real properties located in the Netherlands (see [34(b)] above). The natural inference arising from the non-disclosure of such information coupled with the statements made by the first and second defendants in the documents was that they were unwilling, rather than unable, to provide the said information.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, it is true that the first and second defendants had made assurances that they would provide the court and the plaintiffs with more information (see the first joint affidavit at [17] above and the letter of 22 March 2018 at [20] above) and had eventually explained in their fourth joint affidavit that they had attempted to contact their banks but had been rebuffed (see [25] above). In my view, however, these assurances and explanations rang hollow. The assurances which had been given in the first joint affidavit and the letter of 22 March 2018 were not acted upon until the plaintiffs made clear in their letter of 27 April 2018 that if no further information or explanation was provided, they would apply to cross-examine the first and second defendants on their first joint affidavit (see [24] above). It was only when faced with the spectre of cross-examination that the first and second defendants filed their fourth joint affidavit explaining the situation. And even then, the explanation given was, in my view, unsatisfactory. No evidence was adduced to show that the first and second defendants had followed up on the email that they had sent to their banks on 14 March 2018. And although the first and second defendants explained that their personal secretary had called the banks but had been rebuffed, no affidavit was filed by the said secretary explaining how or why the bank officers had rejected the inquiries and whether further steps had been taken in that regard. Further, this explanation appears to contradict the documentary evidence. For instance, in the sixth joint affidavit that was filed on 4 June 2018, the first and second defendants exhibited a bank statement from an account with DBS Bank Ltd that was dated 31 March 2018 (see [33(c)] above), indicating that this bank statement had been in their possession at the time the first and second defendants were claiming ignorance, but had not been disclosed. It was thus not a case where the first and second defendants had no information in their possession that could be disclosed despite trying their best to obtain this information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Taking the evidence in the round, I was unable to accept the first and second defendants’ contention that they had tried their best to comply with their disclosure obligations but were prevented from doing so. My conclusion in this regard also comports with the nature of the claims that had been made by the plaintiffs in this case. As I noted at [8] above, the plaintiffs in essence claimed that the first and second defendants had sowed a conspiracy against the plaintiffs, had used the third and fourth defendants to carry out this conspiracy, and had reaped the benefits of the conspiracy in the form of the payments made by the plaintiffs to the defendants. The assets of the first and second defendants thus became critical to the enforcement of any judgment that may be obtained by the plaintiffs in the suit and this may explain why the first and second defendants were reluctant to disclose the location and the details of their assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In fact, even after the court had decided on 14 May 2018 that the disclosure obligations would not be varied, the first and second defendants continued to “drip-feed” the court and the plaintiffs with snippets of information. In the meantime, they held out for the possibility that their fates would take a turn for the better, either by way of further arguments to this court (which were to be heard on 8 June 2018), or by way of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, which is why an application for leave to appeal had been filed even before the further arguments were heard (see [32] above). I should also note that while this information was not available to the court at the time of the hearings of 14 May 2018 and 8 June 2018, it can be seen from the events following 8 June 2018 that the first and second defendants had taken further steps to reverse their fortunes, for instance by applying to discharge the entire Mareva injunction or to stay the underlying proceedings in favour of the courts of Nigeria (see [38] above). Again, it was likely that this was the approach taken by the first and second defendants because they did not wish to open their assets to the plaintiffs in the event that the plaintiffs prevailed in the underlying suit, but this did not make their approach legitimate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Turning back to the strategy of “drip-feeding”, while the first and second defendants purported to comply immediately with their disclosure obligations under para 6 of the Mareva injunction, they insisted that they would only be prepared to state the location and details of their assets on affidavit in stages and at their own convenience (see [28] above). Thus, although they provided the court and the plaintiffs with further information about their assets on three separate occasions, on each occasion it was clear that the information provided only served to provide minimal compliance with their disclosure obligations. I mention just four instances.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, while the first and second defendants had disclosed a HSBC bank account in their letter dated 17 May 2018 (see [28(b)] above), the only information provided in relation to the assets contained within it was a customer overview dated 16 May 2018, which provided limited information. But subsequently, in their sixth joint affidavit dated 4 June 2018, when the first and second defendants finally disclosed information pertaining to this bank account by way of affidavit, it turned out that there was an additional supporting document for this account – a bank account statement dated 7 May 2018 (see [33(a)] above). This bank account statement would have been available to the first and second defendants at the time they sent the letter of 17 May 2018, but clearly, they had chosen not to disclose it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the same technique was employed in relation to the DBS bank account that was disclosed by the first and second defendants in their sixth joint affidavit dated 4 June 2018 (see [33(c)] above). The first and second defendants had held a bank account statement in respect of this account since 31 March 2018 but chose not to disclose it until 4 June 2018.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, in respect of the first and second defendants’ shareholdings in Jamaro Development Company and Jamaro Capital Limited that were also disclosed in the sixth joint affidavit dated 4 June 2018 (see [33(b)] above), only the names of the companies and the number of shares the first and second defendants held were disclosed. But no information was disclosed, for instance, as to where these companies were incorporated, which was a critical piece of information which would have been necessary for the plaintiffs to monitor compliance with the Mareva injunction. Counsel for the first and second defendants also admitted that he did not possess this information when I queried him on this during the hearing of 8 June 2018. Further, the documents filed in support of this disclosure pertained to the statements of share capital and returns of allotment as of 2014, which would not have necessarily reflected the sums that had actually been paid up by the first and second defendants, nor would it have necessarily reflected their shareholdings as of the date of the application. It was thus clear to me that even where information about the assets had been disclosed, the first and second defendants had chosen to disclose the minimum information necessary to comply with their disclosure obligations, but had chosen to leave out crucial aspects of that information, with the result that the plaintiffs were hamstrung in their ability to police the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, apart from the information that had been disclosed but was incomplete, I also note that some information had in fact not been disclosed at all. For instance, it appeared that the first defendant had, in September 2016, filed a financial statement for a financial order in divorce proceedings in London. That financial statement contained information pertaining to certain properties and shares that were being held by the first defendant. But despite being in possession of such information since September 2016, neither this information nor the financial statement was disclosed to the court by the first and second defendants. It was only when the <span class="font-italic">plaintiffs</span> subsequently obtained this information that it was disclosed to the court in an affidavit filed by the plaintiffs on 25 June 2018 (see [31] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Such a strategy is not new. A similar strategy of filing “holding affidavits” was criticised in <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span> (see <span class="font-italic">supra</span> [52]). In that case, the plaintiffs obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction against the defendants which contained similar standard form disclosure obligations. The plaintiffs complained that the defendants did not comply with their disclosure obligations as their affidavits of assets were incomplete and lacking in particulars. They thus applied to cross-examine the defendants on their affidavits. Agreeing with the plaintiffs, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J held that (at [48]–[49]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 The disclosure obligation was in standard terms … The defendants’ affidavits should have contained a proper and full list of assets, and <span class="font-italic">should not have been produced for the sake of meeting a deadline or to serve and operate as a holding affidavit pending determination of the defendants’ appeal to set aside the worldwide injunction</span>. There has to be proper compliance before a list of assets can qualify as a comprehensive list. <span class="font-italic">The strategy </span><span class="font-italic">of using holding affidavits defeats the effectiveness of worldwide Mareva orders</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 <span class="font-italic">I use the expression “holding affidavit” as I am convinced that the defendants had not really tried to properly comply with the disclosure obligation</span>. The majority defendants had cited insufficient time as an excuse. It was a poor excuse. The plaintiffs’ review of the affidavits and lists filed showed that the defendants were not treating their disclosure and other obligations under the Mareva order seriously. <span class="font-italic">The majority defendants seemed to have done their best to hedge the situation they faced with minimal compliance whilst waiting for a hearing date for the appeal. The defendants’ stance, however foolish it might have been, was nevertheless deliberate</span>. They obviously hoped to “get by” with the holding affidavits. It was not to be, particularly when they had adversaries as resolute as the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Belinda Ang J granted the plaintiffs’ application to cross-examine the defendants because she was of the view that while the defendants had filed affidavits of assets, they were not seriously trying to comply with their obligations and instead only filed the affidavits to stave off the court-imposed deadline while waiting for a hearing date for an appeal. Belinda Ang J did not endorse this strategy of deliberately using a “holding affidavit” in place of proper compliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Although <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span> pertained to a situation where the plaintiffs sought to cross-examine the defendants, in my view, the same analysis relating to the strategy of “holding affidavits” could apply in the present case. As I have concluded above, the first and second defendants had consciously chosen not to comply with their “absolute, unconditional” obligations under para 6 of the Mareva injunction. And even after the court order of 14 May 2018 was made, they had chosen to continue to file “holding affidavits” to, in Belinda Ang J’s words, “hedge the situation they faced with minimal compliance” (see <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span> at [49]) whilst waiting for their fortunes to turn around. Like Belinda Ang J, I was of the view that this strategy ought not to be endorsed, lest the efficacy of Mareva injunctions and the disclosure obligations contained within them be undermined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For the foregoing reasons, I found that the first and second defendants had not been serious in complying with their disclosure obligations and had instead been evasive and uncooperative in doing so. In the circumstances, there was no reason to grant the first and second defendants a variation of their disclosure obligations to the effect that they no longer needed to disclose any further information about their assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision in relation to the need for the plaintiffs to disclose by affidavit whether they had used the information obtained</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I now turn to briefly set out my reasons for declining the first and second defendants’ application for an order that the plaintiffs depose an affidavit to declare whether they had used the information disclosed by the first and second defendants from the date of the Mareva injunction until the date that the undertakings were given. I had agreed with the first and second defendants that it was appropriate for the plaintiffs to furnish undertakings not to use the information for the purposes of civil or criminal proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. The plaintiffs furnished the relevant undertakings on in an affidavit dated 18 May 2018, but which were to take effect from 14 May 2018 (see [27] above). Thus, the only proceedings that would have been disclosed in any such affidavit to be filed by the plaintiffs would be in relation to information that had been disclosed by the first and second defendants prior to 14 May 2018 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in their first joint affidavit).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, the preponderance of information that had been disclosed by the first and second defendants in their first joint affidavit pertained to assets that had already been known to the plaintiffs and were therefore specifically listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction. So even if the plaintiffs had commenced proceedings by relying on their prior information of such assets of the first and second defendants, these proceedings would not have been commenced pursuant to information that had been obtained as a result of the first and second defendants’ disclosure of information. It was thus not necessary for me to require the plaintiffs to set out the existence and details of such proceedings in an affidavit. Indeed, although there have been numerous hearings since my decision on this issue on 14 May 2018, the first and second defendants have not alleged that there have been any new proceedings commenced by the plaintiffs using the information that had been disclosed in their first joint affidavit. This only serves to confirm my conclusion that such an affidavit was not necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Further, I note that the existence and details of other parallel proceedings had already been set out in detail by the first and second defendants themselves in their second joint affidavit dated 3 April 2018 filed in support of SUM 1488.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It was thus clear to me that in any event, the first and second defendants have had ample knowledge of the existence of such proceedings. In these circumstances, it was not necessary to order the plaintiffs to file such an affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In summary, I dismissed the first and second defendants’ application to vary their disclose obligations for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Disclosure obligations which require a defendant to disclose all his assets are essential to the operation of a Mareva injunction, because this is the only way in which a plaintiff can police a defendant’s compliance with the terms of the injunction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This reasoning continues to apply even where a defendant has, by way of affidavit, appeared to disclose assets which are sufficient to meet the maximum sums restrained by the Mareva injunction. This is because affidavits of disclosure often do not reflect the true value of the assets disclosed, and it would thus not be safe to discharge further disclosure obligations purely on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Nevertheless, there may be situations in which a defendant should be granted an attenuation of his disclosure obligations, including but not limited to a situation in which a plaintiff has used the information obtained by the disclosure orders for extraneous purposes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) There were no circumstances which called for such an attenuation in the present case. To the contrary, the first and second defendants had been evasive and uncooperative and had not seriously tried to comply with their disclosure obligations. And even after the court had declined to vary their disclosure obligations on 14 May 2018, they continued to “drip-feed” the court and the plaintiffs with “holding affidavits”. In such circumstances, the first and second defendants should not be allowed an attenuation of their disclosure obligations. While the first and second defendants may have been reluctant to disclose information about the location and details of their assets to the plaintiffs given the nature of the claims made, this did not mean that their approach was legitimate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I further dismissed the first and second defendants’ application for an order that the plaintiffs disclose the existence of proceedings on affidavit because the preponderance of information disclosed in the first joint affidavit of the first and second defendants had disclosed information that was already known to the plaintiffs, and in any event, the first and second defendants had ample knowledge of the existence of these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Ang  <br/>Senior Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Daniel Chia and Christine Ong (Coleman Street Chambers LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Teh Kee Wee Lawrence, Ravin Periasamy and Chan Wai Yi Kevin (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the first and second defendants;<br/>Third and fourth defendants unrepresented and absent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
