</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">2        Six other charges against the appellant

were initially stood down but the DPP applied for them to be taken into consideration

later in the trial. For the first charge, the trial judge sentenced him to five

years’ imprisonment and for the second charge, he was sentenced to 18 months’

imprisonment. The trial judge ordered the sentences to run consecutively, bringing the

total imprisonment period to six and a half years. The other six charges were taken into

consideration for the purposes of sentencing.</p>
<p xmlns="">3        The appellant appealed against both

conviction and sentence. After hearing counsels’ arguments, I dismissed both the

appeal against conviction and sentence. I now give my reasons. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The case for the prosecution</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">4        At the trial below, the prosecution led

evidence from six witnesses through conditioned statements as well as by oral testimony.

The most crucial evidence against the appellant came from PW1 Saravanan A/L Kaliannan

("Saravanan") and PW3 Kumar s/o Srinivasan ("Kumar"). </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Saravanan’s statements</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">5        At the material time, Saravanan was working

in Seagate Technology International ("Seagate") as an assistant technician. His

job scope included the operation of a sputter machine (used to sputter media discs used in

the production of hard disks). As part of his job, he was in charge of sending the used

targets to the vendor to be reclaimed. The vendor to Seagate at the material time was

Heraeus Precision Engineering Pte Ltd ("Heraeus"). </p>
<p xmlns="">6        Saravanan testified that, sometime in March

2001, the appellant had contacted him and asked him to steal used platinum targets from

Seagate, which would then be shipped to Japan. The appellant promised to pay Saravanan

$250 for each target. At this point, Saravanan refused to take part in the scheme. </p>
<p xmlns="">7        Two days later, the appellant approached

Saravanan with the same suggestion. Instead, Saravanan came up with a counter proposal and

offered to sell to the appellant two used platinum targets from another manufacturer,

Tosoh ("‘Tosoh’ targets") which he had misappropriated sometime in

November 2000. The appellant agreed to buy the ‘Tosoh’ targets for $200 each and

the two arranged to meet up in two days’ time at the Woodlands Central

McDonald’s restaurant. </p>
<p xmlns="">8        At the meeting, the appellant accepted the

two ‘Tosoh’ targets and paid Saravanan $400. (It was agreed at trial that the

value of each of these ‘Tosoh’ targets referred to in DAC 57462/2001 was

US$3,500 each.) On this occasion, the appellant once again brought up the idea of stealing

used Heraeus targets. Saravanan stated that the appellant managed to convince him that he

(Saravanan) would not get caught, so Saravanan agreed to the plan. </p>
<p xmlns="">9        A week later, the appellant called

Saravanan at work and asked if there were extra targets for him. Saravanan confirmed that

there were and the appellant went to Seagate. Two used targets were passed over to him.

Saravanan stated that subsequently he would pass the used Heraeus targets to Kumar,

Heraeus’s driver. On these occasions, he would get a white envelope from Kumar, which

contained money that the appellant had asked Kumar to pass to him. </p>
<p xmlns="">10        Sometime in November 2001, when it became

evident to Seagate that targets had been stolen, Saravanan met the appellant at one

Farmart Seafood Restaurant where Saravanan was paid a final $1,000 and was assured by the

appellant that all the targets had been shipped to Japan. </p>
<p xmlns="">11        Saravanan pleaded guilty to the charge of

committing criminal breach of trust as a servant by dishonestly misappropriating 48 used

platinum targets. He was convicted on 4 March 2002 and sentenced to four years’

imprisonment. Another charge of criminal misappropriation of two ‘Tosoh’ used

platinum targets was taken into consideration. Saravanan was serving sentence when he gave

evidence for the prosecution against the appellant. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Kumar’s statements</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">12        At the material time, Kumar was a driver

for Heraeus. His job scope at that time included sending new targets to, and collecting

used targets from, Seagate. He gave evidence that from around March 2001, Saravanan would

give him a few used targets that were not registered or recorded in the returned targets

invoice. He also gave evidence that on some of these occasions, the appellant would inform

him just before the collection that there would be targets for experiments and that he was

to collect them from Saravanan. </p>
<p xmlns="">13        He stated that he made about ten such

trips where he collected used targets that were not registered or recorded in the returned

target invoice. On each occasion, there would be between two to four such extra targets. </p>
<p xmlns="">14        More importantly, he stated that on a few

occasions, before he left for Seagate, the appellant would pass him a white envelope

bearing the company’s letterhead and that the appellant instructed him on these

occasions to hand over the envelope to the appellant. He stated that he delivered them to

Saravanan as he was told. </p>
<p xmlns="">15        Kumar stated that, upon returning to the

office from such trips, he would deliver the used targets either to the storeman, one

Thanabal, or to the appellant personally. He also stated that on two such occasions, upon

returning to the office with the used targets, the appellant taught him how to weigh the

used targets. The appellant then asked him to switch them with heavier used targets

(scheduled to be returned to the United States) which had been properly recorded in the

invoice. However, he could not remember exactly how many of such targets he had switched

on the appellant’s instructions. </p>
<p xmlns="">16        Sometime in October 2001, Kumar received a

phone call from the appellant while he was in the office. He stated that the appellant

told him to take six pieces of the used targets which the appellant was keeping under the

table and to put them on the false ceiling in his office. When asked why he needed to do

this, the appellant told Kumar that he did not want the representatives from Seagate to

find out that the six targets were in the company. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p>Statements from other witnesses</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">17        Apart from Saravanan and Kumar, three

other prosecution witnesses gave evidence which implicated the appellant. PW6 Tan Wee Kiat

("Tan"), a Seagate investigator, gave evidence that he lodged a police report on

30 November 2001 when he noticed that there were 48 used targets missing from

Seagate’s inventory. PW7 Senior Investigating Office Javier Neo ("Neo") was

assigned to the case. On 3 December 2001, Neo was informed by Kumar that the appellant had

instructed him to hide the six platinum targets in the false ceiling. Neo acted on the

information and raided the Heraeus office where the six targets were recovered. Tan

confirmed that the serial numbers of these six targets matched those of the platinum

targets missing from Seagate. </p>
<p xmlns="">18        PW2 Perabu A/L Natarajan

("Perabu") gave evidence that the appellant had asked him to photocopy

certificates of analysis for the used targets which had been collected. It was also

Perabu’s evidence that this was not the usual practice. The prosecution also adduced

evidence from PW4 Krishnamoorthy Ramesh ("Ramesh") who gave evidence that

sometime in October 2001, when the Seagate investigators had asked for documents

pertaining to the lost platinum targets, the appellant asked him to cover all the pen

markings on the used target logsheets before photocopying them. He also confirmed that the

used platinum targets were handed directly to the appellant on a number of occasions. Tan

stated that, had he seen the handwritten markings on the used target logsheets which

Ramesh was asked to cover up, he would have immediately concluded that someone in Heraeus

was involved in the theft.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The defence</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">19        The appellant’s defence on both

charges in the court below was that he was not the mastermind of the conspiracy. Rather,

he was merely carrying out the instructions of his superior, one Ramachandran Viswanathan

("Ram"). Ram was a director of Heraeus at the material time. In his

examination-in-chief, he alleged that he met with Saravanan at the McDonald’s

restaurant on instruction from Ram. However, he did not call on Ram to give evidence to

support his case.</p>
<p xmlns="">20        He also denied that he had called

Saravanan at the latter’s office to check on the quantity of used targets for

collection. He insisted that the standard procedure was for Seagate to send an e-mail to

Heraeus regarding the number of targets to be collected. Hence, there was no need for him

to call Saravanan. However, he admitted that he was aware of used targets being taken out

by Saravanan and being passed to Heraeus but he alleged once again that this was done on

the instruction of Ram. </p>
<p xmlns="">21        As for his conduct vis--vis Kumar, he

admitted that he did ask Kumar to weigh the used targets and to switch the heavier ones

meant to be shipped to the US and replace them with lighter ones passed over by Saravanan.

Yet again, he alleged that he did this on the instructions of Ram, who was not called to

substantiate his allegations. </p>
<p xmlns="">22        As for explaining why he had asked Kumar

to move the six targets to the false ceiling, he claimed that that was done on the

instructions of his new boss, one Dan Holland. As was the case with Ram, the appellant did

not call Dan Holland as a witness. More importantly, he failed to mention the Dan

Holland’s involvement in this episode in his statement to the police. When asked to

explain his inconsistency during cross-examination, he said that he had lied to the police

in his earlier statement because he was under a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the company

and he did not want to reveal anything which might be in contravention of that agreement. </p>
<p xmlns="">23        The appellant called on DW2 Veeravalli

Raghavan ("Raghavan"), a director of Nishtha Engineering Pte Ltd, a company

dealing with electrical and electronic components. He gave evidence that he had received

42 used targets from Ram and that Ram had given him instructions to cut those targets into

smaller parts. However, he gave evidence to the effect that he did not check the serial

numbers of the targets that Ram had handed over to him. The appellant’s contention

was that these 42 targets were the ones which had been stolen from Seagate. </p>
<p xmlns="">24        However, during cross-examination of

Raghavan, the DPP sought to admit a list (obtained from Heraeus’ records) containing

the serial numbers of the 42 targets that had been handed over to Raghavan. This list was

admitted without objection from defence counsel. It was the DPP’s submission that

none of those serial numbers matched those that were missing from Seagate. As such, the 48

targets handed over to Raghavan could not have been part of the 48 stolen targets.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision of the trial judge below</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">25        In examining Saravanan’s statements,

the trial judge was mindful of the fact that Saravanan was an accomplice and thus

scrutinised his statement with caution. He conceded that there were some inconsistencies

in Saravanan’s statements but found these inconsistencies to be minor and that they

did not discredit his entire evidence. He noted that Saravanan had already been dealt with

for the offences that he had committed. He also observed that the defence did not advance

reasons as to why Saravanan should implicate the appellant if what Saravanan had stated

was not the truth. On those two counts, he accepted the evidence of Saravanan. </p>
<p xmlns="">26        He also chose not to accept the

appellant’s defence. He found difficulty in accepting various parts of his evidence

in cross-examination where he merely gave a series of ‘I do not know’ answers to

pertinent questions. For example, he was asked whether it would be very suspicious for an

assistant technician like Saravanan to sell two used Tosoh targets to him without any

proper documentation. His reply was, "I do not know." He noted that the

appellant was not a nave person but was an experienced person in this line of business.

Thus, the trial judge found his ambivalent answers to be a mere pretence in an attempt to

avoid answering those questions. More importantly, he found that although the appellant

had claimed that he was acting on the instructions of Ram and Dan Holland, he did not call

them to substantiate his bare allegations. </p>
<p xmlns="">27        Consequently, he convicted the appellant

on both charges and sentenced him to a total of six and a half years imprisonment after

taking into account the appellant’s mitigation plea. The notes of evidence showed

that the trial judge took into account the following factors in sentencing the appellant: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    The seriousness of the offences committed by the appellant and

    the penalty prescribed by law for such offences; </p>
<p>(b)    The facts of the case as revealed by the evidence, including the

    nature and the value of the property involved and the period over which the offences were

    committed; </p>
<p>(c)    The six charges taken into consideration for the purposes of

    sentence;</p>
<p>(d)    The sentence meted out to his accomplice, Saravanan; </p>
<p>(e)    The mitigation plea made by counsel, in particular that the

    appellant had no antecedents; </p>
<p>(f)    That the appellant appeared to be the mastermind of the

    conspiracy and that he did not appear to be remorseful for what he had done during the

    conduct of his defence. Moreover, he noted that the appellant blamed his company’s

    management for his various activities.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal against conviction</p>
<p></p></b></i>28        Counsel for the appellant raised

the following issues on appeal against conviction: 

<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    Whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that

    Saravanan dishonestly appropriated 48 pieces of used Heraeus targets as stated in the

    charge; </p>
<p>(b)    Whether the trial judge had erred both in law and in fact in his

    finding that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Saravanan to commit criminal

    breach of trust; and </p>
<p>(c)    Whether the prosecution failed to prove that the 48 targets which

    were stolen were entrusted to Saravanan. </p>
<p>(d)    As for the second charge, whether the trial judge had erred in

    law by failing to give the appellant the benefit of doubt since it was Ram who gave

    instructions for the collection of the stolen targets from Seagate. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Whether the prosecution had proven the exact number of targets in the

charge beyond reasonable doubt</p></b>
<p></p></i>29        Counsel argued that the prosecution

did not manage to prove all 48 targets had been misappropriated. He painstakingly tried to

show that, from the statements of the witnesses, nobody could be sure that there were

exactly 48 targets involved in the whole transaction. For example, he pointed out that

Kumar, in his oral evidence, said that the total number of targets could have been about

35. 

<p xmlns="">30        I was of the view that the discrepancy

involved here was immaterial. This was particularly so because Saravanan, the principal

offender, in his cautioned statement, stated: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">In total I have stolen <u>at least 40</u> used platinum

    targets from the company and <u>I had sold all of them to Amir</u> [the accused].

    (emphasis added)</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">31        I was also mindful of the fact that

Saravanan, the principal offender, had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 408 of the Penal

Code involving exactly 48 targets. This was very strong evidence that the number of

targets in the charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Further, the defence did

not raise any evidence both here and in the trial below to show that some of those 48

targets had been passed to a person other than the appellant. Therefore, I rejected this

argument from the appellant’s counsel and found that the prosecution had proven the

number of targets in the charge beyond reasonable doubt. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Whether the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Saravanan to

commit criminal breach of trust</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">32        Next, counsel argued that the trial judge

erred in law and in fact in finding that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with

Saravanan to commit criminal breach of trust. For this argument, he relied on a number of

contentions. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the appellant had to be the mastermind of the conspiracy</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">33        First, he tried to show that the appellant

was not the mastermind of the conspiracy but merely carrying out the instructions of Ram.

He relied on the evidence from Kumar where he stated that on one of the occasions, he had

passed the targets to Ram instead of the appellant. </p>
<p xmlns="">34        I found this contention to be

unmeritorious. For the charge of abetting Saravanan in committing criminal breach of trust

by conspiracy, the prosecution had to establish the following elements under s 107(b) of

the Penal Code: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    the person abetting must engage with one or more

    other persons in a conspiracy; </p>
<p align="justify">(b)    the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing

    abetted; and </p>
<p align="justify">(c)    an act or illegal omission must take place in

    pursuance of the conspiracy. </p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Section 107(b) of the Penal Code not require the accused person to be

the mastermind before a charge for abetment by conspiracy can be proved. The fact that the

appellant may not have been the mastermind was therefore irrelevant. </p>
<p xmlns="">35        In any case, I found that the allegations

that Ram was the mastermind to be completely unsubstantiated. The appellant did not call

Ram as a witness to support his allegation and the trial judge was correct in disbelieving

the appellant’s allegations in the absence of corroboration from Ram. I saw no reason

to disturb that finding. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Accomplice evidence</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">36        Counsel proceeded to argue that

Saravanan’s testimony was highly unbelievable and should not form the basis of the

appellant’s conviction. I found that there was little merit in this argument as well.

An issue arose here because Saravanan was the appellant’s accomplice. However, I

found that the trial judge’s approach to Saravanan’s testimony was beyond

reproach. </p>
<p xmlns="">37        The law on the treatment of evidence of <a name="kw20">accomplice</a>s in Singapore is very well settled. In <i>Tan Hung Yeoh v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48670&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 3 SLR 93</a>, I held that the court may convict an accused person based on the uncorroborated

evidence of an <a name="kw21">accomplice</a>: see, for example, <strong><i>Chua Poh Kiat

Anthony v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46368&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 713</a> and <i>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46104&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 592</a></strong>.

The corroboration warning against an accomplice's evidence is no longer mandatory in law:

s 135 Evidence Act (Cap 97). All that the court is required to do is to treat the evidence

of an <a name="kw23">accomplice</a> with caution as the <a name="kw24">accomplice</a> may,

not must, be presumed to be unworthy of credit: see s 116 illustration (b) Evidence Act

and <strong><i>Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP</i></strong>,<b> </b><strong><i>Kwang Boon Keong

Peter v PP</i></strong>. </p>
<p xmlns="">38        Here, it was evident that the trial judge

had cautioned himself that Saravanan was an accomplice and he had meticulously perused the

evidence before him before coming to the conclusion to believe Saravanan’s testimony.

It is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb a trial judge’s findings of

fact, particularly when they are based on the assessment of credibility of witnesses. This

is so because the appellate court does not have the opportunity of examining the

witnesses: see <i>Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49426&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 111</a>.

Further, I could see no reason or incentive for Saravanan to implicate the appellant in a

bid to reduce his own complicity in the affair. Before the appellant’s trial,

Saravanan had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 408 of the Penal Code and was sentenced

to four years’ imprisonment. At the time of the appellant’s trial, Saravanan

gave evidence while he was serving his sentence. Like the trial judge, I could see no

reason to disbelieve his testimony and I rejected counsel’s argument on this ground. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the targets sold to Raghavan by Ram could have been part of the

48 misappropriated targets</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">39        Next, counsel sought to distance the

appellant from the crime by asking the court to draw an inference that the 42 targets

which Ram sold to Raghavan for cutting formed part of the 48 targets that had been

misappropriated from Seagate. I saw no merit in this argument. This argument was highly

speculative and counsel adduced no evidence to substantiate the veracity of his

allegation. </p>
<p xmlns="">40        On the contrary, the prosecution adduced a

list of serial numbers of targets that had been sold to Raghavan from Heraeus’

records (Exhibit P24). Raghavan testified that P24 was indeed a list of serial numbers of

the targets that had been sold to his company but he stated that he did not check to see

if the serial numbers of the targets matched those that were given in the list. The

prosecution then pointed out that none of the serial numbers in P24 matched those of the

targets that were missing from Seagate. I found the evidence adduced by the prosecution in

P24 to be sufficiently convincing to rebut the inference that counsel sought to draw. </p>
<p xmlns="">41        Further, counsel tried to argue that the

list in P24 contained a list of fictitious numbers cooked up by Ram in order to cover up

the whole scheme. I found this argument to be extremely unmeritorious. It has to be noted

that in the trial below, P24 was admitted with the counsel’s consent after a copy of

the exhibit had been served on him. Therefore, under s 60(1) of the Evidence Act, P24 was

deemed to be admitted without the need of proof. Section 60(1) of the Evidence Act states:

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the

    parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing or which before the hearing

    they agree to admit by any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in

    force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">42        Having consented to the admission of the

document, I found that counsel was precluded from challenging the veracity of that

document on appeal. Consequently, I found his allegation that P24 contained a list of

fictitious numbers to be a display of counsel’s lack of adequate preparation of the

case prior to the appeal. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Failure to call Thanabal the storeman as a witness</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">43        Counsel proceeded to argue that the

failure to call on Thanabal the storeman prejudiced the case for the appellant. He sought

to argue that Thanabal would have been material in demonstrating that Ram was also

involved in the conspiracy because Ram had given Thanabal certain instructions to keep the

stolen targets. It appeared to me that counsel was trying to argue that an adverse

inference should have been drawn against the prosecution’s failure to call on

Thanabal under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. </p>
<p xmlns="">44        It appeared to me that this was but

another one of counsel’s many valiant attempts at raising issues in the hope that he

would end up with a meritorious ground. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I failed

to see how the prosecution’s failure to call on Thanabal as a witness could have

possibly prejudiced the appellant’s case. It is trite law that the prosecution is

entitled to decide which witnesses it wishes to call. If the prosecution does not call on

a particular material witness, the prosecution bears the risk that the case against the

appellant is not proven beyond reasonable doubt. </p>
<p xmlns="">45        After a perusal of the evidence and the

circumstances under which this case arose, I was of the view that Thanabal’s

testimony would have added little to the case. As I have observed above, in a charge of

abetment by conspiracy, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the

appellant was the mastermind in the conspiracy. Consequently, so long as there was

sufficient evidence (from Saravanan) to show that there had been an abetment by conspiracy

between the appellant and Saravanan, the charge would have been proven. </p>
<p xmlns="">46        In any case, I was of the opinion that an

adverse inference should not be drawn against the prosecution for the failure to call on

Thanabal as a witness. As the Court of Appeal held in <i>Yeo Choon Huat v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=44158&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 217</a>, an adverse inference should only be drawn if it is shown that the prosecution had

withheld certain evidence which it possesses. Here, it was a simple case of Thanabal

having left the jurisdiction prior to the investigations and therefore the police were

unable to obtain statements from him. It was an issue of unavailability rather than

deliberate withholding of evidence. </p>
<p xmlns="">47        Moreover, I was also of the view that if

the appellant considered Thanabal to be a material witness, then the burden lay on him,

and not the prosecution, to call him as a witness. I noted that Thanabal and the appellant

were once colleagues at Heraeus. Surely, if the appellant felt strongly about calling on

Thanabal, it would not have been unreasonable for him to call Thanabal as his witness.

Consequently, I found that the failure of the prosecution to call on Thanabal did not

cause did not materially prejudice the appellant’s case. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Whether the prosecution had proven that the targets had been entrusted

to Saravanan</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">48        Counsel then proceeded to argue that the

prosecution had failed to prove that there was entrustment of the targets to Saravanan.

For this proposition, counsel argued that Saravanan was only one of the assistant

technicians who worked on the machine and that there were other assistant technicians who

came into contact with the targets during the course of their work. Further, he tried to

show, somewhat convolutedly, that after the targets were used in the bomb room, they were

supposed to be kept in the drawers there. Therefore, nobody was specifically entrusted

with the task of collecting the used targets from the bomb room and returning them to the

storeroom, which was where Saravanan had misappropriated the targets. Counsel further

tried to rely on the following passage in Gour’s <i>Penal Law of India</i> (11<sup>th</sup>

ed), Volume IV at p 3957: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Being entrusted with the doing of a job is not the same

    thing as being entrusted with any property within the meaning of s 405 and other cognate

    sections of the Indian Penal Code, even though some money or other property may come into

    the hand of the person in the course of his doing such job. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Counsel tried to show that, even though Saravanan may have been

entrusted with the job, he could not be said to have been entrusted with the targets. </p>
<p xmlns="">49        I found this argument to be completely

without merit. It was convoluted, confusing and wholly unnecessary. The short answer to

counsel’s argument was that Saravanan had already pleaded guilty to a charge under s

408 of the Penal Code and had been sufficiently dealt with by the law. As the prosecution

rightly pointed out, that was the best evidence to show that Saravanan had indeed been

entrusted with the targets which he had misappropriated. Counsel’s allegation that

other assistant technicians were also entrusted with the property, and therefore the

targets could have been misappropriated by them, was yet another baseless allegation for

which he provided no evidence in support. Finally, the distinction between the movement of

the targets between the bomb room and the storeroom at Seagate was extremely superfluous

and was not of any assistance to the appellant. </p>
<p xmlns="">50        In any case, I wish to take this

opportunity to clarify counsel’s attempt at drawing a distinction between entrustment

with the doing of a job and entrustment with property. In <i>Gopalakrishnan Vanitha v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49469&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 307</a>, I recognised and upheld the distinction between entrustment with the doing of a

job and entrustment with property. There, the appellant was a confidential secretary cum

office administrator who was charged with criminal breach of trust by using blank cheques

signed by her boss to make payments to overpay her own salary. I found her letter of

appointment entrusted her with being responsible for petty cash and other relevant

payments but I found that these did not extend to the appellant there becoming entrusted

with the funds of the company. On the facts of that case, I found that the entrustment of

the property came with her boss’s careless act of handing over signed blank cheques

to the appellant and not by virtue of her job as a secretary. </p>
<p xmlns="">51        I was of the opinion that the facts of <i>Gopalakrishnan

Vanitha v PP </i>could<i> </i>be distinguished from the facts of the present case. Here,

Saravanan’s job specifically required him to be entrusted with the targets which he

misappropriated. Therefore the distinction between entrustment of a job and the

entrustment of property did not have any scope for operation on the facts of this case,

because here the entrustment of the former necessarily led to the entrustment of the

latter. Consequently, I rejected counsel’s arguments on this point. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Whether the second charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">52        The appellant’s defence on the second

charge was similar to his defence on the first charge, viz. that he had merely received

the two stolen ‘Tosoh’ targets from Saravanan on the instructions of Ram. For

the reasons similar to those cited above on the first charge, I did not think that there

was much merit in the appellant’s defence vis--vis the second charge. For a charge

under s 411 of the Penal Code, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant had

dishonestly retained the said ‘Tosoh’ targets and that the appellant had reason

to believe that they were stolen. In order to ascertain what is the meaning of

‘reason to believe’, one may refer to s 26 of the Penal Code which states: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">A person is said to have "reason to believe" a

    thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing, but not otherwise.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">53        Here, there was ample evidence from

Saravanan’s statements which implicated the appellant with regard to the two

‘Tosoh’ targets. Moreover, the trial judge found that the appellant was not a

nave person but rather a person who was experienced in this line of business. I saw no

reason to disagree with the trial judge on this point. Further, like a charge under s 109

read with s 408 of the Penal Code, a charge under s 411 does not require the prosecution

to prove that the accused person was the mastermind behind the conspiracy. The fact that

the appellant may or may not have been the mastermind was therefore irrelevant. It is

trite law that an appellate court will not disturb the findings of a trial judge unless

the findings were against the weight of the evidence: see <i>Lim Poh Eng v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a>. On the facts, I saw no reason to disturb the findings of the trial judge in

convicting the appellant on the second charge and therefore, I dismissed his appeal

against conviction on the second charge as well. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal against sentence</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">54        On the appeal against sentence, counsel

submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive on the following grounds: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    The prosecution failed to prove that the value of the property

    involved was US$469,800; </p>
<p>(b)    Saravanan, as the principal offender, was merely sentenced to

    four years’ imprisonment and there was no reason why the appellant should be given a

    substantially heavier sentence than Saravanan; and </p>
<p>(c)    The sentence was manifestly excessive in light of similar cases

    where the accused persons were given lighter sentences even though the amounts involved

    were higher. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Value of the property involved</p>
<p></p></i>55        First, counsel argued that the

sentence should not have been as harsh because the prosecution had not managed to prove

beyond reasonable doubt that 48 targets were involved. Since I found that the charge had

been proven beyond reasonable doubt and had dismissed the appeal against conviction, I saw

no ground for entertaining this contention. 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i>Sentence meted out to accomplice</i></p>
<p xmlns="">56        Secondly, counsel pointed out that

Saravanan, the principal offender, was only sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and

the appellant, being only a secondary offender, should not be given a substantially

heavier sentence than Saravanan. </p>
<p xmlns="">57        This argument was too nave and

simplistic. Admittedly, consistency in sentencing is a desirable goal. However, the fact

remains that each case must be looked at on its own special facts. The sentence meted out

to an accomplice is but one of the myriad of factors that a sentencing court can take into

account for the purposes of sentencing. In <i>PP v Ng Tai Tee Janet &amp; Anor </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=60168&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 1 SLR 343</a>, I was not fettered by the sentence meted out to the accomplice when I was

deciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused persons. There, even though the

accomplice was merely given a fine, I nevertheless sentenced the accused persons to a

custodial sentence. I found that to be appropriate because the accused persons played a

more active role in the syndicate than the accomplice. </p>
<p xmlns="">58        Similarly, on the facts of the present

case, I saw no reason why the trial judge’s sentencing discretion should have been

fettered by the sentence meted out to Saravanan. Here, in the absence of any evidence to

support the appellant’s allegation that Ram was indeed the mastermind, it appeared to

me that it was the appellant himself who was the mastermind of the conspiracy. In that

light, the fact that a harsher sentence was meted out to the appellant was appropriate. It

was also clear from the notes of evidence that the trial judge had taken into account a

whole host of factors, including the other six charges taken into consideration against

the appellant. I found this approach of the trial judge to be correct and accordingly I

saw no reason for me to disturb the sentence on this ground. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Sentence meted out in other criminal breach of trust cases</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">59        Thirdly, counsel diligently brought up a

number of cases which involved criminal breach of trust to show that lighter sentences

were imposed in those cases, even though the amounts involved were higher. While I

congratulated counsel for his diligence in bringing up those cases, the short answer to

this argument of his could be found in my judgment in <i>Soong Hee Sin v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61084&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 2 SLR 253</a>. There, I observed: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">With respect, I

    found counsel’s attempt to reduce the law of sentencing into a rigid and inflexible

    mathematical formula in which all sentences are deemed capable of being tabulated with

    absolute scientific precision to be highly unrealistic. If the appropriate sentence in

    each case was indeed nothing more than a computation of numbers and figures, then judges

    are better off delegating the task of sentencing to their secretaries and clerks who I

    venture to think are possibly more adept at these things than judges. In my view, the

    regime of sentencing is a matter of law which involves a hotchpotch of such varied and

    manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely identical in this regard. While

    past cases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the

    sentencing court, that is also all that they are, i.e. mere guidelines only. This is

    especially so with regard to the unreported cases, in which the detailed facts and

    circumstances are hardly, if ever, disclosed with sufficient clarity to enable any

    intelligent comparison to be made. At the end of the day, every case which comes before

    the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own

    circumstances, and counsel be kept constantly and keenly apprised of the fact that it is

    just not possible to categorise cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">60        I found counsel’s attempt in drawing

from other similar cases to be a similar attempt in reducing the law of sentencing into a

rigid and inflexible mathematical formula. I take this opportunity to reiterate that in

sentencing accused persons on charges of criminal breach of trust, the court’s

discretion is never restricted by the amount involved. Each case must be looked at on its

own facts. While guidelines and benchmark sentences do give some aid to ensure consistency

in sentencing, the value of the property cannot, and will never, be the sole factor in

determining the sentence. To do so would constrain the judges’ ability to give effect

to the four general principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation

when passing out a sentence: see <i>Chua Tiong Tiong v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61827&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 3 SLR 425</a>, <i>PP v

<i xmlns=""><b>
