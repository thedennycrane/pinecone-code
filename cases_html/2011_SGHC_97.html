<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These are two appeals against the decisions of
                    the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) in Originating Summons No 1197 of
                    2010 (“OS 1197”) and SUM 5515 of 2010 (“SUM
                    5515”), where Hau Tau Thong (“the appellant”) applied, as
                    director, to enforce the right to inspect the company’s accounts pursuant
                    to s 199(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“CA”) (the “right to inspect”) and for specific
                    discovery of the company’s accounts under O 24 r 5 of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                    Court”) respectively. The applications, initiated as alternatives to each
                    other, were both dismissed by the AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Central to both appeals are the issues whether
                    there are any restrictions on the right to inspect and if so, what these are.
                    The appellant readily accepted that he was exercising the right to inspect so as
                    to defend against an intended derivative action instituted by another director,
                    Hau Tau Khang (“the respondent”), for alleged breaches of
                    fiduciary duties arising from the company’s accounts. In the
                    respondent’s view, this was an exercise of the right to inspect for an
                    improper purpose, an exception following, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the decision of <em>Oxford Legal Group Ltd v
                        Sibbasbridge Services plc and anor</em>
                    [2008] EWCA Civ 387 (“<em>Oxford
                        Legal</em>”). He contended that the purpose of the right to
                    inspect was for discharge of <em>present or
                        prospective</em> director’s duties pertaining to the company
                    accounts or at least director’s duties in general. In view of this, it
                    would also be improper to use the right to justify the past conduct/performance
                    of director’s duties. Lastly, he claimed the appellant was attempting to
                    use the right to inspect to subvert the discovery process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant and the respondent are
                    co-directors with equal shareholdings in the companies, Sanur Indonesian
                    Restaurant Pte Ltd (“SIRPL”) and Sanur Holding Pte Ltd
                    (“SHPL”) (collectively referred to as “the
                    Companies”). The Companies were engaged in the business of running a
                    chain of restaurants serving Indonesian cuisine under the trade name of
                        “<em>Sanur</em>”. At all material times,
                    the appellant, as the elder brother, was the managing director overseeing the
                    business operations of the Companies though both the appellant and the
                    respondent were co-signatories of all the Companies’ bank
                accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in 2003, the relationship between the
                    brothers began to deteriorate. In 2006, they entered into an agreement to keep
                    the restaurants in operation with a view to selling the business and the
                    properties of the Companies and eventually of an orderly winding up of the
                    Companies (“the 2006 Agreement”). Both sides later accused the
                    other of unreasonable behaviour in managing the winding down process.
                    Specifically, the respondent claimed the appellant deliberately allowed the
                    offer for renewal of the lease for their flagship restaurant at Ngee Ann City to
                    lapse. The respondent also discovered some irregularities in SIRPL’s
                    accounts but when he sought an explanation from the appellant, the latter was
                    allegedly evasive. By 2009, all the <em>Sanur</em>
                    restaurants had ceased operations, though both brothers remained as directors of
                    the Companies. In October 2009, the appellant and his wife started another
                    Indonesian restaurant, <em>Pepes</em>, at the same location
                    at Ngee Ann City.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondent claimed that while investigating
                    into the affairs of the Companies, he was stonewalled by Ms Cecilia Tan,
                    the Office Manager. The respondent then terminated the services of Ms Tan
                    in September 2009 and took possession of the keys to the Companies’
                    documentation cabinets. There is some dispute over the manner and circumstances
                    under which he came to acquire possession of the keys. However, that is not
                    strictly relevant for the purposes of the appeals. Having had access to the
                    Companies’ accounts, the respondent apparently discovered that the cash
                    deposits did not match the daily cash sales of the restaurants. Unknown to the
                    appellant, the respondent then engaged the services of Stone Forest Corporate
                    Advisory Pte Ltd (“Stone Forest”) to conduct a forensic
                    examination of the accounts of the Companies so as to investigate the alleged
                    cash discrepancies. Thereafter, a report was issued by Stone Forest
                    (“Stone Forest Report”) in which it was reported that
                    “based on the monthly sales summary for all 3 restaurants, the total
                    amount of cash sales not deposited into Sanur’s bank accounts amounted to
                    S$153,525.45”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In August 2010, the respondent applied for leave
                    of court to commence a derivative action on behalf of the Companies against the
                    appellant for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties pursuant to Originating
                    Summons No 879 of 2010 (“OS 879”). The breaches alleged against
                    the appellant included financial irregularities in SIRPL’s accounts based
                    on the Stone Forest Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In response to OS 879, the appellant instituted
                    a separate application in OS 1197 pursuant to s 199(3) of the CA to
                    exercise his right as a director to inspect SIRPL’s accounts. In the
                    alternative, the appellant made a second application vide SUM 5515 in OS 879,
                    for specific discovery of the Companies’ accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Assistant Registrar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before the learned AR, the appellant accepted
                    that his motivation behind both applications was to gain access to the
                    Companies’ accounts in order to prove his defence in OS 879 and exonerate
                    himself from the allegation of financial irregularities and/or breaches of
                    fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The AR agreed with the respondent’s
                    submission that the right to inspect under s 199(3) was restricted to
                    enabling a director to carry out his duties. As she found that the application
                    was intended to seek “ammunition” to defend the appellant against
                    the potential derivative action, she dismissed the application. As for
                    SUM 5515, the AR found that the application was premature given that leave
                    had not been granted for the commencement of OS 879.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The appellant appealed against both decisions.
                    Before me, parties agreed that if the appellant succeeded in his appeal in
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 492 of 2010 (“RA 492”) against the
                    AR’s decision to dismiss the application under s 199(3) of the CA,
                    there was no need to deal with Registrar’s Appeal No 491 of 2010
                    (“RA 491”) as it involved the same set of
                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appeals concern the following documents
                    (collectively referred to as “the Companies’
                    accounts”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The accounting and other records of
                        the Companies that sufficiently explained the transactions and financial
                        position of the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Transaction records of SIRPL’s DBS cheque book for
                        the period 1 July 2006 till end November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Daily cash deposit slips for
                        SIRPL’s outlet at Causeway Point for the period 1 July 2006 to
                        March 2009 and for the period 1 July 2006 to September 2009 for the
                        Centrepoint outlet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before embarking on an examination of the
                    substantive merits of the appeals, I believe it is helpful to begin my analysis
                    by considering the relevant principles applicable to the right of inspection
                    under s 199(3) of the CA. It should be noted that the exercise of the right
                    of inspection, unlike an application for specific discovery under O 24
                    r 5, does not require the director to establish either relevance or
                    necessity. Therein lies the critical difference in these two “<em>discovery</em>” regimes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The origin and nature of the right to inspect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     An appropriate starting point will be to
                    consider the precise terms of s 199 of the CA which states, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Accounting records and systems of
                        control</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Every company and the directors and managers thereof shall cause to be
                        kept such accounting and other records as will sufficiently explain the
                        transactions and financial position of the company and enable true and fair
                        profit and loss accounts and balance-sheets and any documents required to be
                        attached thereto to be prepared from time to time, and shall cause those
                        records to be kept in such manner as to enable them to be conveniently and
                        properly audited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The records referred to in subsection (1) shall be kept at the
                        registered office of the company or at such other place as the directors
                        think fit and <b><em>shall at all times be open to inspection
                            by the directors</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) If accounting and other records are kept by the company at a place
                        outside Singapore there shall be sent to and kept at a place in Singapore
                        and be at all times open to inspection by the directors such statements and
                        returns with respect to the business dealt with in the records so kept as
                        will enable to be prepared true and fair profit and loss accounts and
                        balance-sheets and any documents required to be attached thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) The Court may in any particular case order that the accounting and
                        other records of a company be open to inspection by a public accountant
                        acting for a director, but only upon an undertaking in writing given to the
                        Court that information acquired by the public accountant during his
                        inspection shall not be disclosed by him except to that director. (6) If
                        default is made in complying with this section, the company and every
                        officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence and
                        shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to
                        imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months and also to a default
                        penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From the wording, it is immediately apparent
                    that s 199(3) of the CA is couched in mandatory terms. This was observed by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Wuu Khek Chiang
                        George v ECRC Land Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 352 (“<em>George
                    Wuu</em>”) at [25]. Less
                    obvious is the origin of this right. Over the years, many judges have disagreed
                    on this including, Slade J in <em>Conway v Petronius
                        Clothing Co Ltd</em> [1978] 1 All ER 185
                        (“<em>Conway</em>”) who was a proponent
                    of the view that the right was conferred at common law (see 201), and
                    Mahon J in the New Zealand decision of <em>Berlei Hestia
                        (NZ) Ltd v Fernyhough</em> [1980] 2 NZLR 150
                        (“<em>Berlei</em>”) who declared the
                    right was a creature of statute (see 163). However, in <em>George
                        Wuu</em>, the Court of Appeal observed that it was immaterial whether
                    the right owed its origin to common law or statute when it approved Kan
                    JC’s holding (as he then was) in <em>Welch and anor v
                        Britannia Industries Pte Ltd</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 64
                        (“<em>Welch</em>”) at [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is nothing in s 199 or elsewhere in the [Companies] Act that
                        suggests that the common law rule reflected in <em>Edman v
                            Ross</em>...is modified. The provision should therefore be read in
                        conformity with <em>Edman v Ross</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It appears to me that implicit in the Court of Appeal’s decision
                    is the acceptance that the right was <em>initially</em>
                    conferred at common law and <em>thereafter</em> remained
                    unmodified by legislation. It is at least clear that the Court of Appeal treated
                    the rights under common law as co-extensive with the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Next, the right to inspect has been described
                    in various terms such as “an absolute right” in <em>Welch</em> at [29], <em>George Wuu</em> at [33] and “unqualified” in <em>Berlei</em> at 163. Whatever the nomenclature used to describe this
                    right, the following principles appear from the decided cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The right to inspect the
                        company’s accounts flows from the office of the director. Accordingly,
                        that right cannot be exercised once he or she ceases to be a director:
                            <em>Conway</em> at 201, <em>State of
                            South Australia &amp; Anor v Barrett &amp; Ors</em> (1995)
                        64 SASR 73 (“<em>Barrett</em>”)
                        at 76. The rationale is that an ex-director “has no proprietary,
                        managerial or other similar interest in the accounting and other records of
                        a company” (see <em>Haw Par Bros (Pte) Ltd v Dato Aw
                            Kow</em> [1971–1973] SLR(R) 813 at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     There is strictly no necessity for the director
                        to furnish reasons or justify himself before he can exercise his right to
                        inspect. This is clear from the facts of <em>George
                            Wuu</em>. At the time the application for enforcement of the right
                        to inspect was made, there were various disputes between the applicant
                        director, the respondent company and its joint venture partner over the
                        leasehold interest in two plots of land leased from the Land Office and
                        certain payments which were made in relation to the assignment of the lease.
                        There was initially some ambiguity as to the capacity in which the request
                        for inspection was made. The right was denied and the director applied to
                        court to enforce his right of inspection. At first instance, the court
                        dismissed the director’s application principally because he had
                        written to the Commissioner of Land advising revocation of consent to the
                        assignment of the lease in view that the respondent company had committed
                        several serious breaches of the lease agreement and the joint venture had
                        reached a stalemate (“the Letter”). On the strength of the
                        Letter, the court held that the respondent company was justified in
                        harbouring doubts about the <em>bona fides</em> of the
                        application. The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed. In their view, the
                        judge below had erred by placing too much emphasis on the Letter as evidence
                        of <em>mala fides</em>. Instead, on the premise that
                        the director had an absolute right to inspect the accounts, it allowed the
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The significance of this decision lies in the fact that
                        the applicant director did not have to state his reasons for the request to
                        inspect. This ties in neatly with the decisions in <em>Edman
                            v Ross</em> [1922] 2 SR (NSW) 351
                            (“<em>Edman</em>”) at 361 and
                            <em>Welch</em> at [29], where it was observed that a director is not required
                        to furnish any reason to inspect the company’s accounts in the first
                        place. This principle was applied recently by Pillai JC (as he then was) in
                            <em>Ng Joo Soon (alias Nga Ju Soon) v Dovechem Holdings
                            Pte Ltd and another suit</em> [2011] 1 SLR 1155 at
                            [37].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the absence of proof to the
                        contrary, the court would assume that the right would be exercised for the
                        benefit of the company: <em>Edman</em> at 361 and
                            <em>Welch</em> at [29].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     In exercising the right of inspection, the director can engage
                        external assistance, for instance in the form of an accountant: <em>Edman</em> at 361–362.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     The right to inspect will be lost where it is
                        exercised for some ulterior purpose <em>or</em> to
                        injure the company. This was expressed in clear terms by the Court of Appeal
                        in <em>George Wuu</em> at [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">33    The right of a director to inspect the books
                                and records of the company flows from his office as a director and
                                enables him to perform his duties as a director, including the duty
                                to ensure that the company complies with the requirements as to
                                accounts set out in the Companies Act: see s 204(1) of the Act. Such
                                right is an important one, as the books and records of a company are
                                a primary, and sometimes the only, source of information as to the
                                state of affairs of a company. It follows that unless a director has
                                access to these sources of information, he would be severely
                                inhibited in the proper performance of his duties. So long,
                                therefore, as such right is exercised for that purpose and not with
                                a view to causing any detriment to the company, the right to inspect
                                is "absolute". In this sense and to that extent, the right may be
                                termed "absolute". <b><em>The corollary of this is that
                                    the right will be lost where it is exercised not to advance the

                                    injure the company</em></b><em>: Edman v

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">It bears noting at this point that the Court of Appeal did not
                        define what constitutes an “ulterior purpose”. This became the
                        pivotal issue for determination in the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_f"></a>(f)     Where the right of inspection has been
                        disallowed, the denial is not a function of the court’s residual
                        discretion but rather an outcome arising from the court’s decision
                        that the right was to be exercised in aid of some ulterior or illegitimate
                        purpose (see <em>Berlei</em> at 163 which was cited
                        with approval in <em>George Wuu</em> at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In the course of his judgment Slade J relied to a considerable
                            extent, with reference to the extent of the director's rights, upon the
                            quotations just made from the two reported cases referred to, but I
                            venture to suggest, with great respect, that <b><em>neither
                                of the cases in fact justifies the conclusion of Slade J that there
                                is a discretion as to whether or not a Court will permit a director
                                to have access to corporate records and accounts. The correct
                                construction of the authorities relied upon by Slade J seems to me
                                to be that the right of inspection is unqualified, but that where it
                                is proved that a director is acting or is about to act in breach of
                                his fiduciary duty to the company and intends to aid that process by
                                inspecting the books, then his right to inspection
                                disappears</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">It is noteworthy that <em>Oxford Legal</em>
                        holds a contrary view at [12] that
                        the court has a residual discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in the appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The upshot of the principles listed above
                        (<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> <em>supra</em>) is that a director’s right to
                    inspect, though described as “<em>absolute</em>”, is subject to certain limitations. As both counsel
                    rightly appreciated, the issue in dispute was thus whether the appellant’s
                    disclosed purpose (<em>viz</em> exercise of the right to
                    prove that he had not in fact committed any breaches of fiduciary duties) fell
                    within the scope of these restrictions so as to oust the appellant’s
                    otherwise “absolute” right to inspect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Counsel for the respondent, Mr Adrian
                    Wong submitted that the appellant’s “absolute” right to
                    inspect the company accounts was subject to the following parameters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The right had to be exercised for
                        performance of director’s duties pertaining to the accounts of the
                        company.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        right had to be exercised in relation to performance of a director’s
                        present and future duties. It could not be used to justify past
                        conduct/performance of director’s duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The exercise of the right for any other purpose
                        not pertaining to discharge of a director’s duties generally was
                        “improper” and would therefore displace the
                        “absolute” right of inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Counsel for the appellant, Mr Tony Yeo
                    adopted the more traditional view that, short of proof that the exercise would
                    be injurious to the Companies, the appellant’s “absolute”
                    right of inspection could not be denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I will now turn to each of the
                    respondent’s contentions and examine them in closer detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Must the right to inspect be strictly exercised in relation to
                director’s duties pertaining to the company accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Wong’s first submission was that
                    the right to inspect was conferred strictly to enable a director to fulfil his
                    statutory duties in relation to the Companies’ accounts, for instance in
                    the preparation of “true and fair profit and loss accounts”
                    pursuant to s 201(3) of the CA. Any other unrelated purpose was, by
                    definition, an improper purpose. In support of this narrow interpretation,
                    Mr Wong directed me to the placement of s 199(3) within Part IV of the
                    CA which governed “Accounts and Audit”. With this restricted
                    purpose in mind, he argued that the appeal in RA 492 simply could not succeed
                    given the declared purpose of the appellant’s intended
                inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As palatable as the respondent’s
                    argument may appear, I note that there is nothing in s 199 that suggests
                    that the right of inspection should be so restricted. In fact, in <em>George Wuu</em> (see [14(e)] <em>supra</em>), the Court of Appeal specifically held that the right was
                    to enable the director to perform his duties, <em>including</em> the duty to ensure that the company complies with the
                    requirements as to accounts. It went on to observe at [25] that the right is “a <em>concomitant</em> of the fiduciary duties of good faith, care,
                    skill and diligence which a director owes to the company”. In the earlier
                    English case of <em>Conway</em>, Slade J similarly
                    pointed out that “the right to inspect documents and, if necessary, to
                    take copies of them is essential to the proper performance of a director’s
                    duties...” without stipulating which duties he meant. It bears noting
                    that even under the leading authority relied on by the respondent (<em>viz Oxford Legal</em>) a director can exercise the right to
                    inspect for the purposes of carrying out his duties as a director <em>generally</em> (see <em>Oxford
                        Legal</em> at [37]). This
                    interpretation is supported by the later comment in the same paragraph in
                        <em>Oxford Legal</em> that it was inconsistent for the
                    court to, on the one hand, hold a director at risk of liability for breach of
                    his duties and, on the other hand, refuse to enforce the right of inspection
                        <em>by the exercise of which the director could take steps to
                        avoid liability for breach of those duties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In light of the above considerations, I reject
                    the respondent’s narrow construction of the purpose of the right to
                    inspect and find that inspection was intended to enable a director to discharge
                        <em>all</em> his statutory duties, including but not
                    limited to those in relation to accounts. It appears quite foreseeable to me
                    that a director might need to check the company’s accounts so as to
                    discharge his duties of reasonable care and diligence pursuant to s 157(1)
                    of the CA. This was precisely what Rodgers J in <em>Law Wai
                        Duen v Boldwin Construction Co Ltd</em> [2001] HKCA 284
                        (“<em>Law Wai Duen</em>”) was alluding to
                    at [12] when he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hence, in relation to many matters directors will no doubt rely upon what
                        is done by company officials and their fellow directors in relation to the
                        affairs of a company. But that is not the say that the ultimate
                        responsibility does not lie upon the director. If a director has cause to be
                        suspicious, or reasonably believes there is such cause, then the director
                        may incur liability if he does not satisfy himself in relation to <em>all matters</em> relating to the company’s affairs.
                        More importantly, even if a director does rely upon other directors or
                        company officials in the conduct of the company’s affairs, he must, at
                        all times, be at liberty to satisfy himself as to <em>any
                            matter</em> in relation to the company’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, a director might also need to check the company’s
                    accounts to discharge his duty to act in the interest of the company as, without
                    information on the company’s financial position, the director may not be
                    able to exercise his discretion properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the circumstances, a wider purpose is, in
                    my view, entirely consistent with the right of the director to inspect the
                    company’s accounts as such a right is but a “legal incident of his
                    directorship” (see <em>Molomby v Whitehead and Australian
                        Broadcasting Corporation</em> [1985] 63 A.L.R.282
                        (“<em>Molomby</em>”) at
                293).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the right restricted to performance of present and future
                duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The appellant submitted that there was no
                    logical reason why the right should be restricted to the discharge of a
                    director’s present and future duties. Instead the criterion should be
                    whether the intended inspection bore any <em>nexus</em> to
                    the performance of any duty as a director – past, present and future. In
                    support of this, Mr Yeo drew my attention to the case of <em>McDougall v On Q Group Ltd</em> [2007] VSC 184
                        (“<em>McDougall</em>”), where the right
                    of inspection was invoked in relation to a past event, <em>ie</em> a loan that was extended some time ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>McDougall</em>,
                    the quantum of a loan pursuant to a loan agreement was subject to revision
                    following audit of the company’s accounts. The plaintiff director felt
                    that he had grounds to believe that the accounts were irregular, and for this
                    purpose sought to exercise his right to inspect the company’s accounts but
                    was prevented by the board of directors from doing so. The company subsequently
                    brought legal proceedings against him for recovery of the outstanding loan
                    amount. In response, he applied to court to enforce his right to inspect and
                    succeeded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Wong sought to distinguish <em>McDougall</em> on two grounds. First, the court enforced the
                    right to inspect because the director had acted early enough. He had sought
                    inspection before commencement of legal proceedings against him but had been
                    stonewalled by the board of directors from making further investigations. In
                    contrast, once legal proceedings had been instituted, his interest to prove that
                    the quantum was excessive would necessarily oppose the company’s interest
                    to ensure that the amount did not diminish. Secondly, though the
                    director’s purpose was to defend himself against a claim brought by the
                    company, he had other legitimate reasons for the inspection, <em>ie</em> to establish irregularities in the administration of the
                    company’s accounts. This was in stark contrast to the appellant who
                    admitted that his sole purpose of inspection was to prove his defence against
                    the allegations of financial irregularities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As regards Mr Wong’s first
                    argument, I am not convinced that the timing of the application or request to
                    inspect the accounts is particularly relevant, as long as the applicant is still
                    a director at the material time. Mr Wong’s second argument also fails
                    to consider the observation in <em>McDougall</em> at
                        [30] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“…the mere fact that a director requires access to company
                        documents to defend a claim by the company against the director does not, by
                        itself, establish that the director requires access for an impermissible
                        private purpose. In this case, <b><em>it is just as much in the
                            company’s interests, as it is in Mr McDougall’s
                            personal interests, that the dispute concerning his indebtedness to the
                            company is resolved, on proper grounds, as soon as
                        possible</em></b>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This, I believe, was the crux behind the court’s decision to
                    allow the application in <em>McDougall</em>. Similarly, in
                    the present appeals, the appellant submitted that it was in the Companies’
                    interest to allow him to inspect the accounts because if the accounts proved
                    that he had not breached his fiduciary duties, the Companies’ limited
                    resources would not be squandered on futile litigation. I agree. There appears
                    to be no principled reason why a company’s accounts cannot be inspected to
                    answer allegations against a director in respect of alleged misconduct in the
                    performance of his duties as a director. The accounts are documents belonging to
                        <em>the Companies</em>. The respondent should thus have
                    no greater right to the accounts than the appellant since they are <em>both</em> existing directors of the Companies with equal
                    rights to the Companies’ documents. As such, I find that the respondent
                    was not entitled to restrict discovery to selective documents relied on and
                    referred to in the Stone Forest Report. It is common ground that such documents
                    do not represent the complete set of the Companies’ accounting documents.
                    The respondent should not be able to pick and choose the documents for
                    inspection as surely, the right to decide cannot be determined by his fortuitous
                    possession of the keys to the documentation cabinet. In the words of
                    Beaumont J in <em>Molomby</em> at 293, the respondent
                    had “wrongly assumed the role of arbiter of [the plaintiff
                    director’s right to inspect]” which was “a matter of legal
                    right vested in [him]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     To further justify his narrow interpretation,
                    Mr Wong also relied on the decision in <em>Barrett</em> where it was stated at [82] that the right to inspect is
                    “restricted to directors acting in that capacity and for the purposes of
                    the corporation as distinct from private and personal reasons”. In his
                    view, this stood for the proposition that a director’s use of the right to
                    inspect to account for past conduct constituted a “personal”
                    purpose that would be “improper”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I do not agree with the respondent’s
                    interpretation of <em>Barrett</em>. In that case, the
                    parties seeking to enforce the right of inspection were <em>former</em> directors, unlike the appellant in the present appeals.
                    Upon termination of their tenure as directors, the defendants in <em>Barrett</em> no longer had duties in relation to the company
                    for which the right could be enforced. It was in those circumstances that the
                    right was described as being exercised in their “<em>personal capacities</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The respondent’s final argument lay in
                    his assertion that the positions of an ex-director and a director of a dormant
                    company were analogous as both no longer owed <em>present</em> or <em>future</em> duties in
                    relation to the Companies’ accounts. There is, however, one significant
                    difference which lies in the fact that a director of a dormant company remains
                    liable as a director with statutory duties. For discharge of those duties, he
                    must continue to hold the right to inspect as recognised in <em>Re Carry Strong Dyeing Factory Ltd</em> [2007] HKEC 1140
                        (“<em>Re Carry Strong</em>”). I also note
                    that in <em>Re Carry Strong</em>, the Hong Kong court did
                    not consider relevant the fact that the company had ceased business some three
                    years prior to the application to enforce the right of inspection. This
                    reinforces my view that the right of inspection is not in any way curtailed by
                    the dormant or inactive nature of any company as long as the applicant is still
                    a director of the company at the time of the application. There is, therefore,
                    no convincing reason to confine the right of inspection to the performance of
                    present and future duties as a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Can the right to inspect be exercised for purposes wholly unconnected
                to discharge of a director’s duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before dealing with the respondent’s
                    last argument, it is helpful for me to examine in greater detail the existing
                    restrictions articulated in case law, the most established of which arises in a
                    situation where a director exercises the right to inspect “with a view to
                    causing any detriment to the company” thereby “abusing the
                    confidence reposed in him” (see <em>George Wuu</em>
                    at [32]). Observations of similar tenor
                    were made in <em>Welch</em> at [32] – if his intentions were “<em>materially to injure the company</em>” and in <em>McDougall</em> at [7],
                    if there is “clear proof that a misuse of power is involved (the onus of
                    which lies on those asserting it)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     What is less clear from the decided cases is
                    whether the restriction extends beyond that, <em>ie</em>
                    does refusal of the right to inspect when it would cause injury or detriment to
                    the company operate as the <em>only</em> restraint to the
                    otherwise absolute right of inspection? The respondent argued in the negative
                    and in support, referred this court to the decision of <em>Oxford
                        Legal</em> at [34] where the
                    English Court of Appeal analysed <em>George Wuu</em> in
                    close detail:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
            [34] In <em>Wuu Khek Chiang George v ECRC Land Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                        3 SLR 65 at [32] the Singapore
                        Court of Appeal referred to the director being refused inspection when the
                        court was satisfied 'that the intention of the director in inspecting the
                        books and records is to make use of the information for ulterior purposes
                        such as with a view to causing detriment to the company'. The court said
                        this (at [33]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
              [33] The right of a director
                            to inspect the books and records of the company flows from his office as
                            a director and enables him to perform his duties as a director ... Such
                            a right is an important one, as the books and records of a company are a
                            primary, and sometimes the only, source of information as to the state
                            of affairs of a company. It follows that unless a director has access to
                            these sources of information he would be severely inhibited in the
                            proper performance of his duties. So long, therefore, as such right is
                            exercised for that purpose and not with a view to causing detriment to
                            the company, the right to inspect is 'absolute'. In this sense and to
                            that extent, the right may be termed 'absolute'. The corollary of this
                            is that the right will be lost where it is exercised not to advance the
                            interests of the company but for some ulterior purpose or to injure the
                            company: Edman v Ross (supra) at p 361, <em>Molomby v
                                Whitehead</em> (supra) at p 292.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And the court went on to say (at para [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is for those who oppose the director's right to inspect to show
                            "clear proof" and to satisfy the court "affirmatively" that the grant of
                            the right of inspection would be for a purpose which would be
                            detrimental to the interests of the company. There must be a "real
                            ground" that the right would be abused and that substantial harm would
                            be caused to the company thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant, of course, relies on that final passage. But, when read in
                        conjunction with the earlier passages which I have cited, it is, I think,
                        reasonably clear that the court did not intend a distinction between 'some
                        ulterior purpose' (not involving injury to the company) and 'a purpose which
                        would be detrimental to the interests of the company'. The true distinction
                        is that drawn in its judgment (at para [33]): a distinction between the director's exercise of the
                        right 'in the proper performance of his duties' and his exercise of the
                        right 'not to advance the interests of the company but for some ulterior
                        purpose'. <b><em>Properly understood, as it seems to me, the
                            decision in Wuu Khek Chiang George v ECRC Land Pte Ltd does not support
                            the proposition that the circumstances in which the court will refuse to
                            enforce the right to inspect are confined to those in which the purpose
                            for which the director sought inspection is to injure the
                            company</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Looking at Rodgers J’s judgment in
                        <em>Law Wai Duen</em>, the Court of Appeal in <em>Oxford Legal</em> also held at [37] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>I find it difficult to think that [Rogers J] intended
                            to hold that a court would be required to enforce the right in
                            circumstances in which it was demonstrated that the director was seeking
                            inspection for some other improper purpose (not involving injury to the
                            company)</em></b>. First it was unnecessary, in that case, to make a
                        distinction between intention to injure the company and other improper
                        purpose...Second, as I have said, I am not persuaded that there is support
                        for that proposition in the judgment of Street CJ in <em>Edman v Ross</em> or in the judgment of Slade J in <em>Conway v Petronius</em>, to both of which Rodgers J
                        referred with approval. Third, as it seems to me, that proposition would be
                        inconsistent with his own analysis of the reason why the court ought not to
                        refuse to enforce the right inspection: if the director was seeking to
                        exercise that right, not for the purpose for which it was conferred but for
                        some purpose unconnected with his duties as a director, there was no reason
                        why inspection should not be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Having reviewed the authorities mentioned in
                        [34] and [37] of <em>Oxford
                        Legal</em>, I agree with Sir John Chadwick that “properly
                    understood”, <em>George Wuu</em> and <em>Law Wai Duen</em> did not confine the circumstances under
                    which a court would refuse inspection to situations where the exercise of the
                    right would injure the company. I also accept Mr Wong’s submission
                    that the exception to the right to inspect cannot be restricted only to
                    instances where the exercise would be “injurious” or
                    “detrimental” to the company. Obviously if it is
                    “injurious” to the company, it would <em>ipso
                        facto</em> amount to an “improper” purpose. But the
                    right to inspect can also be displaced if the director intends to use it for any
                    purposes unconnected to the discharge of his director’s duties. This
                    reasoning is consistent with case law and with my finding at [22] (<em>supra</em>)
                    that the right to inspect was conferred on directors (whether at common law or
                    by statute or both) to facilitate the discharge of all director’s duties
                    in the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The next issue in contention is where the
                    burden of proof lies. On the authority of <em>George
                        Wuu</em> at [34], it appears
                    to me that the burden squarely lies on the party opposing the right, whatever
                    the exception may be:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    The onus of establishing that the right is being,
                            or will be, exercised for an improper purpose lies on the person who

                            this will ordinarily be assumed: see <em>Molomby v

                                for the purpose which would be detrimental to the interests of the
                                company</em></b>. There must be a "real ground" that the right
                            would be abused and that substantial harm would be caused to the company
                            thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unless this burden is discharged to the satisfaction of the courts, it
                    must be assumed that the director will exercise the right for the benefit of the
                    company (see <em>Edman</em> at 163). In other words, the
                    default position is that a director is entitled <em>as of
                        right</em> to have access to the company’s accounts and other
                    corporate information unless it can be demonstrated that an exception applies.
                    The threshold is a high one, as demonstrated in <em>Campbell v
                        Jervois Mining Limted</em> [2009] FCA 316. Here, the
                    plaintiff director admitted that the purpose for which he sought access to the
                    company records was for the lobbying of shareholders who had given proxies.
                    Despite that, the court nevertheless held that the plaintiff director was
                    entitled to inspect all the records of the company and the purpose identified
                    for the inspection would not “abuse the confidence reposed in him”
                    or materially injure the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Now, although it was not necessary for the
                    appellant to provide reasons for the exercise of his right to inspect, he openly
                    stated on record that his purpose was to address the allegations of breaches of
                    fiduciary duties in relation to the Companies’ accounts in OS 879. The
                    question whether such a purpose is “injurious” to the interest of
                    the Companies or unrelated to the performance of director’s duties
                    therefore arose. In this regard, the respondent argued that the factual matrix
                    in the present case bore many similarities to <em>Oxford
                        Legal</em>, where the English Court of Appeal found that the right to
                    inspect was exercised for an ulterior purpose. With this in mind, I will now
                    examine whether there is any material distinction between <em>Oxford Legal</em> and the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Distinguishing Oxford Legal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As a starting point, it is helpful to note the
                    facts of <em>Oxford Legal</em> in some detail. The
                    appellant company (“OLG”) and one Mr Hoyer Millar
                    (“HM”) were director-shareholders of the respondent company
                    (“SBS”). OLG was controlled by one Mr Kenneth Brooks
                    (“Mr Brooks”) through companies he owned. In 2005, HM
                    presented a petition under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 claiming that
                    Mr Brooks’ actions had caused him unfair prejudice as a shareholder.
                    A court order was issued, requiring OLG to sell its shareholding in SBS to HM.
                    The only outstanding issue was for the share price to be determined. This was to
                    be done at a later date, after establishing SBS’s net asset value as at
                    30 September 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In 2007, OLG applied to the court seeking
                    inspection of the SBS accounts from 2002. The Court of Appeal refused inspection
                    on the ground that the right was being exercised for an “improper
                    purpose”. In doing so, it accepted the trial judge’s inference that
                    Mr Brooks (through OLG) was applying the right to fish for evidence that HM
                    had made wrongful payments out of SBS, causing the company’s share value
                    to depreciate. This would allow him to charge HM a higher price for the SBS
                    shares. Unlike a specific discovery application under O 24 r 5 of the Rules
                    of Court, there was no requirement for the director to establish either
                    relevance or necessity to exercise his right of inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There were four factors that the trial judge
                    considered in drawing such an inference:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     The fact that Mr Brooks was, in
                        substance, synonymous with OLG.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The reasons furnished by OLG for wanting to inspect the
                        company documents mirrored the allegations of impropriety raised in the
                        amended defence by Mr Brooks in the earlier s 459
                    petition.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     OLG had
                        inspected, or been offered inspection of all documents required for
                        completing and approving SBS’s financial statements for the period
                        between 30 September 2005 and 30 September 2006 pursuant to the
                        discovery regime under the s 459 petition to enable OLG to deal with
                        the accounts for the year ending 30 September 2006. Nonetheless, OLG
                        still wanted to inspect all the company records since
                    2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     OLG had
                        remained a director only because of Mr Brooks’ action in delaying
                        the valuation of SBS’s shares. Upon sale of its shares, OLG would have
                        ceased to hold its post as director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The respondent relied upon <em>Oxford Legal</em> and argued that an improper purpose necessarily
                    arose when the right to inspect was exercised with the intention of subverting
                    the discovery process as it bore no relation to the discharge of
                    director’s duties. This was precisely the appellant’s intention in
                    instituting OS 1197 whilst the derivative action (<em>viz</em> OS 879) was still at the leave stage. The respondent
                    contended that if the appellant wanted access to the accounts, he would have to
                    wait until discovery was ordered at a later stage instead of trying to
                    “usurp the function of the discovery process”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The respondent’s argument, though
                    convincing, does not recognise two important differences between the factual
                    matrices in <em>Oxford Legal</em> and the present appeals.
                    First, it appears to me that part of the English Court of Appeal’s
                    reasoning in finding an improper purpose arose because OLG was not exercising
                    the right in furtherance of its obligations as a director. Rather, the
                    application was intended to safeguard Mr Brooks’ interest <em>qua</em> shareholder by facilitating a better valuation of
                    his shares. In fact, OLG would not have remained a director if not for its
                    refusal to acknowledge the court order and agree to a sensible valuation of the
                    SBS’s shares. The trial judge himself considered this when he observed at
                        [15] there was a “serious
                    case that OLG was not pursuing these proceedings through any genuine concern
                    that it was necessary or appropriate to do so in order to discharge its
                    obligations as a director”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Second and more significantly, the appellant
                    in the present appeal does not face any restriction in the discovery disclosure
                    as Mr Brooks did in <em>Oxford Legal</em>. Whilst the
                    English Court of Appeal found that Mr Brooks would not have been given the
                    documents he sought as he was unable to fulfil the discovery threshold of
                    relevance and necessity, the appellant in this appeal would be entitled to the
                    Companies’ accounts at the discovery stage of the proceedings in any
                    event. The appellant’s rationale in making this application now instead of
                    waiting to address the matters at trial was to “nip the problem in the
                    bud”. Parties would thus save on time, costs and resources certainly
                    insofar as the allegations relating to financial irregularities. I see no real
                    issue in this. As such, it could not be said that the appellant was exercising
                    the right to inspect in order to obtain documents which would otherwise not be
                    discoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As a final observation, in determining whether
                    the exercise is for the performance of director’s duties, the court should
                    adopt a broad and liberal interpretation so as not to render the right nugatory.
                    It is a right that comes with the office. In the present case, there is no doubt
                    in my mind that the inspection has a sufficient nexus to the appellant’s
                    duties as a director. It would be too narrow to construe the right as limited to
                    duties in relation to accounts or for the performance of present and future
                    duties only, a view which I have rejected above (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>–<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For the reasons furnished above, I hold that
                    the right to inspect the Companies’ accounts is related to the
                    appellant’s discharge of his director’s duties even if he did so
                    with a view to prove that he had not acted in breach of his duties. As said in
                        <em>Berlei</em> at pp163–164:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“No court will act upon a mere presumption that a director will in
                        a given situation act in breach of his fiduciary duty to the company...it
                        must be proved, either by words or conduct, that there in fact exists an
                        intention on the part of the director to use the information not for the
                        benefit of the company and the shareholders...”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fact, to suggest that the appellant should be denied the right to
                    inspect accounts accessible by the directors to account for his action is
                    “unthinkable” (see Iles, Nicholas, (1997) <em>The
                        Corporation, its Former Directors &amp; Legal Professional
                        Privilege</em> Bond Law Review: Vol. 9: Iss 1,
                    Article 2 at p18).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the premises, I allow the appeal in RA 492.
                    Given my decision in RA 492, there is strictly no necessity to deal with RA
                    491. However, for completeness, I will briefly explain why I agree with the AR
                    that the application for specific discovery was indeed premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Specific discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The regime governing specific discovery is set
                    out in O 24 rr 5(3) and 7 of the Rules of Court. However, a hurdle
                    which the appellant would need to overcome is O 24 r 5(4), which provides
                    that the court will not order specific discovery <em>before</em> general discovery unless it is of the opinion that doing
                    so is <em>necessary</em> or <em>desirable</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The appellant argued that specific discovery
                    was necessary in the circumstances to aid the court in arriving at its decision
                    whether to grant the respondent leave to commence the derivative action in OS
                    879. Specifically, the appellant alleged that the documents would establish that
                    the respondent was not acting in good faith or in the interests of the Companies
                    (see <em>Pang Yong Hock &amp; another v PKS Contracts Services
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 at [20] and <em>Law Chin Eng &amp;
                        Another v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd</em> [2009] SGHC 223 at
                        [19]). Bad faith would be
                    demonstrated by establishing that the respondent had cherry picked documents to
                    present to the forensic accountants, thereby furthering his intention of
                    pursuing a “personal vendetta” against the appellant through the
                    derivative action in OS 879. Specific discovery of the Companies’ accounts
                    would also permit the appellant to better demonstrate to the court his innocence
                    in relation to the alleged financial irregularities. This would in turn confirm
                    that the respondent was not acting in the interests of the Companies by wasting
                    the Companies’ already limited coffers on unmeritorious
                litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The respondent relied on the trite proposition
                    at law which provides that, at the leave stage, the court should not adjudicate
                    on disputed issues of fact, but merely to determine whether a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out (see <em>Teo
                        Gek Luang v Ng Ai Tiong and others</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 426
                    at [15] and <em>Agus
                        Irawan v Toh Teck Chye &amp; others</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 471 at [6] both
                    approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pang Yong Hock and another
                        v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 at
                        [16]–[19]). The respondent further averred that the
                    appellant was seeking to “usurp” the function of the general
                    discovery process in the derivative action by “fishing” for
                    information to support his defence which was not even due for
                filing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The question whether the court will grant an
                    order for specific discovery at such an early stage of proceedings
                    (specifically, before pleadings are closed), was considered in <em>RHM Foods and Another v Bovril Ltd</em>
                    [1982] 1 WLR 661 where the plaintiff brought an action of passing
                    off against the defendant. The plaintiff subsequently applied for discovery of
                    certain documents after issuing a writ and a motion of its intention to apply
                    for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from continuing to
                    pass off their product, but prior to filing a statement of claim. The English
                    Court of Appeal dismissed the application and held that, although
                    O 24 r 7 (the Singapore equivalent being O 25 r 5)
                    gave the court discretion to order specific discovery prior to filing of
                    pleadings, such discretion would only be exercised in
                    “exceptional” circumstances. The main reason for this was that it
                    would be unfair to compel a party to provide unilateral discovery before the
                    other party has formally pleaded its case (at 665–669). The court also
                    felt that, until at least a statement of claim was delivered by setting out the
                    matters in question in the action, it could not properly exercise its discretion
                    (at 665). The same reasoning <em>mutatis mutandis</em> is
                    applicable, and was in fact applied in the Hong Kong decision of <em>Bank of India v Gobindram Naraindas Sadhwani &amp; Anor</em>
                    [1994] 2 HKLR 69 to a defendant who had not filed a defence prior to
                    the application. In my view, this must be right: prevention of a
                    “fishing” expedition prior to general discovery must apply both
                    ways in the interests of consistency and fairness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I find that the appellant has clearly failed
                    to discharge the burden to show “exceptional” circumstances to
                    justify discovery at this stage of the proceedings. I note that the respondent
                    has relied on grounds extending beyond allegations of financial irregularities
                    against the appellant in OS 879. Other breaches include, <em>inter alia</em>, the following<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                            against the Companies for wrongful dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Usurping corporate opportunities from
                        the Companies by allowing the lease for the flagship restaurant at Ngee Ann
                        City to lapse and subsequently operating a competing restaurant, <em>Pepes</em>, at the same location.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Placing himself in a position of
                        conflict against the interests of the Companies by incorporating Ochacha
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Simple Spice Pte Ltd, that ran the principal
                        activities of retail sale of food and beverages and a restaurant business
                        respectively. The appellant also failed to disclose the existence of these
                        companies to the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     Improper management of the restaurant operations, such as
                        the termination of the leases at Causeway Point and Suntec City and the
                        ceasing of operations of the Centrepoint outlet, despite the fact that the
                        business was still profitable. As a result, the Companies breached the
                        Memorandum of Lease entered into with Frasers Centrepoint, which included a
                        covenant binding SHPL to operate an Indonesian restaurant on the unit and to
                        keep the restaurant open daily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In my view, discovery of the Companies’
                    accounts would not be able to summarily address the above non-financial
                    allegations in any event. As such, it is difficult to see how discovery of the
                    Companies’ accounts would necessarily dispose of the intended derivative
                    action in OS 879 at the leave stage. It follows that the appellant’s
                    argument that the discovery would save time and costs simply cannot
                    stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I therefore allow the appeal in RA 492 while
                    that in RA 491 is dismissed. Since the bulk of the submissions related to RA
                    492, the cost orders should be reflected accordingly. I order the respondent to
                    pay the appellant a net cost amount of $3,500 inclusive of disbursements for
                    both appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It leaves me now to thank both Mr Yeo and
                    Mr Wong for their helpful submissions together with their citations of
                    relevant case authorities which assisted me in writing this
                decision.</p>
