Notwithstanding that, however, Kroll continued to be a shareholder of CTX and through subsequent events averred to by him in the SOC, his shareholding was increased. Kroll says that in January 2021, Wong and Hong agreed to increase his shareholding percentage upwards to 3.24%. This was because there had been other parties, including Bai and a company controlled by him known as Asia Green Fund Management Limited (“Asia Green Fund”), that had purchased shares in CTX at lower valuations than the valuation at which Kroll purchased his CTX shares under the Subscription Agreement.

According to Kroll, in mid-April 2021, Wong and Hong had pressured him to exit CTX at a low price. Wong and Hong had told Kroll that CTX was insolvent and faced severe cashflow difficulties. This was exacerbated by the fact that CTX had to buyback all its shares held by another minority investor Xiamen Anne Corporation Limited (“Xiamen Anne”), which were valued at S$10m. The buyback was necessitated by problems that Xiamen Anne faced with China’s security regulators. Against this background, Wong and Hong told Kroll that they had found Bai, who was willing to invest and inject cash into CTX. Wong and Hong told Kroll that there was some urgency in Bai’s investment, and the injection had to take place before 30 April 2021 because that was the deadline for CTX to re-submit its CML application to the MAS.

</div> The Defendants emphasised that it is not sufficient for them, in their defence, to merely admit to or deny the pleaded acts in question, because the main issue dealt with in a minority oppression claim is not merely the existence or non-existence of those pleaded acts, but whether the legitimate expectations of the plaintiff have been breached by those acts. A further problem arising from the lack of particulars is that, on the Defendants’ case, each of them had played a different role in CTX’s affairs at the material time (see also [5] above), and so as Kroll’s pleadings stand, it is impossible for the Defendants to discern who had been a party to the legitimate expectation relied on by Kroll, and whose conduct would constitute a departure from those legitimate expectations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The position taken by Kroll in SUM 1405, which can be summarised as the following three main points, is consistent with that which he had previously taken when responding to the Defendants’ request for particulars dated 11 April 2023, in respect of the SOC, the R2DCC, the R3D and the R4D.

</div> It is not in dispute that the legitimate expectation relating to that complaint – though not its source – have been particularised at para 48 of the SOC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 SUM 1405 raises three issues for determination: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in a claim for minority oppression under s 216(1) of the Companies Act, what are the facts that must be contained in the plaintiff’s pleadings in order that the pleadings not be deficient, and do they extend to include the <span class="font-italic">source</span> of the legitimate expectations relied on by the plaintiff, as the Defendants argue? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, in a claim for minority oppression, must <span class="font-italic">every</span> act alleged of the defendant-majority by the plaintiff in its pleadings be accompanied by particulars relating to the legitimate expectation that had been breached by that act? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, in the light of how the foregoing issues are determined, whether and to what extent the Defendants’ requests for particulars in SUM 1405 are to be allowed? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What must be contained in the pleadings for a claim in minority oppression? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Pleadings, which ought to set out the allegations of fact which a party asserting has to prove to the satisfaction of the court and on which it is entitled to relief under the law, is intended to delineate the parameters of a case and define the issues before the court, and also inform the parties of the case that they have to meet (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span><span class="font-italic">”) </span>at [36]). A party must therefore set out in its pleadings the “material facts”, which are facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action (see <span class="font-italic">EA Apartments Pte Ltd v Tan Bek </span>[2017] 3 SLR 559 at [21]). Exactly what constitutes “material facts” is dependent on the context and the legal character of the claims advanced in each case, but at the minimum, it will necessarily encompass those facts that are necessary to put the defendants on notice of the case that they have to meet when it comes on trial (see <span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span>at [35]). “Material facts” are to be distinguished from the evidence by which the pleaded facts are to be proven, which will not be an appropriate subject in a request for particulars (see <span class="font-italic">Sharikat Logistics Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Chuan and others </span>[2011] SGHC 196 at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The question of what facts must be set out in a pleading for a claim in minority oppression therefore turns on what constitutes “material facts” for the purposes of such a claim. The starting point of the analysis is to consider its legal character.  Section 216(1) of the Companies Act provides for four alternative but non-disjunctive situations in which relief may be invoked by a minority shareholder, the common thread of which is the existence of unfairness, namely, a departure<span class="font-italic"> </span>from the standards of fair dealing and a violation<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is <span class="font-italic">entitled </span>to expect (see <span class="font-italic">Over </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd</span>”) at [70] and [77]; <span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym Wendy and others v Thio Syn Pyn and others </span>[2017] SGHC 196 (“<span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym</span>”) at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 These standards of fair dealing and fair play are derived from the legitimate expectations of the minority shareholder, which arise either from (a) the minority’s legal rights enjoyed under the instruments that regulate their intra-corporate relationship with the majority, such as the company’s Constitution or any collateral shareholder agreements that might have been entered into or (b) informal understandings or assumptions shared between the minority and the majority and which formed the basis of their association, which can arise either in the context of a quasi-partnership, or independently of whether the company is a quasi-partnership (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [78] and [84]; <span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym </span>at [43]–[44]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Lim Boh Yong and others and other matters </span>[2015] 5 SLR 307<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [106]).  These legitimate expectations are not prescriptive <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the majority, in that they do not <span class="font-italic">provide </span>for what the majority is entitled to do in respect of their conduct of the company’s affairs. Instead, they impose <span class="font-italic">limits</span> on what the majority can do, and as a corollary, delineate what they cannot do. In this regard, it bears mention the majority’s conduct can nevertheless come in excess of these limits and call for the court’s intervention under s 216(1) of the Companies Act, even if the majority is acting within the fold of its strict legal rights (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [85]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In a claim for minority oppression, the gist of the plaintiff’s complaint is that the majority’s conduct is in excess of those limits imposed by the standards of fair dealing and fair play that govern the parties’ intra-corporate relationship. Obviously, therefore, the plaintiff must set out in its pleadings the legitimate expectations pursuant to which it says it is entitled to the majority <span class="font-italic">not </span>acting in the way they had. However, stating or identifying these legitimate expectations<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">alone </span>is insufficient. The plaintiff must also set out in its pleadings the facts relating how<span class="font-italic"> </span>the legitimate expectation had been derived or arrived at, or as the Defendants have put it in SUM 1405, the “source” of the legitimate expectation. This is so, for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 First, in the context of the law on minority oppression, the concept of a “legitimate expectation” is a legal construct, just like the concept of a “quasi-partnership”. A plaintiff cannot simply <span class="font-italic">assert </span>the existence of a legitimate expectation; that a legitimate expectation exists is a fact to be found by the court, by reference to other facts proven at the trial of the action. These other facts will necessarily<span class="font-italic"> </span>include, but are not limited to, those relating to <span class="font-italic">how </span>the plaintiff had come to enjoy that legitimate expectation. These facts will encompass the terms of the company’s Constitution or the relevant shareholders’ agreements, as well as the informal agreements or understandings between the minority and majority, pursuant to which the legitimate expectations are said to arise. These are also facts which the plaintiff must prove to the court’s satisfaction, in order for the court to find that it indeed held the legitimate expectation which it now claims to have been breached. In other words, these are facts which the plaintiff must <span class="font-italic">prove </span>in order to obtain the relief sought (see <span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span>at [36]), and it is trite that these facts must be set out in the pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Second, without the plaintiff also pleading <span class="font-italic">how </span>the legitimate expectation had been arrived at, the defendant will not be notified of the case it has to meet. A defendant can defend itself in a minority oppression claim, either by saying that the legitimate expectations claimed by the plaintiff do not exist, or that the conduct complained of by the minority does not depart from those legitimate expectations. For the defendant to do the former, it necessarily must be put on notice of <span class="font-italic">how </span>the legitimate expectation had been arrived at, without which the defendant will have no basis to dispute the existence of the legitimate expectation. The plaintiff’s pleadings therefore must contain facts relating to the <span class="font-italic">source </span>of its legitimate expectations, so that the defendant can identify the defences that it can correspondingly put forward to dispute the existence of the legitimate expectation, for example, by saying that the articles of association relied on by the minority do not have the effect contended for, or that the informal agreement or understanding relied on by the minority in fact never existed or had been misconstrued by the minority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Therefore, in my view, where a plaintiff relies on certain legitimate expectations in a minority oppression claim under s 216(1) of the Companies Act, the “material facts” that the plaintiff must set out in its pleadings will include facts relating to <span class="font-italic">how </span>those legitimate expectations had been arrived at, such as the strict legal rights enjoyed by the minority as contained in the instruments regulating the parties’ intra-corporate relationship like the company’s Constitution or shareholders’ agreements, and/or the informal understandings or assumptions shared between the minority and the majority and how those understandings or assumptions had been arrived at. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Must every act alleged of the majority be accompanied by particulars as to the legitimate expectation breached? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Oppression can arise from an isolated or distinct act that is plainly contrary to the minority’s legitimate expectations – for example, a dilution of the minority’s shareholding despite an expectation to the contrary (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [74]; <span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym </span>at [42]; see also Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“Chew”) at para 4.233). Oppression can also arise from the cumulative effect of a course of conduct; in other words when the impugned conduct straddles several categories or grounds of oppressive conduct and are considered cumulatively to amount to a departure from the standards of fair dealing and fair play (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [128]; Chew at para 4.233).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 An example of a case in which oppression had been found from a course of conduct was <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd</span>. In that case, the plaintiff had relied on three incidents in establishing its claim for minority oppression against the defendants, who were the majority in a hotel joint venture: a set of related party transactions that the majority had procured, which involved entities related to the majority providing services to the hotel; a subsequent sale of shares by the majority to a publicly-listed company; and a rights issuance conducted in haste under the guise of allowing the company to discharge an outstanding loan. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the related party transactions had not been oppressive but disagreed with the trial judge’s findings in respect of the share sale and rights issue (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [99], [105] and [127]). The Court of Appeal found the share sale and issuance of rights, each of which were commercially unfair on their own, as constituting the “course of conduct” over which oppression of the minority took place (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [128]). The Court of Appeal further held that, while the related party transactions had not been oppressive, it was nevertheless relevant because it was indicative of the proclivity of the majority to abuse its rights at the expense of the minority whenever there was a collision of interests, and so it coloured the context in which the share sale and issuance of rights took place (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [99]–[100]). Hence, while the related party transactions did not form part of the “course of conduct” over which oppression of the minority took place, they nevertheless provided the background against which the two instances of oppression were to be assessed (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [128]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Thus, where the plaintiff’s case on minority oppression is founded upon the cumulative effect of a course of conduct, an act or an episode of conduct that is found to <span class="font-italic">not </span>constitute oppression can nevertheless form the background against which the other instances of oppressive conduct are to be assessed. Similarly, it must follow that, not every act or instance of conduct alleged of the majority and averred to in the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim is necessarily an allegation of oppression, and it could well have been pleaded by the plaintiff to provide the background against which the other oppressive acts are to be assessed. A distinction therefore must be drawn between those acts or incidents of conduct that the plaintiff alleges to constitute oppression and for which it is relying on as a ground of relief under s 216(1) of the Companies Act, and those which are merely intended to form part of the background, against which allegations of oppression are to be assessed. Of course, whether an act or an incident of conduct comes within the former or latter category would be a question of reading the plaintiff’s pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, it is only in respect of acts or incidents of conduct relied on by the plaintiff as a ground of relief under s 216(1) of the Companies Act that the plaintiff can be obliged to provide particulars of legitimate expectations. It is only for such acts or incidents of conduct that the plaintiff is complaining that there had been a breach of legitimate expectations. Conversely, where the act or incident of conduct is <span class="font-italic">not </span>relied on as a ground of relief, it is not the plaintiff’s case that there had been a breach of legitimate expectations, and it would effectively be an attempt at fitting a square peg in a round hole to oblige the plaintiff to provide particulars on legitimate expectations in respect of that act or incident of conduct. After all, the plaintiff’s obligation to plead material facts and provide the necessary particular of its claim is coincident with the complexion of its pleaded case, since these facts and particulars are provided for the defendant to understand what <span class="font-italic">that </span>pleaded case is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Before concluding this section, let me make some brief observations on the argument by Kroll’s counsel that Kroll is not obliged to provide particulars in respect of the various instances of alleged non-disclosure and/or omissions, because those are relied on by Kroll as forming part of the “course of conduct” culminating in the share issuance which Kroll complains is oppressive. The point which counsel appears to make is, because oppression can be found from a <span class="font-italic">course of conduct</span>, there is no requirement that the plaintiff provide particulars of the legitimate expectations that had been breached by the various acts alleged of the majority, so long as those acts form part of the course of conduct that ultimately led to an outcome that was oppressive for the plaintiff. In support of this submission, counsel pointed me to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd</span>, in which oppression was found from a “course of conduct”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I reject this submission, as it is, in my view, an incorrect reading of the Court of Appeal’s decision <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd</span>. As I have mentioned above, the “course of conduct” that the Court of Appeal had found  to cumulatively amount to oppression in<span class="font-italic"> Over &amp; Over Ltd</span> comprised two incidents, each of which the Court of Appeal was satisfied had been oppressive (see [39] above). Thus, even if a plaintiff alleges that oppression took the form of a course of conduct, it must still establish that each of the impugned acts constituting that course of conduct is oppressive or commercially unfair,  the only difference being that, because the court would have regard to the <span class="font-italic">cumulative effect </span>of the impugned conduct (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd </span>at [127]), while it might not have been satisfied that the various instances of impugned conduct constitute oppression <span class="font-italic">individually</span>, it might well come to a different conclusion when things are viewed <span class="font-italic">cumulatively</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and in respect of their present and future effect (see Chew at para 4.233, citing <span class="font-italic">Re Norvabron Pty Ltd (No 2) </span>(1986) 11 ACLR 279). That the court considers the cumulative effect of the different instances of impugned conduct in cases where oppression is alleged by the plaintiff to have arisen from a “course of conduct”, does not relieve the plaintiff of its burden of having to establish that each of the impugned acts were oppressive individually, only that the requisite threshold for a finding of oppression may be different because the court does not consider each act in isolation but in conjunction with other impugned acts. By parity of reasoning, even when oppression is alleged by plaintiff to take the form of a “course of conduct”, each of the acts alleged to constitute part of that course of conduct would still be relied on by the minority as a ground of relief under s 216(1) of the Companies Act, and in respect of which particulars as to the legitimate expectation breached must be provided, as explained above (at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further, this submission appears to conflate the <span class="font-italic">conduct </span>of the majority and the <span class="font-italic">outcome </span>of that conduct in the context of minority oppression claims. Section 216(1) of the Companies Act provides relief to the minority in respect of the majority’s <span class="font-italic">conduct</span>, and not the outcome <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Whether there has been commercial unfairness, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a departure from legitimate expectations, is also assessed in respect of that <span class="font-italic">conduct</span>. What the court is concerned with is whether the way in which the majority had acted constitutes such a departure. It is therefore no answer for Kroll resist a request for particulars in respect of acts alleged of the Defendants, on the basis that those acts form part of the course of conduct that culminated in an unfair outcome. If those acts are relied on by him as a ground of relief in Suit 915, then it remains his burden to prove that each of those acts are commercially unfair, and in turn, he would be obliged to provide particulars on the legitimate expectations breached, in respect of those acts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether and to what extent the Defendants’ requests for particulars are to be allowed? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With the above, I turn to the facts and consider the merits of the Defendants’ requests for particulars in SUM 1405. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The starting point of the inquiry is whether the conduct alleged of the Defendants in the paragraphs to which the requests in SUM 1405 relate is relied on by Kroll as a ground of relief in Suit 915.

</div> and that the issuance of shares at the 30 April EGM, which severely diluted his minority shareholding, was commercially unfair, though for completeness, I should add that the Defendants’ position is that the provision against dilution in the Subscription Agreement is of no relevance to the share issuance at the 30 April 2021 and in May 2021, since those shares were issued to Bai and his related entities against investment consideration. In any case, the complaints to which the remaining paragraphs of Section IV of the SOC appear to relate are not the subject of the requests in SUM 1405. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I note that paras 52 and 53 of the SOC contain a general averment that, by reason of the facts pleaded in the remaining paragraphs of the SOC, which will include those paragraphs in the SOC containing the allegations of omissions and non-disclosure and in respect of which particulars are sought in SUM 1405, the Defendants have acted in breach of Kroll’s legitimate expectations, and also conducted the affairs of CTX in a manner that was oppressive and prejudicial to Kroll (see also [8] and [17]–[21] above). The question then is whether it might be said that, because of the general averment contained in paras 52 and 53 of the SOC, the allegations of omissions and non-disclosure are therefore <span class="font-italic">all</span> relied on by Kroll as grounds of relief in Suit 915, and so it is not possible, as I have attempted, to draw a distinction between conduct relied on as a ground of relief and those merely pleaded by way of background (see [41] above). In my view, this is not an issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 First, this <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be an issue in this case because Kroll has chosen to specifically set out at para 97 a summary of the grounds of relief which he relies on. It is therefore permissible, and correct as a matter of principle, that the court utilises para 97 as the basis for distinguishing between conduct of the majority relied on as a ground of relief and those merely pleaded by way of background. Secondly, in my view, a general averment like that contained in paras 52 and 53 of the SOC, read in the context of the SOC as pleaded, cannot have the effect of rendering every act or incident of conduct referred to in the paragraphs captured thereunder as conduct relied on as grounds of relief. Given how the general averment at paras 52 and 53 are worded, and coupled with the breadth and scope of the allegations contained in the paragraphs of the SOC that follow, the general averment at paras 52 and 53 will not have the effect of defining the issues before the court and informing the parties of the case that they have to meet (see <span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([31] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36]). For the avoidance of doubt, let me emphasise that, whether a general averment can have the effect of capturing all acts or incidents of conduct referred to in the paragraphs thereunder as conduct relied on as grounds of relief is dependent on how exactly the pleading has been worded. The point I make here is therefore limited to the present case, in that, in the context of the SOC as pleaded, paras 52 and 53 cannot be read as having that effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 With the above in mind, I turn to consider each of the requests in SUM 1405. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Categories 1, 10 and 14</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I begin with the requests in Categories 1, 10 and 14. The paragraphs of the pleadings to which these requests respectively relate are: para 59 of the SOC; para 138(a) of the R2DCC; and para 111(a) of the R3D. The complaint made in these paragraphs is that Wong and/or Hong failed to disclose to Kroll the Zeepson and Saibotan contracts. The payments made under these contracts were described in the relevant paragraphs of the R2DCC and R3D as giving rise to “significant liabilities for CTX”. The same point is made in the SOC, albeit at para 58, where it is said that the payments made amounted to approximately 35% of CTX’s paid-up capital at the time. On Kroll’s pleaded case (whether in the SOC or in the R2DCC and the R3D), the liabilities incurred under the Zeepson and Saibotan contracts were a reason for CTX’s subsequent financial difficulties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 What these paragraphs complain of is not the fact of CTX’s entry into the Zeepson and Saibotan contracts. The allegation here is Wong and/or Hong’s failure to provide to Kroll information about these contracts, which Kroll says gave rise to significant liabilities for CTX.  Thus, the issue is whether the failure by Wong and/or Hong to provide information in this instance amounted to a withholding of “material information from Mr Kroll”, which is relied on by Kroll at para 97(d) of the SOC as a ground of relief in Suit 916. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In particulars served by Kroll pursuant to the Defendants’ request dated 1 April 2022, in which the Defendants had requested for particulars as to the “material information” which is said at para 97(d) to have been withheld from Kroll <span class="font-italic">qua </span>shareholder, Kroll states that the “material information”:

Therefore, I accept that the withholding or non-provision of the information relating to the Zeepson and Saibotan contracts is relied on by Kroll under para 97(d) of the SOC as a ground of relief. Accordingly, for this allegation of non-provision of material information, Kroll must provide particulars of the legitimate expectation relied on, including why Wong and/or Hong were obliged to disclose this information to him, as well as the source of this legitimate expectation.

I understand this request to be directed at ascertaining whether the legitimate expectation relating to the disclosure of material information is shared between Kroll (on the one hand) and either Wong or Hong or both (on the other). It is on this basis that I allowed the requests in Categories 1(a) and (b). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Categories 2 and 11</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I now turn to the requests in Categories 2 and 11. The paragraphs of the pleadings to which these requests respectively relate are: para 64A of the SOC; and para 141A of the R2DCC. The complaint made in these paragraphs is that the Defendants failed to disclose to Kroll (a) the existence of the Investment Agreements and (b) that Wong had personal obligations under the equity investment agreement between CTX and Xiamen Anne entered into in 2019 to repurchase all of Xiamen Anne’s shares if the stipulated conditions in the agreement were not met and on Xiamen Anne’s request. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Reading these paragraphs in context, I understand that the point made by Kroll, when referring to the alleged non-disclosure of the Investment Agreements, is to emphasise that CTX was in fact <span class="font-italic">not</span> in such dire financial straits that Wong and Hong had represented to him, which formed the pretext to the subsequent discussions in which they asked for Kroll to be bought out, and eventually, the issuance of shares at the 30 April EGM pursuant to the adoption of the Rescue Proposal. This is because CTX in fact had ready recourse to financing under the terms of the Investment Agreements. Accordingly, the adoption of the Rescue Proposal would have been unnecessary, and similarly, it would not have been in in the best interests of CTX. The allegation relating to non-disclosure of the Investment Agreements therefore appears to provide the context in which the issuance of shares and dilution of Kroll’s shareholding took place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 However, “material information”, the withholding of which Kroll relies on as a ground of relief at para 97(d) of the SOC, is said to also include “the arrangements and/or agreements that CTX had entered into with the 3rd Defendant/his associated companies”. This would include the Investment Agreements which, on Kroll’s pleaded case, was entered into between CTX and two companies “connected to and/or controlled by” Bai.

</div>
</div> The non-provision of information relating to the Investment Agreements is therefore relied by Kroll as a ground of relief. Accordingly, Kroll must provide particulars of the legitimate expectation relied on, and its source, in connection with this alleged non-disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As for Wong’s personal obligations under the equity investment agreement between CTX and Xiamen Anne, this does not come within any of the categories of “material information” pleaded at para 97(d) of the SOC. I considered if it might be possible to take the view that the information relating to Wong’s personal obligations would constitute “information relating to CTX’s expenditure … that resulted in CTX’s financial difficulties”. That is a possible reading because there is some relationship between Wong’s personal obligations and CTX’s expenditure arising from its buyback of Xiamen Anne’s shares – if Wong in fact had personal obligations to repurchase Xiamen Anne’s CTX shares, then it might be said to have been unnecessary for CTX to repurchase those shares and incur the resulting financial difficulties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, I rejected that view. This is because CTX’s obligation to repurchase Xiamen Anne’s shares, which is said to have arisen following issues that Xiamen Anne encountered with its Chinese security regulators, is separate and distinct from Wong’s personal obligation to repurchase Xiamen Anne’s shares, which existed under the terms of the equity investment agreement between CTX and Xiamen Anne entered into in 2019. Also, on the pleaded facts, Wong’s personal obligation appears to have existed prior to the crystallisation of CTX’s repurchase obligations. Accordingly, information relating to Wong’s personal obligations cannot be said to be relevant or relate to the expenditure that CTX was to incur as a result of its repurchase of Xiamen Anne’s shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For the reasons explained above, the non-disclosure of Wong’s personal obligations is not relied on as a ground of relief, and so there is no basis for Kroll to be ordered to provide particulars in respect of this allegation. Further, reading these paragraphs as a whole, I understand Kroll to be suggesting that it had been unnecessary for CTX to repurchase Xiamen Anne’s shares, since Wong could have repurchased those shares pursuant to its personal obligations. Therefore, the expenditure arising from CTX’s repurchase of Xiamen Anne’s shares was unnecessary, and so CTX in fact did not face such significant financial difficulties as Wong and/or Hong claimed it did. Accordingly, it could not be said that the adoption of the Rescue Proposal and the subsequent share issuance was in the best interests of CTX and its minority shareholders, including Kroll. On this basis, I accept that the reference to the Defendants’ non-disclosure of Wong’s personal obligations is intended to provide the background against which the subsequent share issuance and dilution of Kroll’s shareholding took place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the above reasons, I allow the requests in Categories 2 and 11, only to the extent that it relates to the Defendants’ non-disclosure of the Investment Agreements, but not in respect of Wong’s personal obligations under the equity investment agreement between CTX and Xiamen Anne. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Categories 6, 7 and 12</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I now turn to the requests in Categories 6, 7 and 12. The paragraphs of the pleadings to which each of these requests respectively relate are: para 30(e) of the R2DCC; para 96(a) of the R2DCC; and para 60(b) of the R3D. The complaint made in these paragraphs is that Kroll was “neither consulted on nor privy to” or made “aware of the terms” of the investment or subscription agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX. It will appear that there are two omissions identified in this complaint, though it is not apparent from the pleadings as to who among the Defendants were involved: (a) that Kroll was not “consulted on” the investment or subscription agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX; and (b) that the terms of that agreement were not made known to Kroll. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, for all three categories, the Defendants only seek particulars in respect of the first omission, namely, that Kroll had not been consulted on the investment or subscription agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX. Nowhere in the SOC does Kroll rely on the Defendants’ failure to consult him, whether specifically in connection with that agreement, or more generally, in connection with CTX’s affairs, as a ground of relief. It is also not Kroll’s pleaded case that the Defendants are obliged, in their conduct and management of CTX’s affairs, to consult him on matters like the investment or subscription agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX. Since this omission to consult Kroll is not relied on by Kroll as a ground of relief, there is no basis for Kroll to be ordered to provide particulars.  I therefore do not allow the requests in Categories 6, 7 and 12. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For completeness, let me state that, even if particulars had been requested in respect of the second omission, I would not have allowed them. The investment or subscription agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX does not come within any of the categories of “material information” referred to at para 97(d) of the SOC. The arrangements and/or agreements between CTX and its other shareholders, which Kroll has classified as coming under “material information”, are limited to those relating to the buyout of those other shareholders. It does not include arrangements and/or agreements under which those shareholders came to invest in CTX. Accordingly, the non-disclosure of information relating to the investment or subscription agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX is not relied on by Kroll as a ground of relief, and so there is in any event no basis for Kroll to be ordered to provide particulars in respect of this allegation.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Category 8 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I now turn to the request in Category 8, which relates to para 96(b) of the R2DCC. The complaint made here is that Kroll was “neither consulted on nor privy to” or made “aware of the terms” of the buyout or exit deal agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX. This would appear to refer to the arrangement, pursuant to which CTX undertook to repurchase all of Xiamen Anne’s shares, which Kroll states Wong and Hong had informed him of (see [9] above).

</div> There are similarly two omissions identified in this complaint, similar to the paragraphs of the pleadings to which the requests in Categories 6, 7 and 12 relate, namely: (a) that Kroll was not “consulted on” the buyout or exit deal; and (b) that Kroll was not made aware of the terms of that buyout or exit deal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Similar to the requests in Categories 6, 7 and 12, for Category 8, the Defendants only seek particulars in respect of the first omission that Kroll had not been consulted on the buyout or exit deal agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX. However, similar to the analysis above, nowhere in the SOC does Kroll rely on the Defendants’ failure to consult him, whether specifically in connection with that agreement, or more generally, in connection with CTX’s affairs, as a ground of relief. It is also not Kroll’s pleaded case that the Defendants are obliged, in their conduct and management of CTX’s affairs, to consult him on matters like the buyout or exit deal agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX. Since this omission to consult Kroll is not relied on as a ground of relief, there is no basis for Kroll to be ordered to provide particulars in respect of this allegation. I therefore do not allow the requests in Category 8. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For completeness, let me state that, if particulars had been requested in respect of the first omission, I would have allowed them. The buyout or exit deal agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX is an example of “buyout arrangements and/or agreements that CTX had entered into with its other shareholders” and so comes within the category of “material information” referred to at para 97(d) of the SOC. The non-disclosure of the buyout or exit deal agreement between Xiamen Anne and CTX is therefore a ground of relief relied on by Kroll, as stated at para 97(d) of the SOC, and in respect of which Kroll can be obliged to provide particulars if the Defendants had sought these particulars. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Categories 9, 13 and 15</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I now turn to the requests in Categories 9, 13 and 15. The paragraphs of the pleadings to which each of these requests respectively relate are: (a) para 96(c) of the R2DCC; (b) para 60(c) of the R3D; and (c) para 22 of the R4D. The complaint made in these paragraphs is two-fold: (a) first, that Kroll had not been provided with evidence of Xiamen Anne’s regulatory breaches that necessitated the buyback of Xiamen Anne’s shareholding by CTX; and (b) second, that Wong and/or Hong failed to demonstrate that their “claims” were true. These “claims” appear to be a reference to the claims which Kroll avers in the SOC as having been made by Wong and Hong when they pressured him to exit CTX at a low price, which included a claim about Xiamen Anne having faced issues with its Chinese security regulators (see [9] above).

</div>
</div> Accordingly, evidence of Xiamen Anne’s regulatory breaches is an example of “information relating to CTX’s … anticipated expenditure that resulted in CTX’s alleged financial difficulties”,  and so comes within the category of “material information” referred to at para 97(d) of the SOC. The non-disclosure of evidence of Xiamen Anne’s regulatory breaches is therefore a ground of relief relied on by Kroll, as stated at para 97(d) of the SOC, and in respect of which Kroll is obliged to provide particulars. I therefore allow the requests in Categories 9(a) and 9(b), 13(a) and 13(b), as well as 15(a) and 15(b). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I turn now to the second complaint raised in these paragraphs, which is that Wong and/or Hong failed to demonstrate to Kroll that their claims relating to Xiamen Anne’s regulatory breaches were true. The gist of the complaint here is not one of failure to provide information, but rather, that Wong and/or Hong failed to do something in their conduct of CTX’s affairs <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Kroll. Nowhere in the SOC does Kroll rely on this omission as a ground of relief. It is also not Kroll’s pleaded case that Wong and/or Hong are obliged, in their conduct and management of CTX’s affairs, to provide evidence or proof to substantiate their representations made to Kroll, whether generally or specifically in respect of this representation pertaining to the buyback of Xiamen Anne’s shares. Accordingly, there is no basis for Kroll to provide particulars in respect of the second complaint. Thus, save for the requests mentioned above (at [71]), I disallow the remaining requests in Categories 9, 13 and 15. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Categories 5 and 16 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I now turn to the requests in Categories 5 and 16. The paragraphs of the pleadings to which these requests respectively relate are: (a) para 29(c) of the R2DCC; and (b) para 25(a) of the R4D. The complaint made by Kroll in these paragraphs is that, from the time he became a shareholder of CTX, he had not been provided adequate details on the investors or sources of funding <span class="font-italic">explored</span> by CTX, other than Bai’s offer to invest in CTX. The complaint here is that of non-provision of information, and specifically, information relating to other <span class="font-italic">potential </span>investors or sources of funding, given the qualification “explored by CTX”. Information relating to <span class="font-italic">potential </span>investors, however, does not come within the category of “material information” referred to in para 97(d) of the SOC. Therefore, the non-provision of such information is not relied on by Kroll as a ground of relief, whether in para 97(d) of the SOC or anywhere else in the SOC, and accordingly, there is no basis for Kroll to be ordered to provide particulars relating to the legitimate expectation said to be breached by this allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For completeness, I also add that Kroll’s complaint about not having been provided adequate information about other potential investors or sources of funding, when read in context, is meant to provide the background and context to the share issuance at the 30 April EGM to Bai and his related entities. The point that Kroll appears to make by this averment is that CTX might well have had other options, and so Bai’s investment was not as necessary and essential to CTX as Wong and/or Hong had claimed. Therefore, reading this complaint in context, it appears to be intended to provide the background to the share issuance and to support the view that the share issuance was commercially unfair. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Category 3</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I now turn to the request in Category 3, which relates to a part of para 92 of the SOC. The complaint made here is that Wong never disclosed to Kroll that CTX had been valued at US$200m pursuant to the Investment Agreements, which provided up to US$15m in funding. However, the complaint made here is not simply that Wong failed to disclose to Kroll the Investment Agreements (see [57]–[59] above), but that Wong had failed to disclose to Kroll the up-to-date valuation of CTX as obtained under the Investment Agreements. The fact that Wong is said to have failed to disclose is therefore not information relating to the “agreements that CTX had entered into with the 3rd defendant/his associated companies”, but rather, a specific attribute of CTX, which does not come within the category of “material information” relied on at para 97(d) of the SOC. Nowhere in the SOC does Kroll rely on the non-disclosure of this fact as a ground of relief. It is also not Kroll’s pleaded case that Wong is obliged, in his conduct and management of CTX’s affairs, to disclose the up-to-date valuation of CTX to Kroll from time to time. Accordingly, there is no basis for Kroll to be ordered to provide particulars in respect of this complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For completeness, I also add that, when read in context, the complaint made by Kroll at para 92 of the SOC is to demonstrate that the subsequent issuance of shares to Bai and/or his related entities at the 30 April EGM and on 12 May 2021 had taken place at unjustified valuations. Accordingly, this complaint is meant to provide the background in which the issuance of shares should be assessed, and to demonstrate that the Defendants’ conduct in respect of the share issuance had been commercially unfair. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Category 4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, I turn to the request in Category 4. This relates to para 97 of the SOC, which I have set out above (at [46]). Paragraph 97 of the SOC summarises the different grounds of relief relied on by Kroll. In Kroll’s response to the Defendants’ request for particulars dated 11 April 2023, Kroll had provided particulars of the legitimate expectations relied on (but not their source) in respect of para 97 of the SOC, which is the subject of the request in Category 4(a).

</div> This would constitute sufficient particulars, in so far as the identification of the relevant legitimate expectations is concerned. However, para 97 of the SOC does not contain particulars on the source of these legitimate expectations that have been identified, and so for the reasons I have explained above (at [37]), it remains deficient. I therefore allow in entirety the request in Category 4, while noting that the requests in Category 4(a) appear to have been answered to the Defendants’ satisfaction.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the above reasons, I allow in full the requests for particulars in Categories 1, 4, 10 and 14, allow in part the requests in categories 2, 9, 11, 13 and 15; and disallow the requests in Categories 3, 5–8, 12 and 16.

Given the way the SOC had been drafted, I necessarily had to engage in an exercise of interpreting the pleadings (whether on their own or in conjunction with the particulars that have been furnished previously) in determining whether the allegations contained in the pleadings and in respect of which particulars were sought in SUM 1405 are relied on by Kroll as grounds of relief under s 216(1) of the Companies Act, and in turn, whether the Defendants had a valid basis for their requests in SUM 1405 (see, for example, [60]–[61] above), which I acknowledge is imperfect. A concern therefore arises as to whether Kroll can subsequently, in the absence of a formal amendment to the SOC or his other pleadings, adopt as his case in Suit 915 an interpretation of the pleadings that is inconsistent with that which I have arrived at above, and on which I have relied in refusing some of the Defendants’ requests for particulars in SUM 1405. In my view, this is not an issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Under the doctrine of approbation and reprobation as applied in the context of litigation, a party is precluded from adopting an inconsistent position against another party in the proceedings, so long as it has received an actual benefit as a result of the earlier position that is inconsistent with that which it now seeks to adopt (see <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1296 at [103] and [118]). Kroll’s position in SUM 1405 is that all paragraphs in his pleadings in respect of which particulars were sought were simply pleaded by way of background, as illustrating the course of conduct that led to the issuance of shares, which he complains is commercially unfair (see [29] above). In other words, Kroll’s position must be that those paragraphs do not contain allegations that are relied on by him as grounds of relief. Indeed, it was emphasised by Kroll’s counsel in argument that those paragraphs in respect of which particulars were sought in SUM 1405 do not represent distinct allegations of oppression. By virtue of that position, Kroll has been relieved of having to provide certain particulars requested in SUM 1405. Having taken that benefit, I do not see how Kroll can subsequently proceed in Suit 915 on a different<span class="font-italic"> </span>interpretation of the SOC or his other pleadings that is inconsistent with that which he had taken as his position in SUM 1405, and which would defeat the basis on which some of the requests for particulars in SUM 1405 had <span class="font-italic">not </span>been allowed. I should emphasise, however, that the foregoing sentence is limited to the situation where Kroll seeks to adopt a different position in Suit 915 by virtue of an interpretation of the pleadings that is inconsistent with that which I have relied on in refusing some of the Defendants’ requests for particulars. Kroll is obviously free to adopt a different position by way of a formal amendment to the SOC or any other pleading he relies on and if the Defendants deem the amended pleadings deficient, they are free to seek particulars in a fresh request on whatever basis they deem fit, and SUM 1405 can have no relevance since the requests in SUM 1405 were in respect of the SOC and the other pleadings as they stood before me at the time SUM 1405 was heard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I will separately deal with the consequential directions arising from my decision as summarised above (at [78]), as well as the costs of SUM 1405, at a hearing to be fixed by the Registry.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Perry Peh<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Ee Hsien (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nikhil Angappan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the first defendant (watching brief);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Raeza Ibrahim, Yap Zhan Ming, Kimberly Ng and Annette Kong (Salem Ibrahim LLC) for the second to fourth defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
