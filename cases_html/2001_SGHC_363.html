<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1. This appeal turns on the effect of Article 22(2) of the Warsaw

Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol (hereinafter referred to as "the convention")

in limiting a carriers liability for the loss, damage or delay of baggage or cargo in the course

of carriage by air.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The facts of the appeal are not complicated. The consignor Philips Singapore

Pte Ltd shipped 1,000 cellular digital spark transceivers from Singapore to Hong Kong to the

consignee and plaintiff, Philips Hong Kong Ltd. The transceivers were shipped with the defendant

China Airlines Limited. An air waybill was made out by the consignor under Article 6 of the

convention stating the "No. of pieces" stated as "1" and the gross weight as 154

kilograms. In the consignors invoice attached to the waybill, the entry under "Packing

List" was "1 pallet". The pallet arrived at Hong Kong damaged, with a shortage of 440

transceivers of a total value of US$74,360.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. It is common ground between the parties the convention applies to the claim by

virtue of the Carriage by Air Act (Cap 32A).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The plaintiff accepts that it is not entitled to recover the full value of the

440 lost transceivers and that its claim is limited by Article 22(2) of the convention which

provides that</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the

  carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has

  made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of

  interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In

  that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves

  that that sum is greater than the passengers or consignors actual interest in delivery at

  destination.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or

  cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in

  determining the amount to which the carriers liability is limited shall be only the total

  weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a

  part of the registered baggage or cargo or of an object contained therein, affects the value of

  other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such

  package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Carriage by Air (Singapore Currency Equivalents) Order sets the equivalent of

250 francs at $49.58.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. After the shortfall in delivery was discovered the defendant requested for the

packing details of the transceivers and they received a revised invoice showing 8 cartons of 112

transceivers and 1 carton of 104 transceivers. By the defendants description "(t)hese 9

cartons were packed into a pallet using shrink polyethylene sheet. The shrink polyethylene sheet is

a thin plastic sheet. This is to keep the cartons together as they belonged to the same owner for

ease of handling in accordance with standard industry practice." The sheet was damaged, and 4

cartons containing 440 transceivers were missing. The total weight of those 4 cartons was 60

kilogrammes.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The parties disagreed over whether in applying Article 22(2)(b) the

compensation was to be limited on the basis of 1 package of 154 kilogrammes as the plaintiff

contends, or 4 packages of a total 60 kilogrammes according to the defendant. If it is the former,

the compensation payable is $7,635.32 but by the latter, it is $2,974.80.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The question went before a deputy registrar who held that compensation should

be computed on the latter basis. The plaintiff appealed against the decision to a district judge and

failed. The matter came before me on appeal from the district judges decision, and I allowed the

appeal. The matter is now to go to the Court of Appeal as I gave leave to the defendant to appeal

against my decision so that the issues can be decided at the highest level.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The main issue I had to decide is whether the consignment is to be regarded as

1 package or 9 packages. For the defendant, it was argued that</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(A)lthough Air Waybill mentioned only 1 pallet, they are allowed to produce

  evidence of details of packaging of the goods. In other words, the Defendants are entitled to

  introduce evidence of the 9 cartons even though the air waybill did not mention the 9 cartons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The next issue is the validity of the defendants complaint that the

plaintiffs claim is unjust because</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Article 22 is compensatory provision. It is not intended to unjustly benefit

  the Plaintiffs. Where only part of the cargo is lost, the Defendants are entitled to bring

  evidence to show the weight of the lost cargo.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The number of packages</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. The convention does not define a package, but there is little doubt over what

may constitute a package. A receptacle like a box, a carton, or a pallet can be a package. If a

consignment consists of an item in a box, the box is a package. If a consignment consists of a

carton holding an item, the carton is a package, and if the consignment is a pallet holding an item,

the pallet is a package. Differences of opinions arise where these receptacles are combined, e.g.

where a consignment is made up of a pallet formed by 5 cartons, each containing 10 boxes. In this

situation, there cannot, for the purposes of Article 22(2) be at the same time 1 pallet-package, 5

carton-packages and 50 box-packages.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. This problem arises in all modes of carriage of goods. In carriage by sea the

same issue has given rise to the views and treatments referred to in Lord Justice Phillips

comprehensive review of the issues in connection with the Hague Rules in <i>The "River Gurara"

</i>[1998] 1 Ll LR 225.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. For the carriage of goods by air coming within the convention, assistance is

provided by Article 11(2) which states that</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b>
<p align="justify">The statements in the air waybill relating to</p></b> the weight, dimensions and

  packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to <b>the number of packages</b>, <b>are</b> <b><i>prima

  facie</i> evidence</b> <b>of the facts stated</b>; those relating to the quantity, volume and

  condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both

  have been and are stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the

  consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo. (Emphasis added)

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. This provision gives the parties, especially the consignor who prepares the

air waybill, the discretion to decide how the number of packages for a particular consignment is to

be reckoned. It is not the consignors sole discretion because the carrier can have a say on it

before it accepts the consignment for carriage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. Once the number of packages is fixed and stated in the air waybill, that is <i>prima

facie</i> the number of packages for the purpose of the convention. As long as the number stated is

a correct figure, it will apply. In the example used the number of packages could be stated as 1

(for pallets), 5 (for cartons), or 50 (for boxes). Each of them will be the operative number of

packages when it is stated in the waybill. The number stated is not conclusive if it is not correct,

e.g. if it is stated as 3 in the example given, reflecting neither the number of pallets, cartons

nor boxes.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. The defendant submitted that evidence of the 9 cartons can be adduced

although it was not stated in the waybill, citing <i>Yusen Air &amp; Sea Service (S) Pte Ltd v.

Changi International Airport Services Pte Ltd </i><nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 135</nobr> where the Court of Appeal held

that the weight on an waybill can be rebutted with proper evidence. That applies to all <i>prima

facie</i> evidence and reflects the essential character of <i>prima facie</i> evidence. The question

here is not whether the <i>prima facie</i> evidence can be rebutted, but whether it is .</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. The defendant accepts that the consignment was in a pallet consisting of 9

cartons holding 1,000 transceivers. The number of packages could be taken to be 1, 9 and arguably

1,000 if the transceivers were packed in individual boxes. When it was stated as 1 in the waybill,

it was a proper description. If it was stated as 9, that would also be proper, but it did not

happen. The defendant is now obliged by Article 11(2) to acknowledge that the number of packages was

correctly stated as 1.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Unjust benefit to the plaintiff</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. Counsel for the defendant placed considerable reliance on the argument that

it is impermissible and unjust to use the full weight of a consignment in quantifying the

compensation when only a part of the consignment is lost.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. This argument arises from a fallacy. Article 22(2) sets the limit to the

compensation payable. It says that for lost, damaged or delayed cargo, the compensation shall not

exceed 250 francs per kilogramme of the package or packages concerned. It does not fix the

compensation at 250 francs per kilogramme of the package or packages lost, damaged or delayed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. Article 22 does not enable a consignee to recover more than its loss. If a

consignee suffered a loss of 1,000 francs as a result of the loss, damage or delay of its goods in a

consignment of 50 kilogrammes, it cannot recover 12,500 francs. The most it can recover is 1,000

francs, and less if the compensation is reduced by limitation. This is evident in the present case.

The value of the lost transceivers is US$74,360. The plaintiff limits its claim to $7,635.32, while

the defendant contends that it should be limited to $2,974.80. The defendant may argue that the

plaintiffs claim is subject to a lower limitation (if the number of packages is taken as 9), but

it is overstating the case to complain that the claim would result in an unjust benefit to the

plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. While dealing with this complaint, it should also be noted that the weight of

consignment lost, damaged or delayed is not used in the computation under Article 22(2)(b) which

provides for "the total weight of the package or packages concerned" to be taken into

consideration. Where a package is partially lost, damaged or delayed, the total weight of that

package is taken into account. If that is unjust, it arises from Article 22(2)(b) itself.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. Counsel for the defendant also argued that the</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Plaintiffs claim is only for part of the cargo.  (T)hey proceeded under

  Article 22(2)(b). If the Plaintiffs claim is for the whole of the cargo, they would have

  proceeded under Article 22(2)(a). It is submitted that they recognise there is a difference

  between losing the whole cargo and part of the cargo and the 2 situations must be treated

  differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. I do not think that it is a correct reading of Article 22(2) that sub-article

(2)(a) applies to claims for total loss and sub-article (2)(b) applies to claims for partial loss.

On my reading, sub-article (2)(a) sets the monetary limit by weight to claims for total as well as

partial loss, damage or delay. Sub-article (2)(b) sets out the basis on which monetary limit is to

be computed. It states that for partial damage, loss or delay, the total weight of the package

concerned is taken into account, but it does not refer to claims arising from total loss, damage or

delay in which the total weight of the package must apply. Put another way, there is a need to refer

to claims for partial loss, damage or delay to remove any doubt whether the partial or full weight

should apply, but there is no need to refer to total loss, damage or delay where there is no

uncertainty over that. Like sub-article 2(a), it applies to total and partial loss, damage or delay.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. Counsel for the defendant also cited <i>Bland v British Airways Board</i>

[1981] 1 Ll LR 289 where Lord Denning in discussing the convention held at page 290</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Article 22(2)(a) covers the case when the <i>whole </i>of a persons baggage

  is lost. I need not deal with that. But art.22(2)(b) covers the case when only <i>part</i> of the

  baggage is lost. That article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case of loss, damage or delay of <i>part</i> of registered baggage 

    the amounts to which the carriers liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the

    package or packages concerned. (Emphasis supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">So it depends on the weight of the "package concerned". Compensation

  depends on the number of kilogrammes you have lost.</p></i> (Emphasis added)

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. I humbly repeat my views on the application of Article 22(2). In any event,

the effect is the same. As the judge pointed out, the limitation to the carriers liability (and

the consignees entitlement) is set by reference to the weight of the package concerned (not the

weight of the lost, damaged or delayed part of the package) whereas the compensation is measured by

the weight of the lost, damaged or delayed part thereof. This applies equally to claims for total

and partial loss.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. The plaintiffs full loss is US$74,360. Its claim under Article 22(2) is

for $7,635.32. The plaintiffs claim was properly made on the basis that the consignment was in

one package. There is no unjust benefit in the sense that the compensation sought exceeds the loss

incurred. The plaintiffs appeal was allowed for these reasons.</p>
