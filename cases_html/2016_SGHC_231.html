Financial support is irrelevant unless there was an obligation to provide this support: <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> (at [30]). Financial support which may or may not be given by the provider, at its sole discretion, is meaningless in this context. I would add that it seems to me that the effect of financial support on the company’s solvency status would also depend on whether the support was given by way of an equity injection or a loan. However, this point was not argued before me and I would leave its determination for some future case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the present case, there was no evidence that CCMG and SCPL were legally bound to provide financial support to the Company.

</div> I disagreed. The argument involved an untenable leap in logic. Giving a guarantee to third parties was one way that CCMG provided financial support to the Company.

It was also not disputed that the defendant was an associate of the Company either because she was Liew’s spouse or because she was Lawrence’s sister, both Liew and Lawrence being directors of the Company at the time the Payments were made. Therefore, the statutory presumption under s 99(5) of the BA applied in this case. The burden was on the defendant to rebut the presumption. To rebut the presumption, the defendant had to show that the Payments were not <span class="font-italic">influenced at all</span> by any desire on the Company’s part to place her in a preferential position: <span class="font-italic">Liquidators of Progen</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd </span>[2010] 4 SLR 1089 at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The defendant first submitted that the Company’s directors honestly believed in February 2014 that the Company could continue as a going concern.

First, Liew’s statement published on 27 January 2014 was in relation to CCMG and not the Company. In addition, the statement was made in response to rumours of CCMG going down. In my view, the statement could not be given much weight in the circumstances. Second, the $3m Loan was not given to the Company. Instead, it was given to CCMG.

</div> The fact that the funds were deposited into the Company’s account could only mean that it was a loan by CCMG to the Company.

The Company was clearly balance sheet as well as cash flow insolvent and there was no binding obligation on CCMG to provide financial support to the Company to ensure that all of the Company’s debts would be paid. Even Guan Chuan’s progress claim of $238,450.69 issued in January 2014 went unpaid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The defendant next submitted that there was no intention to prefer because there was a genuine commercial reason for the Payments.

</div> It was patently clear that no part of the $3m Loan was segregated for the specific purpose of repaying the defendant. In fact, the full amount of $3m had been withdrawn from the UOB Account well before the three cheques were issued to the defendant on 14 February 2014.          </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Third, I found the defendant’s explanation for the Payments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to consolidate the debts under Liew’s name) hard to believe given the circumstances of the case. There was no compelling reason to consolidate the debts owed to her under Liew’s name just because she had resigned.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For completeness, I would add that the defendant also asserted that the Company had issued two earlier cheques in June or July 2013 to her for the total amount of $500,000. Her evidence was that she had overlooked these earlier cheques before they expired and the two cheques issued to her in February 2014 for the total amount of $500,000 (see [8] above) were replacements for the cheques originally issued in 2013.

</div> In my view, this point was neither here nor there. Even if it was true, this explanation did not constitute a commercial justification for the Company to prefer the defendant ahead of its other unsecured creditors by making the Payments in February 2014. The defendant was not even pressing the Company for payment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the funds used to make the Payments were held under a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quistclose</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> trust?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Finally, the defendant submitted that as Liew had informed the Company that of the $3m Loan, $1m was to be set aside to be used to pay the defendant, the $1m was subject to an express <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust.

</div> it must also be sufficiently certain that the settlor-donor intended to constitute the recipient as a trustee, and conferred a power or duty on the recipient-trustee to apply the money exclusively in accordance with the stated purpose (<span class="font-italic">AHPETC</span> at [114(c)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my judgment, this defence was an afterthought and a non-starter. First, the evidence as to how the $3m Loan was dealt with proved that no trust could have been created (see [44] above). There was no certainty of subject matter as the $1m was mixed with the Company’s other funds in the UOB Account, without any segregation. Further, the whole of the $3m Loan was fully withdrawn by the end of 28 January 2014 when the UOB Account went into overdraft. Hence, there was no connection between the $3m Loan and the actual monies disbursed to the defendant after the three cheques issued to her were cleared for payment on 20 March 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Second, CCMG’s public announcement issued on 22 January 2014 contradicted Liew’s alleged intention to subject $1m to a trust. In that announcement, CCMG clearly stated that the $3m Loan was an interest-free loan to CCMG and that the loan “will be used for general working capital of the Company’s construction business”.
