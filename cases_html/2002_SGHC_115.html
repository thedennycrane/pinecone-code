</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1. The Plaintiffs’ claim against the First and the Second

Defendants is for damages, a declaration that they are entitled to an indemnity from the

Defendants in respect of the whole or part of any sums which the Plaintiffs have paid or

may be held liable to pay or may reasonably agree to pay to Hong Kong United Dockyard Ltd

("HUD") and in respect of their own costs in defending the arbitration

proceedings brought by HUD and the costs of this action to the extent found to be just and

equitable, interest and costs. 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The Plaintiffs are shipbuilders and repairers. The First Defendants

are manufacturers and suppliers of marine paints marketed under the "Courtaulds"

and "International" trademarks owned by the Second Defendants. The First

Defendants are wholly owned by the Second Defendants, a company incorporated in the United

Kingdom.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. In July 1993, the Plaintiffs agreed to build a 40,000 tonne floating

dock for HUD for US$40.5 million. The floating dock was constructed in four separate

modules at three locations in Singapore. Two modules were built at the Plaintiffs’

Pioneer Yard at 50, Gul Road, one was constructed at the Plaintiffs’ Main Yard at 31

Shipyard Road and the fourth one was built at the Singmarine Shipyard also at Gul Road.

The floating dock was christened "The United" and was delivered to HUD on 9

January 1995.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The paints for the steel surfaces of the floating dock were supplied

by the First Defendants. These protective coatings included shop-primer (Interplate

NEA408/NEA409), holding primer (Intergard EGA088/089 Red) and coat tar epoxy (Intertuf

JJA485/JJA486 and Intertuf JJA484/JJA486).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. In July 1993, in response to the Plaintiffs’ request, the First

Defendants sent a quotation for the supply of paints for the construction of the floating

dock. The Plaintiffs then asked for a further quotation based on a paint scheme provided

by them. The paint scheme had the following specifications :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"2.7 PAINTING</p>
<p align="justify">General<br/>

  The paint throughout the dock to be of marine type approved by Buyer.<br/>

  All painting work to be executed in accordance with good marine practice and paint

  manufacturer’s recommendation.</p>

<p>Inspection of the film thickness<br/>

  (1) General</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Each dry film thickness to be measured after painting for the areas

    specified, at Buyer’s discretion. Any area found to be of insufficient thickness to

    be given an additional coating to meet the specified thickness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>2.9 CATHODIC PROTECTION</p>
<p align="justify">In order to protect the external surface of the caisson below the

  working draft, cathodic protection of the impressed current type is to be installed.

  Painting specification to be made available to manufacturer for the design of the cathodic

  system.</p>
<p align="justify">Suitable epoxy coating to be applied in the vicinity of anodes.</p>
<p>Sacrificial anodes to be provided in all water ballast tanks."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. After the First Defendants submitted their final price list and

painting specifications, the Plaintiffs placed various orders for the supply of marine

coatings for the floating dock. The contracts for the sale and purchase of the said paints

and the technical support for the proper use of the paints were contained in the

Plaintiffs’ Purchase Orders ("PO") from November 1993 to July 1994 to the

First Defendants. The POs were printed and contained the following typewritten General

Terms and Conditions :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"5) you (ie the First Defendants) are to provide a full time

  technical representative on site throughout the project at no charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p>7)    Normal warranty to apply twelve (12) months guarantee."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">On the reverse side of the POs, there appeared the following printed

terms and conditions :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"7. Warranty</p>
<p align="justify">(The First Defendants) warrant that all goods and services covered by

  this Purchase Order will conform to quantity and quality specifications, drawings, samples

  merchantable, of good material and workmanship and free from all defects and that goods

  which are the product of (the First Defendants’) specifications will be fit and

  sufficient for the use intended."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The painting specifications of the First Defendants dated 12 October

1993 required all surfaces which would be painted to be blasted to Swedish Standard SA 2.5

followed by the application of one coat of iron oxide epoxy shop primer (Interplate

NEA408/NEA409). They also required the internal bulkheads and the external side walls of

the ballast tanks from the caisson to full loaded draft to be power tool cleaned of all

rusted, damaged and welded areas to Swedish Standard SA 2.5, followed by the application

of one coat of Intertuf JJA484/JJA486 coat tar epoxy (brown) at 250 microns dry film

thickness ("DFT") for the internal bulkheads and 190 microns DFT for the

external side walls. The specifications also stated :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"General</p>
<p align="justify">Where there is oil and grease, remove it with international GMA627

  emulsifiable degreaser. High pressure freshwater wash 3,000 psi to remove the emulsified

<p align="justify">Allow surface to dry thoroughly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The First Defendants’ product data sheet for their coal tar

epoxy had the following information under "Surface Preparation" :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Primed shop surface</p>
<p align="justify">Intertuf high solids tar epoxy is compatible with most shop primers. If

  in doubt about a particular shop primer, contact local IP Technical Department for advice.

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. In June 1995, HUD informed the Plaintiffs that there were defects in

the coating of the internal bulkheads of the ballast tanks of the floating dock. Between

11 and 16 August 1995, a joint inspection of 15 ballast tanks was conducted by the

representatives of the Plaintiffs, the First Defendants and HUD. There were blisters in

the paint coating of the internal ballast tanks. The First Defendants’ Technical

Manager, Mathew Brown, stated in his report that there was sound argument in recommending

no repair work be done. He was of the view that the area affected by blisters was only

about 1% of the tanks and that equipment necessary to do any repair could lead to

mechanical damage of the unaffected coating system. Further, he thought the blisters (of

mainly 3 to 5 mm in diameter) were relatively small and contained an alkaline solution (pH

14) which would protect the steel from corroding. The examination of the steel beneath the

blisters indicated no corrosion and unless the blisters were broken, the coating would

still protect the steel. Mathew Brown went on to say that the experience of the First

Defendants showed that such blisters stabilized in the first six months and the coating

could continue to protect the steel surface for many years unless the blisters were

deliberately broken. He recommended that the condition of the tanks be monitored every six

months to see if the blister size/density was changing. That would be preferable to

risking damage to the unaffected 99% of the coating and would result in no interference

with the operation of the floating dock.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Between 16 and 18 February 1996, a second joint inspection of the

ballast tank coating was conducted. The First Defendants’ representatives reported

that the extent of the blistering had not increased significantly since August 1995 but

that a few minor areas, which were in the initial stages of corroding at the time of the

first inspection, had worsened and were more obvious at the second inspection. As the

tanks were drier at the second inspection, more areas of corrosion could be seen. They

felt that since the blistering/corrosion had not increased in area over the last six

months, the extent of the area affected had probably reached a maximum. Blister fluid was

shown to have a value of pH 13 and the steel beneath the intact blisters was not

corroding. They recommended that the areas of repair be limited to those areas which had a

density and size higher than 2 according to ISO 4628/2 : 1982 (E) and where the corrosion

had reached a severity greater than Ri 2 according to ISO 4628/3 : 1982 (E) Part 3 :

Designation of degree of rusting. Some bays of the ballast tanks would require staging for

access but such staging should be kept to a minimum to minimize the risk of mechanical

damage. They further recommended that each defined area of blistering be marked out, the

blisters be broken by scraping and the areas be then washed thoroughly with high pressure

freshwater which should remove any loosely adhering coating, soluble salts and fluid from

the broken blisters.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. A trial repair was agreed and carried out in bay 10 of number 7

port wing tank sometime in October 1996. The trial repair involved the slicing of

blisters, high pressure washing, feathering of the edges and a touch up of the affected

areas followed by the application of one coat of vinyl tar (JVA075).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. By late 1997, however, blisters were seen in all 28 tanks of the

floating dock and the owners, HUD, decided that it should be decommissioned for repair

works. Tenders were called for and on 24 October 1997, the repair contract was awarded by

HUD to Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard with the First Defendants supplying some of the paints

needed for the repairs. On 1 December 1997, the floating dock was towed from Hong Kong

where it was operating to the said shipyard in mainland China.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. There the ballast tanks were cleaned and grit blasted to SA 2.5 up

to a height of 6 metres, with HUD reserving their right to repair above the 6 metre mark.

Two coats of coal tar epoxy were then applied. The total area of the internal bulkheads of

the ballast tanks involved was some 111,152 square metres. The areas which were not

blasted were touched up and given one coating of vinyl tar. Repairs were also effected to

the external underwater coating. However, no repair was carried out in bay 10 of number 7

port wing tank where the trial repair was done. The floating dock returned to Hong Kong

around 11 March 1998. The Plaintiffs’ insurers had a representative (Capt Clay Wild)

and his assistants to witness the repair works for the entire period the floating dock was

in Guangzhou.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. On 5 January 1996, HUD served formal notice under clause 11 of the

Building Contract they had with the Plaintiffs, alleging various defects in the paintwork

said to have been caused by inadequate surface preparation and/or low DFT. On 19 July

1999, HUD commenced arbitration proceedings against the Plaintiffs in London. HUD claimed

a further sum of HK$24,907,292.49 as costs of the repairs and a declaration that the

Plaintiffs were liable to pay the further costs of rectifying the continuing defects in

the coating in the ballast tanks.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. On 29 April 2000, the Plaintiffs, upon counsel’s advice,

entered into a settlement agreement with HUD for the sum of US$7,550,000. The settlement

amount included the following :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(1)    HK$44,563,915.49 (about US$5,734,400) as the costs of repairs to

  the internal bulkheads and the external hull of the ballast tanks ;</p>
<p>(2)    US$2,547,000 as the estimated costs of further repairs to the

  ballast tank coatings after the date of settlement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. The Plaintiffs also incurred GBP59,317.06 in legal costs in the

arbitration proceedings in London.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    The Plaintiffs claimed in this action that the blisters in the

paint coating were caused by invisible soluble salts deposited on the steel surfaces

during the primary surface preparation stage when the steel plates were blasted in the

Plaintiffs’ auto-blaster shop. Alternatively or in addition to the salt contamination

during the shop process, such contamination occurred after fabrication when the steel

surfaces were swept-blasted to prepare them for the final coat. Such contamination, the

Plaintiffs contended, would have been eliminated if the First Defendants had given

instructions for the steel surfaces to be cleaned by means of high pressure freshwater

washing before blasting at both stages of surface preparation and the First Defendants

were under a duty to advise the Plaintiffs on such technical aspects of the paint system

by virtue of clause 5 in the POs. It was accepted by the First Defendants that they were

aware of the risk of contamination by invisible soluble salts during the construction

process. The First Defendants had, in breach of their duty, specified the need for high

pressure freshwater washing only where there was oil and grease on the steel surfaces. As

a result of their reliance on the First Defendants’ specifications and advice, the

Plaintiffs incurred the aforesaid liability to HUD.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    Alternatively, the Plaintiffs alleged that the marine coatings

supplied were not reasonably fit for use in the ballast tanks and the external hull if the

defects were caused by cathodic blistering as contended by the First Defendants. This was

because the coal tar epoxy had been stated to be an ideal choice for immersed steel.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    Their claim against the Second Defendants was for breach of duty

as the manufacturers of the paints supplied. The Second Defendants caused or permitted the

use of their trademarks on paints sold by the First Defendants and were therefore liable

as they had held themselves out as the manufacturers even if they were not.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    The First Defendants were of the view that the blisters were

caused by low DFT. If they were caused by inadequate steel surface preparation, that was

not the responsibility of the First Defendants but of the Plaintiffs. They claimed that

their paint or technical representatives were on site to carry out DFT checks on the steel

surfaces with the representatives of the Plaintiffs and of HUD whenever the Plaintiffs

indicated readiness for such inspection. They denied that the coal tar epoxy supplied was

not fit for the purposes of the floating dock and that even if it was found to be unfit,

their liability was limited by contract to the supply of free replacement paint to the

Plaintiffs. In any event, they said, the Plaintiffs and HUD failed to mitigate their loss.

In the event that they were found to be liable to the Plaintiffs and their claim to the

limited liability failed, the First Defendants counterclaimed for the sum of S$355,852,

the cost of the paint supplied to the Plaintiffs for the repairs in the shipyard in China,

interest and costs.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    The Second Defendants denied that they were the manufacturers of

the paints in question or their components or that they owed the Plaintiffs any duty. They

asserted in any event that the paints were reasonably fit for use on the floating dock.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    The Plaintiffs relied essentially on the evidence of their expert

witness, Kirt Smith, who testified that the most likely cause of the blisters in the paint

coating was the presence of invisible soluble salts on the steel surfaces after blasting.

Kirt Smith went on board the floating dock in Hong Kong in June 1997 to investigate the

cause of the defects and to make recommendations for repair. He submitted a report on 28

July 1997. He was of the opinion that the blisters were caused by osmotic blistering which

was the absorption of water by a coating and the formation of blisters where water soluble

contaminants were present under the coated surface. Such contaminants could be dirt or

salts left on the steel during surface preparation prior to painting. Where such water

soluble contaminants were trapped under the coating, the thinner coating areas

demonstrated increased blistering as these required less time to absorb water to the

substrate surface and the coating itself was more flexible, thus allowing blisters to form

more readily.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    Kirt Smith’s finding that there was soluble salt

contamination was supported by a report from HUD which mentioned the presence of large

quantities of salt under the coating system. He testified further that invisible soluble

salts could only be removed by washing with water.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    It appeared from the evidence of all the paint representatives of

the First Defendants who were on site in the three shipyards where fabrication was taking

place that there was no need to do washing of new steel unless there was visible dirt or

other contaminants such as oil and grease. Some of them were of the view that blasting

could remove salt from the steel surface. They testified that their duty was essentially

to check the quality of the blasting of the steel surfaces and the DFT after the relevant

paint had been applied at the respective stages. This was done with representatives of the

Plaintiffs as well as those of HUD. There was a methodology in the random samples to be

taken by the three representatives. It was plainly impossible that every square centimetre

of paint be measured.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    It was the opinion of the First Defendants’ Managing

Director, Colin Tan, that while it was possible to have invisible salt contamination on

new steel, the fact that it was invisible meant that it was of a very low concentration.

This, he said, was corroborated by the Bressler patch test on salt contamination that the

First Defendants performed in Singapore during the course of the trial. Rain could also

wash off the salt on the steel surfaces. He was of the view that salt contamination was

not possible in an auto-blasting chamber where the steel used was new steel. There was no

need to wash new steel where there was no visible contamination on the surface. He added

that shop blasting plants in Taiwan did washing of steel plates because they were close to

the coast and the steel plates could get contaminated in a typhoon. He accepted that the

paint industry, including the First Defendants, was aware of the risk of invisible salt

contamination at the material time.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    One of the expert witnesses of the First Defendants was Dr Paul

Philpot, who was one of the First Defendants’ representatives at the second

inspection of the floating dock in February 1996. He did not dispute the HUD report’s

finding that there were large quantities of salt under the paint coating. His opinion was

that low DFT of the paint was the cause of the problem. That meant that the Plaintiffs had

not applied the requisite thickness of paint to the steel surfaces. In his testimony in

court, Dr Philpot mentioned for the first time the theory of cathodic disbondment as the

probable cause of the blisters. He asserted that it was not something new that he was

bringing up in court but that the theory was mere elaboration of what he meant by low DFT

being the cause of the problem.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    Dr Philpot explained that corrosion would begin in areas where

there was low DFT. An anodic reaction would take place at the corrosion areas leading to a

cathodic reaction elsewhere which would cause blistering. If they contained salts, there

would have been corrosion evidenced by black spots. However, the blisters showed no sign

of corrosion. One of the effects of cathodic blistering was that there would be loss of

adhesion at the interface between the steel surface and the paint coating. This reaction

was termed cathodic disbondment. It would also cause "creep" back to an anode.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    The Plaintiffs submitted that Dr Philpot, being a director of the

Second Defendants, could not be regarded as a truly independent expert witness. They

argued that his theory was an afterthought and was at odds with the known facts of the

case. It contradicted the report of HUD’s expert who stated that there was severe

osmotic blistering caused by the high concentration of salts under the coating system

which indicated that the salts were present before the coat tar epoxy was applied.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Kirt Smith was recalled to respond to this theory. He gave the

following four reasons for disagreeing with the opinion that the blisters were cathodic

rather than osmotic :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(1)    for cathodic blistering to have occurred, there must be areas of

  corrosion within 2 to 3 cm of, and not more than 10 cm away from, the blisters. He found

  widespread blistering with no corresponding pattern of corrosion. The rust stains in the

  photographs highlighted by the First Defendants in cross-examination did not represent

  corrosion areas ;</p>
<p>(2)    the blisters were not in a circular pattern which was typical of

  cathodic blistering ;</p>
<p>(3)    cathodic blistering was progressive and would not stabilize. The

  blisters in this case, in the opinion of the First Defendants’ representatives, had

  stabilized ;</p>
<p>(4)    the coating used was supposed to be ideal for cathodic protection

  and therefore was resistant to cathodic blistering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">He added that oxygen was necessary for corrosion to take place and

oxygen was not sufficiently present in the blisters because it would not pass through the

coating membrane quite so quickly. That explained the absence of corrosion in the

blisters. There was also no correlation between DFT and blistering as there were blisters

in areas of high DFT and some areas of low DFT did not produce blisters.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    Another of the First Defendants’ expert witnesses, Trevor

Jones, discussed the possibility of osmotic blistering in his evidence but made no mention

of cathodic blisters. Trevor Jones pointed out that the block method of construction used

by the Plaintiffs had a higher potential for coating failure as the shop primer steel

could be allowed to weather in a corrosive marine atmosphere before painting and soluble

salts could form on the surface which could then lead to osmotic blistering.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    Looking at the evidence in totality, I found on a balance of

probabilities that the blistering was osmotic rather than cathodic in nature and that it

was due to salt being present before the paint was applied. I accepted the evidence of

Kirt Smith as the more credible and logical opinion as to the cause of the blistering

problem. It was the duty of the First Defendants to ensure that a proper paint system was

in place and that included proper surface preparation without which the paint coating

would be doomed from the beginning. The First Defendants failed in their duty. They

acknowledged that the Plaintiffs were working in a marine environment. It would not

require a typhoon to deposit salt in coastal areas. The First Defendants were aware of the

risk of invisible salt contamination but took no steps to test for the presence of salt on

the steel surfaces or to advise the Plaintiffs to do high pressure freshwater washing

before the steel plates were blasted. Their specifications clearly contemplated washing

only where there was visible contamination like oil and grease. The testimony of their

paint/technical representatives also showed this was the indisputable meaning to be given

to the specifications concerning washing. They did not and would not have advised the

Plaintiffs to do the washing when they quite plainly ought to have done so.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    Having come to this conclusion, it followed that the fault did

not lie in the paints supplied and that there was therefore no need to consider the case

against the Second Defendants any further. There was no evidence to rebut that of the

Second Defendants in any event that they were not the manufacturers of the paints in

question or their components.</p>
<p xmlns="">33.    I now consider the extent to which the First Defendants should be

held accountable to the Plaintiffs. Colin Tan testified on the meaning of the "normal

warranty to apply twelve (12) months guarantee" referred to in the aforesaid clause 7

of the General Terms and Conditions in the Plaintiffs’ POs. He said a warranty for

free paint replacement only would be unwritten whereas one for free paint replacement

coupled with labour costs would be in the form of a signed written agreement. This was the

understanding, he said, between the Plaintiffs and the First Defendants who had a

longstanding relationship. In this case, it was accepted that there was no signed warranty

or performance guarantee. Accordingly, the First Defendants argued that their liability,

if any, would be limited to the replacement of paint which had already been supplied for

the repairs.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    Insofar as the First Defendants were attempting to rely on the

previous course of dealing to support their understanding of the said clause, that was not

borne out by the evidence. There did not appear to have been any such "normal

warranty" indicated by Colin Tan. I therefore did not think that their liability was

limited in the way contended. In any case, such a warranty as contended by the First

Defendants would only apply if the fault lay in the paints supplied and, as I have

indicated above, it was not the paint that caused the blistering. The First Defendants

also contended that if they should be found liable and their liability was not limited to

the supply of the replacement paint, then they should succeed in their Counterclaim for

the price of the replacement paint. As will appear at the end of this judgment, I held

that if the replacement paint had not been supplied, HUD would have included such an

amount in their total claim against the Plaintiffs. The First Defendants therefore failed

in their Counterclaim for its price.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    HUD did not proceed with the repair method suggested by the First

Defendants which was said to be the cheaper method. HUD’s representative was called

by the Plaintiffs to testify and he said that if HUD adopted the method suggested by the

First Defendants, the repairs would take an indefinitely long time and HUD would not know

when and where blisters would next appear. Each time repairs became necessary, HUD would

have to decommission their floating dock. HUD was also of the view that the trial repair

in bay 10 of tank number 7 port wing using the First Defendants’ preferred method did

not solve the problem. The blistering was serious and widespread and they rejected the

notion of having limited spot repairs.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.    In the course of the trial, a purported faxed quotation dated 6

May 1998 from a company called Jurong Clavon Pte Ltd was produced in evidence by Colin Tan

which indicated that the company was willing to do the blasting and painting repairs for

the floating dock in Singapore at the much lower cost of US$10 psm. This fax was not

disclosed in discovery apparently on the advice of the First Defendants’ solicitors.

In my opinion, this so-called quotation was of little value anyway as the company’s

representative was not called to testify and to give further details about other relevant

aspects which would have an important bearing on the costs, in particular, the length of

time needed and the much higher costs in towage and insurance charges if the floating dock

were to return to Singapore for repairs. HUD would not have accepted the proposed spot

repair instead of full re-blasting at any rate.</p>
<p xmlns="">37.    The Plaintiffs were satisfied from Capt Clay Wild’s reports

that the costs of the repairs in Guangzhou were reasonable. They had also verified with

him the cost estimates of the future repairs put up by HUD and were satisfied that they

were reasonable. They therefore accepted the estimates. They did their sums and concluded

that their maximum liability would be in the region of US$10 million while HUD’s

reasonable claim for the repairs and the future repairs would be around US$9 million. </p>
<p xmlns="">38.    The Plaintiffs engaged Ince &amp; Co and counsel in London for

the purposes of the arbitration proceedings there. </p>
<p xmlns="">39.    In my opinion, the Plaintiffs did whatever could reasonably have

been expected of them in mitigating the damages they would have to pay as a result of the

paint fiasco. We should not weigh in nice scales the measures taken by a sufferer from a

breach of contract to extricate himself (<i>Banco De Portugal v Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd</i>

[1932] AC 452 at 506). A party which has breached its contractual duty to another could

hardly be expected to dictate terms, especially those which do not appear to be

reasonable, to the party suffering the consequences of the breach. Even if the repainting

appeared to the First Defendants to be "extensive and expensive", the Plaintiffs

certainly did not go about the repairs and subsequently the settlement agreement in a

cavalier and carefree fashion in the way a less conscientious party, intending to dump all

the consequences down the line to another, would have done. They made sure that HUD’s

repairs and demands for future costs of repairs were reasonable. They did their sums. They

took legal advice. It is always tempting to reproach a party which has settled a claim on

why he did not settle much earlier and thus save on legal and arbitration fees. There

should be some latitude given to parties for reasonable posturing and for time to

reconsider the strengths and the weaknesses of their case, especially in a situation like

the present where millions of dollars are at stake. </p>
<p xmlns="">40.    The First Defendants also argued that it was "excessive and

unreasonable" for the Plaintiffs to seek to pass on a loss of more than US$7 million

to them when the contract between the parties was worth less than S$1 million. In my view,

the situation was no different from a petrol station supplying $50 of defective petrol to

a Rolls Royce and causing extensive damage to the luxury car’s engine. The petrol

station owner will not be able to contend that he should not be made to pay damages which

amount to so many times more than the paltry $50 of petrol supplied. </p>
<p xmlns="">41.    The Plaintiffs were not obliged to inform the First Defendants of

all the steps taken in the arbitration proceedings or of the negotiations as the First

Defendants never accepted liability in full or in part for the blisters in the paint

coating.</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    In the result, I gave judgment for the Plaintiffs against the

First Defendants with costs and interest at 6% per annum on the aggregate amount due from

the date of the writ to the date of payment. I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim

against the Second Defendants with costs. I dismissed the First Defendants’

Counterclaim with costs. The computation of the amount of damages eventually awarded to

the Plaintiffs appears in the notes of evidence which I repeat below. The amount of

US$225,630 was deducted from the amount of the settlement agreement as that related to the

repair of the bilge pump and had nothing to do with the breach by the First Defendants. I

also deducted the amounts attributable to the external hull coating damage as it appeared

that a claim in respect of this had not been notified by HUD to the Plaintiffs within the

12 month period after delivery of the floating dock provided for in the Building Contract.

The Plaintiffs were therefore not liable to HUD in respect of this, as pleaded by them in

the arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p xmlns="">43.    The following is reproduced from the notes of evidence at the

time I saw counsel for the parties in chambers in order to work out the aggregate amount
