<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This was an appeal from the decision of district judge Wong Choon Ning

("the judge"), when she convicted the appellant of an offence under s 146 of the Penal

Code (Cap 224) and acquitted him of another offence under the same section. The appellant was

sentenced to 54 months imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The appellant appealed against

conviction and sentence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The charge</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The first charge against the appellant was irrelevant for the purposes of this

appeal and references thereto will be omitted here. The second charge, DAC 38920/2000, read as

follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">You,</p>

</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></i> 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i>The evidence of the prosecution</i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The story that emerged from the prosecution witnesses was as follows. On 6

March 1999, the victim, Rajandran Balasundram ("PW5"), who was a police officer, and his

friends, Vailthilingam Mani Vannan ("PW1") and Shanmugam s/o Ganesan ("PW2")

went to Dunlop Street for a late supper, but parked their cars at Madras Street. About 2.30 am on 7

March 1999, they walked back to Madras Street. The Back Alley Pub ("the pub") had just

closed and its clientele had spilled out onto the street.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 Outside the pub, PW1 and PW2 were confronted by a large group of Indian men.

One of them slapped PW1. On seeing this, PW5 told his friends to leave and he stayed behind to try

to defuse the situation. While speaking to this group of men, PW5 was set upon by another group of

Indian men. The first group left. PW5 was kicked by the second group, punched and hit with

motorcycle helmets. This was the first incident of assault on PW5, but it was not pertinent to the

appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 When someone shouted that the police were coming, three of PW5s assailants

fled, taking him with them. PW5 said that he was too weak to resist. They took him to an isolated

area behind Sim Lim Tower. On the way, they passed pedestrians and vehicles, but PW5 did not attempt

to escape because he knew he could not outrun the men; nor did he shout for help, for fear of

reprisals.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 A few minutes later, four or five Indian men (including the appellant) joined

them. They took PW5s wallet, and hence were able to ascertain where he lived and worked. They

slapped and interrogated him. They also threatened to harm his family should he report the incident

to the police. This continued for about an hour. During this time, PW5 was bleeding profusely from

the injuries he had suffered in the first assault. One of the men guarded PW5 to ensure that he did

not see their faces, but PW5 said he managed to steal several glances at three men, including the

appellant. Finally, one of the men drove PW5s car from Madras Street to Sim Lim Tower and PW5 was

allowed to leave in his car.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 PW5 went home immediately to ensure that his family was safe. He then went to

the hospital for treatment. He initially did not want to report the matter to the police because the

threats were fresh on his mind. However, after speaking to his superior, DSP Sugumaran Bala

("PS9"), he decided otherwise. He lodged a report the same day at 9.25 pm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 The incident at Sim Lim Tower ("the second incident") was the subject

of the present appeal. PW1 and PW2 corroborated PW5s account up to the point of the first

incident. PW1 added that he too was assaulted and, as a result, lost consciousness. When he came

round, everyone had left. PW2s recount of the subsequent events was that he fled before the first

assault occurred. When he returned a while later, no one was at the scene.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 During the trial, ASP Avadiar ("PW3") described the raid at the pub

conducted on 3 April 1999, which led to the arrest of nine Indian men, including the appellant. Sgt

Wong Lip Wing ("PW4") testified on the identity parade conducted on the same day, in which

PW5 decisively picked out the appellant. The defence did not suggest that the identity parade was

improperly conducted.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The evidence of the defence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 The defence case was essentially that the appellant was not present at the

scene of either incident and hence was not a member of the unlawful assembly. The appellant said

that he and Vasuthevan s/o Armuthelingam ("DW2") left their fathers restaurant for the

pub at about 11.30 pm on 6 March 1999. At the pub, he met some acquaintances. They left at closing

time, which was about 2 am. DW2 went to the washroom, so the appellant went outside the pub to wait

for him. He saw a white Mercedes speeding down the road, and a crowd clamouring for its registration

number. When DW2 emerged from the pub, they left for home.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 DW2s evidence was essentially the same. He stressed that the appellant was

not involved in any fight that night.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The district judges decision</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 The judge delivered her very detailed grounds of decision on 31 May 2001. She

first set out the prosecution evidence and the defence evidence.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 The judge then set out the law on identification evidence, and proceeded to

examine the quality of PW5s identification evidence in relation to the second incident. She found

that the quality of such evidence was good.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 She held that the appellants credit had not been impeached. Having said

that, she was of the impression that he was not a credible witness. She also ruled that PW2s

credit and PW5s credit had also not been impeached. While the defence did not seek to impeach PW7s

credit, the judge nonetheless noted that he was an evasive witness. The judge considered the law

relating to discrepancies in witnesses evidence, and held that the discrepancies in the evidence

of PW1, PW2 and PW5 were minor and could be disregarded.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 The judge then set out the law on s 116 Illustration (g) of the Evidence Act

(Cap 97). She declined to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for failing to call PW5s

friend, as the prosecution had not been shown to have withheld evidence from the appellant or the

court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 The judge found that the evidence of the defence witnesses was inconsistent.

She also did not give DW2s evidence much weight.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 The judge then set out the ingredients of the offence in s 146 of the Penal

Code. She found that the appellant was a member of an unlawful assembly, the common object of which

was to hurt PW5, and that force had been used in prosecution of that common object.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 Finally, the judge considered a few precedents on sentencing in rioting cases.

In sentencing the appellant, she bore in mind the aggravating factors, which were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a          PW5 was subject to

    physical abuse and gruelling interrogation for about an hour.</p>
<p align="justify">b          PW5 was not allowed

    to seek medical attention for his injuries, for about an hour.</p>
<p align="justify">c          The persons

    comprising the unlawful assembly knew that PW5 was a police, yet continued  with their

    behaviour regardless.</p>
<p align="justify">d          In conducting his

    defence, the appellant made serious allegations about PW5s integrity.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The only mitigating factors were that the appellant himself did not physically

harm PW5; and the members of the unlawful assembly did not go beyond slapping PW5.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 Finally, the judge considered whether this was a case which warranted the

imposition of the maximum sentence of five years and caning prescribed under s 147 of the Penal

Code. She concluded that it did not, but that it merited a sentence close to it.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The issues</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 The issues in the appeal were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>a          Did the prosecution prove beyond a

    reasonable doubt that the appellant was present at      the scene of

    the second incident?</p>
<p align="justify">b         If so, was the appellant

    guilty of the offence of rioting?</p>
<p align="justify">c         Whether the following

    witnesses were credible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">i        PW2 and PW5, against both of

      whom impeachment exercises were conducted;</p>
<p align="justify">ii       PW5 and S/Sgt Abdul Halim b Haji

      Mohd ("PW7"), in relation to a statement   contained in the Full Incident

      Report, allegedly made at 5.38 am on 7

      March           1999;</p>
<p align="justify">iii      PW1, PW2 and PW5 <i>inter se</i>; and</p>
<p align="justify">iv      the appellant and DW2 <i>inter se</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">d       Whether the judge should have drawn an

    adverse inference under s 116 Illustration (g) of the  Evidence Act against the prosecution

    for failing to call PW5s friend, to whom he claimed

    to            have spoken on Madras

    Street, before the first incident occurred.</p>
<p align="justify">e       Whether the sentence imposed was

    manifestly excessive.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 In dealing with this appeal, the court bore in mind certain well-established

principles. Determinations by trial judges often involve an assessment of both the facts and the

witnesses demeanour. The relationship between objective evidence and the trial judges findings

on the veracity of a witness was set out in <i>PP v Yeo Choon Poh</i> <nobr>[1994] 2 SLR 867</nobr>:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in <i>Tara Singh &amp; Ors v PP </i><nobr>[1949] MLJ 88</nobr> at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not

  to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In the present case, the judge was careful to state, in relation to every

witness, that her conclusions were based on both objective evidence and the witness demeanour.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 What then, is the role of the appellate court in relation to the trial judges

findings based on fact and those based on demeanour? The starting point was <i>Yap Giau Beng Terence

v PP </i><nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 656</nobr>:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial

  judges findings of fact, <i>especially where they hinge on the trial judges assessment of

  the credibility and veracity of witnesses</i>, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or

  against the weight of evidence</p>
<p align="justify">Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual

  findings  an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary

  inferences of fact (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 It has however to be recognised that this dichotomy cannot be too strictly

applied. The appellate court only sees the record of proceedings, which are words on a printed page.

The same words can be coloured differently by different types of demeanour. The result of the

interaction between the witness demeanour and his or her words cannot be overlooked. As I said in

<i>PP v Julia Elizabeth Tubbs </i>MA 42/2001:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In the normal case, a judge sitting on appeal should be sensitive to <i>the

  impressionistic nuances which invariably contribute to the inferences drawn</i> by the trial

  judge, who had the opportunity of observing and evaluating the evidence first-hand. (<i>emphasis

  added</i>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The first issue: identification evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 The starting point was <i>Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP </i><nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 465</nobr>, which

adapted the <i>Turnbull</i> guidelines to the Singapore legal system. In dealing with identification

evidence, the principles to be applied were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a               

  Does the prosecutions case depend wholly or substantially on the correctness of the

  identification    evidence?</p>
<p align="justify">b               

  If so, is the identification evidence of good quality, considering the circumstances in which

  the           identification was made?</p>
<p align="justify">c               

  If the identification evidence is of poor quality, is there any other evidence which supports

  the            correctness of the

  identification?</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 Under part (b) above, a non-exhaustive list of factors includes:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a             

  The length of time that the witness observed the accused: in this case, PW5 glanced at the

  appellant for five to eight seconds each time.</p>
<p align="justify">b             

  The distance at which the observation was made: in this case, the appellant was never more than

  seven metres away from PW5. PW5 could see the appellants entire body.</p>
<p align="justify">c             

  The number of times the witness had seen the accused: in this case, PW5 stole several glances at

  the   appellant during the second incident.</p>
<p align="justify">d             

  Any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused: in this case, PW5 was put through

  a     harrowing experience. As was pointed out in <i>PP v L (a minor) </i><nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 219</nobr>, this was likely

  to                 

  carve the assailants image indelibly into the victims mind:</p>
<p align="justify">              

  It seemed to me that it was <i>precisely the fact that</i> she had been molested which would have

  caused   [the witness] to take a really good look at her molester and commit his face to

  her memory. (<i>emphasis           added</i>)</p>
<p align="justify">e             

  the length of time between the original observation and the identification to the police: in this

  case, it was less than a month.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 Moreover, there was sufficient lighting at Sim Lim Tower for PW5 to see the

appellant clearly. There were three fluorescent lights to PW5s right, and a light from the

carpark driveway above. Although there was blood in PW5s eyes, he was given some water to wash

the blood off his face. The judge found that, despite his fear, PW5 was lucid enough to reason

through his chances of escape and to try to look at his assailants so that he could identify them if

need be.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 There was no reason to overturn the judges finding that the quality of the

identification evidence was good.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The second issue: the offence of rioting</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 The offence of rioting is defined in s 146 as:</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">146. Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any

  member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, every member of such

  assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 The first element of the offence is that the appellant was a member of an

unlawful assembly. The meaning of "unlawful assembly" most relevant to this case was in s

141(c):</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">141. An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an "unlawful

  assembly", if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is </p>
<p align="justify">(c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 The first requirement under this element is that the common object of the

assembly was, for example, to commit an offence. <i>Lim Thian Hor v PP </i><nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 258</nobr> drew a

distinction between "common object" and "similar or same object". For the

former, "it is essential that the object should be common to the persons who constitute the

assembly and they should be aware of it and concur in it." In the present case, there was no

doubt that the group of men knew of and concurred in the plan to cause hurt to PW5. They had

gathered at Sim Lim Tower for that purpose. The common object, causing hurt to a person, obviously

fell within the definition of an "offence".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 The second requirement under this element is that there must have been at

least five members of the assembly. A "member of an unlawful assembly" is also defined in

the statute:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">142. Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful

  assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it, is said to be a member of an

  unlawful assembly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This requirement was satisfied in the present case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 The second element is that violence or force was used in carrying out the

common object. This need only be used by any one or more members of the unlawful assembly. This

element was also present in the present case, as some of the men had slapped PW5. It was irrelevant

for issues of liability that the appellant did not use force against PW5.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The third issue: the credibility of the witnesses</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33 As for point (i) in paragraph 20(c) above, only PW5s credibility was dealt

with in the appeal, as PW2s evidence did not extend to the second incident. Point (iii) was not

dealt with, because that part of PW5s evidence which PW1 and PW2 corroborated also did not relate

to the second incident.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34 Point (i) will be discussed first. The key charge which could be levelled at

PW5s credibility was that he had lied to the doctors at the hospital that he had sustained his

injuries from a fall. This should not greatly affect his credibility for two reasons:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a         The judge found that he was

  genuinely afraid of reprisals from his assailants, should the police come to   

  know of the incident. This was not an irrational fear, for his assailants knew his address, and

  that he had a           wife and young children.</p>
<p align="justify">b         In any case, he told the

  police the truth on the same day.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35 Point (ii) was also related to PW5s credibility. The defence sought to show

that PW5s testimony was inconsistent with a statement he had made to PW7, which was reflected in

the Full Incident Report. The entry at 5.38 am stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">SIO Halim informed that according to SIO Rajan, earlier he had a drinking

  session at the said pub and had a fall, resulting in some slight injuries on the forehead. No

  dispute or fight took place. Anyway, SIO Rajan is safe and sound at home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Both PW5 and PW7 denied that PW5 had said that: one, he had been drinking at the

pub; and two, he was at home at 5.38 am. The judge reasoned that, if PW5 did not want the police to

find out about the assaults, he would have avoided mentioning the pub. The evidence also showed that

PW5 had registered himself at the hospital at 5.03 am, and hence it was very unlikely that he was

home by 5.38 am. There was no reason to doubt such logic. As for PW5s lie about his sustaining

injuries from a fall, the discussion in paragraph 34 above applies.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 The Full Incident Report showed that PW7 was more involved in the case than he

would admit. Apparently he had instructed his officers to go to the pub when he heard that PW5 was

missing. These were unilateral actions on his part, and there was no evidence that PW5 knew about

them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37 As regards point (iv), the defence opined that insufficient weight was given

to DW2s evidence. I think the judge was correct in not placing much weight on his evidence

because:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a          DW2 had been to the

  same pub with the appellant on several occasions, and there was nothing special   about

  that occasion. In fact, it was the appellant who informed DW2, after he was released from

  the               police

  station, that there had been an assault that night.</p>
<p align="justify">b          DW2s evidence was

  inconsistent with that of the appellant, PW1, PW2 and PW5. DW2 said that the   

  scene outside the pub after closing time was calm, with people milling around. According to the

  others,               there

  was a rather agitated crowd outside the pub.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">The fourth issue: the prosecutions failure to call a witness</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38 Section 116 Illustration (g) of the Evidence Act provides:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The court may presume </p>
<p align="justify">(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced by

    unfavourable to the person who withholds it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39 The general principle is that a presumption will only arise if it constitutes

a withholding of evidence from the accused or the court (<i>Yeo Choon Huat v PP </i><nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 217</nobr>). In determining whether evidence has been withheld, the factors which should be considered

include:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a     How material was the evidence of the witness who

    was not produced? (<i>Chua Keem Long  

    v          PP </i><nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 510</nobr>)</p>
<p align="justify">b     Did the prosecution intend to hinder or hamper the

    defence? (<i>Chua Keem Long v PP</i>)</p>
<p align="justify">c     Was the witness absence from court brought about

    by the inaction of the defence? (<i>Tan Ah   Lay v PP </i>Criminal Appeal 14/93,

    Unreported)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40 In the present case, PW5s friend was not a material witness, as his

evidence would pertain only to matters even before the first incident. The prosecution could not be

said to have hindered the defence because they made the defence aware of the existence of and role

played by PW5s friend. Hence the defence could have called this witness, but chose not to.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The fifth issue: sentencing</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41 The punishment prescribed for this offence is set out in s 147:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">147. Whoever is guilty of rioting shall be punished with imprisonment for a

    term which may extend to 5 years and shall also be liable to caning.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42 According to <i>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</i>, the

sentencing range for non-secret society related cases is 18 to 24 months imprisonment. However,

there were many aggravating factors and relatively few mitigating ones. The former include:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a       The second incident was premeditated.

    Three of the assailants took PW5 to Sim Lim Tower, and must have informed the rest to join them

    there.</p>
<p align="justify">b       PW5 was subject to terror for an hour,

    in a deserted location. There was both mental and     physical abuse.</p>
<p align="justify">c       While PW5s injuries were due to the

    first, not the second, assault, the members of the second unlawful assembly persisted despite

    the fact that PW5 was already injured.</p>
<p align="justify">d       The appellant had criminal records,

    including a similar antecedent. He was sentenced to 18    months probation for

    attempted theft in 1995, but breached probation by committing

    an            offence of rioting. He was

    sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and six strokes of the

    cane         for that offence, and a further six months

    imprisonment for breaching probation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43 The mitigating factors were those stated by the judge (see paragraph 18

above). These were far outweighed by the aggravating factors. I did not think the sentence imposed

was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Motion to adduce fresh evidence: Criminal Motion 29 of 2001</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44 On 14 September 2001, the appellant filed a notice of motion that the defence

would seek to admit fresh evidence at the hearing. One Kesavan s/o Seenivasan ("Kesavan"),

who was convicted of criminal intimidation and rioting in respect of the second incident, was

willing to testify that the appellant was not present at the scene.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45 The High Courts power to receive additional evidence is found in s 257(1)

of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68):</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks

    additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken

    by a District Court or Magistrates Court.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46 The principles which apply to the exercise of this power were enunciated in <i>Ladd

v Marshall </i>[1954] 3 All ER 745 and adopted in <i>Jumaat b Samad v PP </i><nobr>[1993] SLR 338</nobr>. The

court would exercise its power only if:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a     The evidence could not have been obtained with

    reasonable diligence for use at the trial;</p>
<p align="justify">b     The evidence is such that, if given, it would

    probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive;

    and</p>
<p align="justify">c     The evidence is credible.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47 As for the first condition, it was true that Kesavan turned himself in to the

police only after the conclusion of the appellants trial. But it was the defences case that

Kesavan and the appellant were childhood friends, and were still acquainted at the time of the

assaults. That being so, the appellant was in a better position than any other party in this case to

obtain Kesevans evidence. However, the defence could not produce evidence of any attempts which

the appellant had made to contact Kesavan before the appellant was tried. I was of the opinion that

the evidence could have been obtained for use at the trial, had reasonable diligence been used.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48 With regards to the second condition, it was difficult to see how Kesavans

evidence could have an important influence on the result of the case. The crux of the judges

decision was based on PW5s identification evidence, which was found to be reliable. Kesavans

evidence would not challenge that finding. Indeed, it is rather odd for the defence to attempt to

prove that the appellant was <i>not </i>at Sim Lim Tower, rather than that he <i>was</i> somewhere

else.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49 The third hurdle, too, was not cleared. It was sufficient to refer to <i>Chung

Tuck Kwai v PP </i><nobr>[1998] 2 SLR 693</nobr>, which disposed of the matter:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">At this stage of appeal, the prosecution would not have the opportunity of

    cross-examining [the witness] to determine his credibility. <i>The additional evidence was of

    such a nature that it ought not to be accepted as credible without [him] being put to

    cross-examination</i>. (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Hence I dismissed the motion to adduce fresh evidence.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50 In view of the above, I dismissed the appeal.<font size="4"></font></p>
